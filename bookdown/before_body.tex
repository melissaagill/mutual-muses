\chapter*{Introduction}

Mutual Muses is a crowdsourced transcription project undertaken by the Digital Art History program at the Getty Research Institute in 2017. The project crowdsourced transcriptions of correspondence from the archives of art critic Lawrence Alloway (1926-1990) and feminist artist Sylvia Sleigh (ca. 1916-2010), which are held at the Getty Research Institute in Los Angeles. These letters reveal the intimate early stages of their respective professional careers and intertwined personal lives in postwar England from 1948-1953. The project was hosted on Zooniverse, an open-source, ``citizen science'' platform that facilitates collaboration between volunteers and researchers working on data collection research projects. The results of this project included transcription data for 2,376 documents from these archives.
