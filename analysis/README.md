This directory contains the raw data exports from Zooniverse (in `/analysis/data`), as well as the R code we used to process and analyze the results.

This code has been packaged using [packrat](https://rstudio.github.io/packrat/), so all package dependencies are included under `/analysis/packrat`.
Simply starting an interactive R session in `/analysis/` should trigger the bootstrapped installation of packrat, followed by all necessary dependencies.

You should then be able to run all the code included in `/analysis/mutual_muses_final.Rmd`
