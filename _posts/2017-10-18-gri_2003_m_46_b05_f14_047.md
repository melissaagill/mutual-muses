      Dearest Lawrence,
      I am delighted with my [unclear]dish[/unclear] for his gay and vigorous letters! The he is working so well inspite of disappointments. I adore you and long to be with you. I wait with gentle loving impatience working as hard as I can so that all will be ready. I am so glad you like my sketch for the still-life. I worked on it most of today and have nearly finished the coffee pot.
      After tea I went for a nice walk with [unclear]Fairy[/unclear]. When I have finished this painting which with I hope be Thursday or Friday I shall at the earliest opportunity (weather) put in the peas - having composted first! Then I shall work as hard and quickly as I can on my still-life (the [unclear]contrious[/unclear] one)
