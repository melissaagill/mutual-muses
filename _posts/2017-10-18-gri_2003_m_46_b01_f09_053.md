      Dearest Sylvia,

      What a good idea to collaborate, you an I, on Wright of
      Derby or Dobson. I should are to, not only for the reasons
      that come first to mind (I am a lover first, then a critic, I
      admit it), but because it would produce something excellent.
      I often wish as I do this book for your opinion on a multi-
      tude of points. Obviously it is not possible as things are
      at present between Michael, Sylvia, and Lawrence. But how I
      should love to work with you. Without you I shall only go
      on for a limited time writing books - with you I should have
      the motif to be more energetic.

      Good, oh, good, you are painting again. Dandylion is
      delighted. But - 'Michael likes it so far' you saw. 'So
      far'. And what happens when he stops liking it? Do not,
      darling, be dependant on Michael's approval or disapproval,
      anymore than you are on Tiny's funny opinions. I know he
      is more likely to be right than Tiny, but it is rather as if
      a Poussin were always at the elbow of a Rubens, and Rubens,
      instead of Poussin to keep to his own kind of paint-
      ing, accepted his advice and toned down, modified, corrected,
      adjusted, his own vigorous conceptions which are alien to
      the other painter. Look at your own development this year
      and you can do so with complacency I think: do you ascribe
      this progress to Michael's advice or to yourself.

      Your new material sounds charming and I anticipate very
      pleasurably seeing you in it.

      I am so glad you like my sonnet and that you have bought
      a notebook for my poems. Your comparison of the sonnet with
      Hubert was exactly right but I must say I thought Michael's
      suggestion of Chiswick House ridiculous. Pyramid, colonnade,
      Campagna, Rome; does this recall Chiswick which is after all
      about to be restored? The Bath poem is still as it was at
      Bath because I have just nothave time to do more than revise
      one or two bits and pieces. Then it is done you shall have
      the first copy. I love you and must write many more poems.

      About the library tickets: do you think you could renew
      them yourself by post, telling them that you divide your time
      between town and country? Otherwise they may simply tell you
      to join the Pett Public Library. Sorry to put you to this
      trouble but it would be of considerable help to this author.
      Where can I get opinions if I can't read library books after all?

      I love you. I shall write you a note at the end of the day's
      work this evening. It is 9.30 now and I must get down to H.
      I love you.

      Lawrence

      I enclose a page from my Analysis of Beauty chapter: it is a typical page

      you and I, on Wright of Derby or Dobson. I should adore to, not only for the
      reasons that come first to mind (I am a lover first, then a critic, I admit
      it), but because it would produce something excellent. I often wish as I do
      this book for your opinion on a multi-tude of points. Obviously it is not possible
      as things are at present between Michael, Sylvia, and Lawrence. But how I should
      love to work with you. Without you I shall only go on for a limited time writing
      books -  withyou I should have the motif to be more energetic. \n\nGood, oh,
      goof, you are painting again. Dandylion is delighted.  But - 'Michael likes
      it so far' you say. 'So far'. And what happens when he stops liking it? Do not,
      darling, be dependant on Michael's approval or disapproval, anymore than you
      are on Tiny's funny opinions. I know he is more likely to be right than Tiny,
      but it is rather as if a Poussin were always at the elbow of a Rubens, and Rubens,
      instead of telling Poussin to keep to his own kind of paint-ing, accepted his
      advice and toned down, modified, corrected, adjusted, his own vigorous conceptions
      which are alien to the other painter. Look at your own development this year
      and you can do so with complacency I think: do you ascribe this progress to
      Michael's advice or to yourself.\n\nYour new material sounds charming and I
      anticipate very pleasurably seeing you in it.\n\nI am so glad you like my sonnet
      and that you have bought a notebook for my poems. Your comparison of the sonnet
      with Hubert was exactly right but I must say I thought Michael's suggestion
      of Chiswick House ridiculous. Pyramid, colonade, Campagna, Rome: does this recall
      Chiswich which is after all about to be restored? The Bath poem is still as
      it was at Bath because I have just not had time to do more than revise one or
      two bits and pieces. When it is done you shall have the first copy. I love you
      and must write many more poems.\n\nAbout the library tickets: do you think you
      could renew them yourself by post, telling them that you divide your time between
      town and country? Otherwise they may simply tell you to join the Pett Public
      Library. Sorry to put you to this trouble but it would be of considerable help
      to this author. Where can I get opinions if I can't read library books after
      all?\n\nI love you. I shall write you a note at the end of the day's work this
      evening. It is 9.30 now and I must get down to H.\nI love you.\nLawrence\n[unclear]I

Do not, darling, be dependent on Michael's approval or disapproval, anymore than you are on Tiny's funny opinions.
