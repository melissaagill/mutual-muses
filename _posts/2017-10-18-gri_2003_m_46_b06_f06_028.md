      Dearest Sylvia

      I will take a train that arrives at Brighten at
      11:00. pr as near to that time as possible. I sug-
      gest that, if it is convenient, we will use the taxi I will have come in to take your luggage to the station. Then we will have a little [unclear] weiee[/unclear] in Brighton before catching the Belle at 1:25. Time for lunch and perhaps, a stroll. If you disagree we can let the taxi go. Longing to see you. All my love adore you Laurene
