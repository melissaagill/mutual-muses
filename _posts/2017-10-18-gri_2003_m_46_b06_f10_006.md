      Apart from these and other young sculptors, Moore and Hep-
      worth are represented.  Moore is showing one of those rootless,
      panicky experiments which have occupied him lately.  A bronze
      Mother and Child (1952) reminds one of Lipchitz, especially in
      the transformation of the baby into something like a hungry guitar.
      Such a transformation of cubism is stale now.  Hepworth, unlike
      Moore, has continued developing logically, but in her way she, too,
      is disappointing:  her Small Stone with Strings (1951-52) is
      mature but stereotyped.
