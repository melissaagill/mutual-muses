      I think that your delightful monkey is a very good idea indeed for Rinaldo and Armida and I congratulate you on a dazzling piece of invention. I must try and write a suitable singer for her. If eel very spoiled and complacent that you send me so many sketches. I hope she will keep still for you to paint her...

      I saw Connie, from Bath, and she was very nice: said that I was looking much fatter than last Christmas, admired my socks, invited me, again, to Bath, and studied my Minerva ring with much praise. She has seen it before but wanted to admire it again. How much nicer her attitude to, say, Iris' stuff one or mother who always says if I look tired but never if I look well.

      My Gothic painting lecture was a success and I talked from 7.30 to 9.45 about it. I did not know I knew enough to: just listening I learned a lot... Next week it is classical stories, Mrs. Smith says Arachne is one of her favorite characters: I suppose that she considers her fate a hard one.

      I hope housework is not too formidable and that you are sleeping well. I will write again tomorrow.

      How much, my Muse, my lover, my painter, my adorable enchanter, how much I love you,

      I think that your delightful monkey is a very good idea indeed
      for Rinado and Armida and I congratulate you on a dazzling piece
      of invention.  I must try and write a suitable singerie for her.
      I feel very spoiled and comlacent that you send me so many sketches.
      I hope she will keep still for you to paint her...

      I saw Connie, from Bath, and she was very nice: said that I
      was looking much fatter than last Christmas, admired my socks,
      invited me, again, to Bath, and studied my Minerva ring with
      much praise.  She has seen it before but wanted to ad-
      mire it again.  How much nicer her attitude to, say, Iris'
      stuffy one or mother who always says if I look tired but never
      if I look well.

      My Gothic painting lecture was a success and I talked from
      7:30 to 9:45 about it.  I did not know I knew enough to: just
      listening I learned a lot...  Next week it is classical stories.
      Mrs Smith says Arachne is one of her favorite characters: I sup-
      pose that she considers her fate a hard one.

      I hope housework is not too formidable and that you are
      sleeping well.  I will write again tomorrow.

      How much, mu Muse, my lover, my painter, my adorable enchanter,
      how much I love you,
      Lawrence
