      19 v 1953
      Dearest Sylvia:
      Today's lecture was well attended, 40-45 people for Monet. I was pleased by that.
      I rang up ART NEWS to ask for the Henry Moore exh. at ICA and ended up with it and the Sutherland exh. at the Tate, as well - 1000 words. I am madly busy & Christ knows how I shall meet a Friday morning deadline but I accepted.
      I must find a title for my article: something like 'Up from the Country' or 'Back to the Land' or 'The town mouse as country mouse', &c.
      The Sutherland exh. looks better than I expected - with some unfamiliar works and some of this year's paintings. Charles gave me lunch today; asked me to pay for myself but when I told him I couldn't he was very nice about it, really rather sweet the way he handled it. He can be nice as you say.
