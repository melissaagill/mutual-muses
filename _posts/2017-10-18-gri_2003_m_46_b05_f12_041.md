      II

      Glass balls make a planetary
      System around the dark green sun,
      Indifferent to entropy.

      Comets graze those silver tail
      On the windows of the Earth.

      Tree of many in the one.

      Stars, by brings and fans, are trailed.

      Whether we know it's death or birth
      It is suitable for a feast.

      So the room curves in the globe
      Bobbing on the branch at the least
      World-shaking extra-galactic step.

      The footprints
      In tomorrow's snow
      Is walked then by
      The lion of today

      III

      You know where I stand, but sacrifice
      gives order to the Christmas chaos.

      The languid worning is a lolling head.
      The glazing bars a cross:
      That's who we celebrate, whose blood we dodge
      the rest of the christened year.
