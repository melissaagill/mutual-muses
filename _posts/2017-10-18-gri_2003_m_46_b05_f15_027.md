      Dearest Lawrence,
       How pleasing to find your Ward Article in Art News - but did you see A. Redpath's drawing! Heavens - what next! It looks like deprived Freud (L.) if such a thing could be!
      As you have so many lectures on Saturday and travelling on Sunday is Hell - what about my coming on Monday or even Tuesday is that suits you better - I could catch the 10.10 in comfort and arrive about 12.0. I think that would suit me better as I might finish - or at least nearly finish my essay of Sunderland jugs which is going well, and put in the rest of the seeds. I am very pleased with my large still life - but fool that I am, - I have exceeded the size of the frame - painting right up to the edge of the linen!

      Dearest Laurence,

      How pleasing to find your Ward article in Art News - but did you see A. Redpath's drawing!  Heavens - what next!  It looks like[unclear] debased Laeud (L.)[/unclear] if such a thing could be!

      As you have so many lectures on Saturday and travelling on Sunday is hell - what about my coming on Monday or even Tuesday if that suits you better - I could catch the 10.10 in comfort and arrive about 12.0.  I think that would suit me better as I might finish - or at least nearly finish my essay of [unclear]Suuderland jugs[/unclear] which is going well, and put in the test of the seeds.  I am very pleased with my large still life - but fool that I am - I have exceeded the size  of the frame - painting right up to the edge of the linen!
