      Dearest Sylvia
      Your lion is home. Here he will stay, too. Thank you for your

      stat mode (as Dandy could not bring himself to port with the
      original) Lionel rushed off to Venice to join her. He should be
      there very soon.

      Thank you, darling, for your birthday wishes. I am in my
      birthday shoes even now as I write to you. It is 7:15 so I
      must not write at length if you are to have this letter in
      the post tomorrow.

      As the lecture is on again I (and Clifford) will come to
      Pett on Friday. I have to go to Lincoln on the 2nd October.
      I will work out and let you know my movements. I will
      stay with you until the last moment you may be sure.

      I am sad to think that Tiny is away. But I am cheered

      I am getting better very fast.

      post tomorrow.\n   As the lecture is on again I (and Clifford) will come to
      \nPett on Friday.  I have to go to Lincoln on the 2nd October.  \nI will work
