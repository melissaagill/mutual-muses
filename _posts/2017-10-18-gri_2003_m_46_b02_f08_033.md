      III

      taste is worth more than anything I can say. If we should have it, do get it. If you are not satisfied, Let us wait. I shall be happy either way for I am sure you will decide rightly.

           I hope you were able to get Modern Painters at such a reasonable price as you hoped?

           Your fears about the results of the pound devaluation are rather generalised: France at least is still easily accessible. Italy is down 600 liera, as far as we are concerned. I am delighted that England is producing her own wines - it seems to be the only thing that is plentiful, judging from a list of vegetable crops in The Times. Your account of picking the [unclear]curled[/unclear] vines was charming and made me long for you.

           It is raining, softly, steadily. My hair will be quite destroyed - and be shapeless for days. I shall not go to Ted until nearer your visit, however. I am resolved to wait.

           I have got a book of poems by Wright's friend Hayley which contains a long poem about Painting and Painters and an Ode to Mr. Wright. I look forward to collaborating with you so much. I still remember how brilliant were your judgments and comments at the Derby Art Gallery.

      III

      taste is worth more than anything I can say. If we should have it, do get it. If you are not satisfied, let us wait. I shall be happy either way for I am sure you will decide rightly.

      I hope you were able to get Modern Painters at such a reasonable price as you hoped?

      Your fears about the results of the pound devaluation are rather generalised: France at least is still easily accessible. Italy is down 600 liera, as far as we are concerned. I am delighted that England is producing her own wines - it seems to be the only thing that is plentiful, judging from a list of vegetable crops in The Times. Your account of picking the [unclear]wrlct[/unclear] vines was charming and made me long for you.

      It is raining, softly, steadily. My hair will be quite destroyed - and be shapeless for days. I shall not go to Ted until nearer your visit, however. I am resolved to wait.

      I have got a book of poems by Wright's friend Hayley which contains a long poem about Painting and Painters and Ode to Mr. Wright. I look forward to collaborating with you so much. I still remember how brilliant were your judgement and comment at the Derby Art Gallery.

      I am charmed by a choice of words at the end of your second letter - you say you look forward to "hearing" my chapters. I am so pleased you chose that word and did not say "reading".

      I love you: I miss you very much and long for Tuesday. My rose, my dove, I love you. Tell me you love me, I love you.

      P.S. I have several pictures of a nude Minerva by Cellini which may give you an idea for your Minerva. It is a magnificent piece.
