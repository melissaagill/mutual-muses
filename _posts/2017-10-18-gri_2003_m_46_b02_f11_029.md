      The first to pass were resless  [unclear][/unclear] amonini,
      A tumbling tableau of chaotic love:
      Bottoms, lips, and ears, or holy goals
      Had equal value to their unshaped will
      as objects of desire ...
      Some flew in lisenc after logs
      And others straddled goats and pissed upon
      Their copulating twins and rivals

                           (6)
      I witnessed next the second stage of love -
      Those [unclear][/unclear]amoresls whom genital desire
      offers Venetian softness and its strength,
      Their heads, in may cases, wound with vine.
      Their bodies of mature [unclear][/unclear]denising,
      These couples made a ring or pyramid
      As active in the course of love they moved
      Accustomed to the pleasure of their choice.

      The first to [unclear]pairs[/unclear] were restless [unclear]amonini[/unclear],
      A trembling tableau of chaotic love:
      Bottoms, lips, and ears, or holy goats
      Had equal value to their unshaped will
      As objects of desire ...
      Some flew in lisence after toys
      And others straddled goats and pissed upon
      Their copulating twins and rivals

      (6)

      I witnessed next the second stage of love -
      Those amorests whom genital desire
      offers Venetian softness and its strength,
      Their heads, in many cases, wound with vine,
      Their bodies of nature desiring,
      These couples made a ring or pyramid
      As active in the course of love they moved
      Accustomed to the pleasure of their choice.
