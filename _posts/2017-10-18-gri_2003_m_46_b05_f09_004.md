      Molly is not awfully well. I'm sorry to say. I don't think I have
      got it quite straight, but some part of her face may be toxic and this
      affects her eyes - it is hard to focus, things are muggy. She has
      an appointment with someone at a hospital, a fortnight tomorrow!
      It is not bad when she is sitting down, inactive, apparently. (She
      looks awfully white.)

      The butcher's daughter - who writes romances under the name
      of Margeruite Clare - is waiting with barely - concealed impat-
      ience for my verdict on her new novel. Mother has a copy
      for me. It deals with Paris, a haunted castle, night clubs,
      the secret of a crystal box... I shall read and make some
      psycloanalytic guesses for our amusement - and write to
      the girl (I cannot avoid it) though what I shall say to her I am
      uncertain. (Would you care to read her book?)

      The wireless is on. Here is a quote from a new song:
      They call me the Rock of Gibraltar.
      They say my heart is made of stone.
      So don't you try to lead me to the altar
      Because Gibraltar is standing alone.

      Not bad in its simple minded, popular way, would you say?

      I wonder what you are doing now? It is 12:15. (Certainly
      not listening to the radio). Painting, gossiping, dusting,
      slapping? I wonder, I wonder.

      Oh Sylvia I adore, adore, adore you
      I love you
      Lawrence
