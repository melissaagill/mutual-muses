      Dearest Lawrence
      I expect you may be at home
      (in Blackheath) again now. I hope
      in bed as it has just struck
      12 and I am a naughty cad to
      be writing now! I am in bed.
      I feel particularly sad at leaving
      you this time, as you know I have
      sometimes remained reasonably
      happy - only having to think of you
      and some loving gestures to feel
      completely at harmony with the world!
      Now I feel that you have reverted
      somewhat to your earlier more nar-
      cissistic attitude and I feel that
      you love me that much less although
      you do not altogether realize it
      yourself I think. I do hope I
      am mistaken.
      I arrived here safely after
      A stuffy but uneventful journey.
      Everyone smoked so that I was very
      glad of my lozenges and took no
