However the desire to please was stronger than shyness & they completed the poem. Almost all were inaudible but Janet. one of 2 of the name, started well with

      The rest was lost however when she was overcome & had to turn her back on me and press against the wall in utter confusion.
      One boy, John, has a crush on me. He is 11 or 12 and is, it must be admitted semi-deficient. He plays, not with his contemporaries but 7 and 8 year old girls.

      April 2 - Redbourne
      The children who spend all their time here saw me writing a poem
      to you (recognised the shape) and arranged a poetry recital for me.
      They arranged themselves on the stage at one end of the hall. One
      boy (Norman) claimed to know 15 pieces but when challenged pro-
      duced 2 and a bit. Two little girls recited together, one with her
      arms twisted behind her head, the other rotating one leg with
      embarrassment. However the desire to please was stronger than
      shyness & they completed the poem. Almost all were inaudible
      but Janet, one of 2 of the name, started well with
      I wish I were an apple on a tree.
      I'd fall upon a pretty girl like me.
      The rest was lost however when she was overcome & had to
      turn her back on me and press against the wall in utter confus-
      ion.

      One boy, John, has a crush on me. He is 11 or 12 and is, it
      must be admitted, semi-deficient. He plays, not with his
      contemporaries but 7 and 8 year old girls. He resents time I
      spend with anyone else and I had to reproach him the other day
      for fighting with a 7 year old girl (for my favours). He be-
      came sullen & slouched round & round the hall (in very heavy
      boots) whistling on one ear-splitting note. I expelled him but
      he comes in still, chastened, but [unclear]snivelling.[/unclear] Incidentally
      the children are not in at present because Saturday afternoon
      they go to the pictures: they will be in after tea, I imagine, though.

      I am going to dismantle the exhibition tonight at about 6
      o'clock. I can't believe that tomorrow I shall not have to answer
      questions about 'detail' and 'realism' and 'beauty'. What will remain
      on the walls of memory - if I live to be 23 - are the superb, the un-
      forced, cliches.
      The [unclear]minitons[/unclear] here, & I've had more than a hundred in 8
      days - are never at a loss for nonsense or vulgarity: they have a
      commonplace at every finger tip. They have no individuality but a
      marvellously effective collective identity - if 'identity' is not
      too strong a word. The population is 3 or 4,000, so a hundred plus
      is quite good.
