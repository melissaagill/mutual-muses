      3    there so that you won't get this for
      days.  However he might get some sense

      I'm glad that "Decemboat" is good--
      you had better take me to it when I
      am next in town, and very glad
      to hear you have written so much.  I hope
      to hear it from you when you come.
      You will have heard that this lecture
      will not take place, you may have
      it published.  I don't know.  Any
      way I hope you read it to me.
      I suppose the Lincoln girls do not
      expect very long lectures, and 15
      is nice, after all you don't work
      every day.
      I'm sorry 'May' Athene isn't out
      you, why ever not?
      The cold you gave me is coming
      out, and I feel very disgruntled
      Tiny is her usual cross fussing little
      Hampton self and it is possible
      that she will spend a fortnight then
