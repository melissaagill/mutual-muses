    annotation_text: "2. too \"urban-minded\". Lucy is looking very well. I am glad
      to say and somewhat fatter. She is in bed at the moment as she slightly sprained
      her ankle, she twisted her foot on an iron gate-stop hidden in the grass at
      Cliff End. But I think the rest will do her good. Doris is at the house and
      in spite of the doctors is getting better every day - but of course she may
      have a relapse anytime. Lucy is going to LittleHampton again on Thursday and
      will be away about a fortnight. Michael says he is going to Cambridge Monday
      fortnight - so I will come and see you then - while I can! If that will fit
      with your arrangements. \n\nWere you able to review the Henry VIII letters?
      I haven't been able to finish the notes yet so perhaps I'd better send it back.
      What do you think?"
