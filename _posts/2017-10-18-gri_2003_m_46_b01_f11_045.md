      Dearest Sylvia,

      I have got my slacks - they are grey Daks and very nicely cut. Next I must get a check shirt - dark, so very practical. I have finished my reviews and shall post them off tomorrow. My literary cliche seem to be on their toes I'm glad to say. Enough of me - except to give you the news, already know to you but which I can repeat without making you impatient, that I love you.

      It is three days since I saw you. In one way it seems longer because I need your presence so badly. In another way you are close because my thoughts rarely leave you - and I have your pictures, locket, letters. But love cannot grow plump and tall on such fare - though during the time of separation I adore it - and I long to be with you.

      Tomorrow I shall see John Skipp at Eve Sheldon-Williams party and I hope to arrange then about Blackheath or at least start arrangements. I have learned a bit about the place since your enthusiasm encouraged me and it sounds very nice in many ways.

      Dearest Sylvia,
      I have got my slacks -- they are grey Daks and very nicely cut. Next I must get a check shirt -- dark, so very practical. I have finished my reviews and shall post them off tomorrow. My literary cliche seem to be on their toes I'm glad to say. Enough of me -- except to give you the news, already known to oyu but which I can repeat without making you impatient, that I love you.
      It is three days since I saw you. In one way it seems longer because I need your presence so badly. In another way you are close because my thoughts rarely leave you -- and I have your pictures, locket, letters. But love cannot grow plump and tall on such fare -- though during the time of separation I adore it -- and I long to be with you.
      Tomorrow I shall see John Skipp at Eve Sheldon-Williams party and I hope to arrange then about Blackheath or at least start arrangements. I have learned a bit about the place since your enthusiasm encouraged me and it sounds very nice in many ways.
