      have to advise you that Mr. Greenwood the owner of this flat entered here recently

      will appreciate that I can no longer be responsible for the safety of the contents
      of his flat since he or his friends may enter here at any time in the absence
      of my wife and myself. I shall of course do all I can to look after Mr. Greenwood's
      property.\nI have also failed to obtain any receipt for the rent I have paid
      although I asked for these some time ago.\nWhen asked for the receipts, Mrs.
      Greenwood replied that her husband would like to see me to \"discuss\" them.\nI
      view of this somewhat peculiar way of my landlord conducting business I have
      asked him to negotiate with me through yourselves in future.\nI shall be glad

      Mr. Marsh\nI have to advise that Mr. Greenwood the owner of this flat entered
      here recently by using his own key during my absence and without my invitation.
      His explanation to my wife who was sleeping as that he had failed to obtain
      an answer to a letter of his or to telephone calls he said he had made. In view
      of this you will appreciate that I can no longer be responsible for the safety
      of the contents of his flat since he or his friends may enter here at any time
      in the absence of my wife and myself. I shall of course do all I can to look
      after Mr. Greenwood's property.\n\nI have also failed to obtain any receipt
      for the rent I have paid although I asked for these some time ago.\n\nWhen asked
      for the receipts, Mrs. Greenwood replied that her husband would like to see
      me to \"discuss\" them.\n\nIn view of this somewhat peculiar way of my landlord
      conducting business I have asked him to negotiate with me through yourselves
      in future.\n\nI shall be glad if you kindly endeavor to obtain receipts for
      the three sums of 25.10.0. I have paid to Mrs. Greenwood.\n\nYours faithfully,
      \nM.G. Maxwell "
