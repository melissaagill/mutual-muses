      21st May

      Our Italian trip was planned to be a kind of honeymoon and I do so wish for it not to be reduced from a happy and marvellous prelude into merely another interruption of your torment and my loneliness. If you leave Michael before we go, the journey will serve to distract you, and Michael is anyway expecting you to be away.
      So I ask - once again: do the one act and then I can soothe you with my love which has never been stronger than now.
      Then my love will [unclear]work creatively[/unclear] in the way which you have taught me yourself.
      Your efforts at compromise have not worked so I ask of you this one action which I can justify [unclear]& love[/unclear] once you make it. If after being with me you are not happy you need not stay but it is our best hope if you will live with me and visit Michael and not the other way round.
      I know summer would be nicer at Pett than Blackheath but I am making it as nice as I can and you would visit Pett and probably live there eventually with me.
      If you stay with M. remember what we suspect you would have to fight again the battle to keep M. at Pett.

      21st May
      Our Italian trip was planned to be a kind of honeymoon and I do so wish for it not to be reduced from a happy and marvellous prelude into merely another interruption of your torment and my loneliness. If you lave michael before we go, the journey will serve to distract you, and michael is anyway expecting you to be away. So I ask - once again, do the one act and then I can soothe you with my love which has never been stronger than now.  Then my love will work creatives in the wway which you have caught me yourself. Your efforts at compromise have not worked so I ask of you this one action which I can justify ???? once you make it.  If after being with me you are not happy you need not stay but it is our best hope if you will live with me and visit Michael and not the other way round.
      I know summer would be nicer at Pelt than Blackheath but I am making it as nice as I can and you would visit Pelt and probably live there eventually with me.  If you stay with M. remember that we suspect you would have to fight again the battle to keep M. at Pelt.
