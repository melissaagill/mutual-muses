      Polydor (ii)

      His head a fan-light and his arms folded
      On the rectangular panels of his lungs,
      The seventh poet solves the world of objects
      By his empathic union with their shapes.

      One of the poets at one of the doors
      Examines the cult of darkness by the lamps
      Burning like flowers on the tenebrist carpet,
      Preparing his senses for the Epic, Night.

      Caryatid of the so-called bridal suite,
      Record with Pindar's athletic content
      The [unclear]hboks[/unclear] and eyes, the buttons and holes,
      All moving softly the other side of the door.

      Operatic poet, do you not fear
      To tear the pillow of silence, break
      The vases in the delicate ears within
      Of the girl of whose sunsets you are sentry.

      The enigmatic as the poet's matter:
      Diagonal creases on the hidden bed,
      Are like geology of hidden springs
      Below the sleeper in the further room.

      A poet in sunglasses at the twelfth door
      Makes a bonfire of his early lovers,
      The odes now derelict as empty houses
      And the ramshackle sonnets of the stairs.

      Instead of a handle one door has a hand
      Caressing a poet's genitals:
      Roses flow from the keyhole
      And stifle the trellis of his happy limbs.

      Polydor  (ii)

      His head a fan-light and his arms folded
      On the rectangular panels of his lungs,
      The seventh poet solves the world of objects
      By his empathic union with their shapes.

      One of the poets at one of the doors
      Examines the cult of darkness by the lamps
      Burning like flowers on the tenebrist carpet,
      Preparing his senses for the Epic, Night.

      Caryatid of the so-called bridal suite,
      Record with Pindar's athletic content
      The hooks and eyes, the buttons and the holes,
      All moving softly the other side of the door.

      Operatic poet, do you not fear
      To tear the pillow of silence, break
      The vases in the delicate ears within
      Of the girl of whose sunsets you are sentry.

      The enigmatic as the poet's matter:
      Diagonal creases on the hidden bed,
      Are like geology of hidden springs
      Below the sleeper in the further room.

      A poet in sunglasses at the twelfth door
      Makes a bon-fire of his early lovers,
      The odes now derelict as empty houses
      And the ramshackle sonnets of the stairs.

      Instead of a handle one door has a hand
      Caressing a poet's genitals:
      Roses flow from the keyhole
      And stifle the trellis of his happy limbs.
