      I should like to thank you for the charming poems and delightful drawings - but as they say in Novels my heart is like lead - nothing could be a more pathetic contrast than your two letters - your hopes and the reality.

      have a 20 over-draft at the bank on which you will have to pay interest, and when you get the 15 in October you will still have to pay rent then and live.
