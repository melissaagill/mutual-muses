      On the Train
      20 x 50
      Dearest Sylvia
      I am on my way to B'ham on a 4 1/2 journey: I am rather tired and I shall be quite glad when my lecture & journey are over for a day or two. My host at  Muntingdon was Oscar Johnson, a director at Legatt Gallery & he has offered to show me 2 unknown Hogaraths & assist me with photograph and information for the new book. He lives in a [unclear]C[/unclear] 16th H. plan house in a walled, many- layered garden. We talked until one this morning drinking whiskey in a room containing several Constables & Gainsboroughs, Rembrandt, Velvet Brueghal, and Bonington. I felt very spoiled and mellow.
      The afternoon lecture at [unclear]Bury[/unclear] S. Edmunds to a less sophisticated audience was successful I think. Everybody gives me meals so I have needed to spend very little. John Johnson the Arts Council Regional Director came to both lectures. He was very nice about the lectures & said my method was like Pevsner's, whom he had immediately before called a very good lecture.
      I miss not having news of you & your new painting. I am excited to see it - and the portrait of a cat with the [unclear]Savage[/unclear].
      B'ham
      I am now at the hotel & have just checked over my notes. I think I am ready for Renoir. The hotel is the one, the Queen's, at which we stayed nearly 2 years ago. I love you & wish you were here now. Ah my ravishing creature, I love you.
      I hope you are working well & sleeping well
      I love you
      Lawrence
