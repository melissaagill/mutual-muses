      Blackheath
      5 ix 1950
      Dearest Sylvia,
      I hope you will be able to make a start on your painting
      soon: your letter sounds enthusiastic and fills me with hope
      that you will work well.  Hetty, of course, is with you to
      act as Muse but Dandy will look after himself, he promises.

      It is early Tuesday morning and soon I must be off for my
      morning lecture.  I stayed at Wimbledon until Monday morning
      because I could not leave immediately Father had given me £50.
      I shall be debtless in a few days: we shall be able to walk
      round the village freely, now.  Bernard Gay came to Wimbledon
      on Sunday and took away some books in payment for his mobile :
      so it is our mobile, now.

      Miss Chick has written to ask me to lecture (provisionally)
      for a week in March.  If I can only add a few more such en-
      gagements ahead things won't be too bad.

      Here is a sonnet (alas, unrhymed) for you, my beauty, my
      Muse :
      The eremetical attributes
      With which I strew the hollow cave,
      Are blue as unconsoling walls
      The sky erects in empty shires
      Between this solitude and your
      Rural Victorian retreat:
      Blue thoughtful skull, blue book and bell,
      Eyes in a mirror left by you.

      In the black plain, beyond the cross,
      Beyond the precincts of the ferns -
      Soft as lingerie folded by the wind,
      Blue neon models swaying clouds
      Near the tower by the canal
      And the almost stationary clock.

      (Your hermit lion, and your blue neoned Mazawatee factory.)

      There is a newly cleaned Cuyp belonging to the Kind in the N.G.
      which we must have missed when we say the St George by Rubens.
      The A.I.A. gallery may close down in December as there is a new
      land-lord who will put the rent up, I think.  Poor D. Uhlman-
      it's her life!  I hear she's thin already ... Thinner, anyway.

      I love you my dream, my pleasure-principle, my beauty,
      I adore you,
      Dandy

      because I could not leave immediately Father had given me 50.
      I shall be debtless in a few days; we shall be able to walk
      round the village freely, now.  Bernard Gay came to WImbledon
      on Sunday and took away some books in payment for his mobile:

      And the almost stationary clock.

      (Your hermit lion, and your blue neoned Mazawatee factory.)

      There is a newly cleaned Cup belonging to the King in the N.G.
      which we must have missed when we saw the St George by Rubens.

      Dearest Sylvia,

      I hope you will be able to make a start on your painting soon: your letter sounds enthusiastic and fills me with hope that you will work well. Hetty, of course, is with you to act as Muse but Dandy will look after himself, he promises.

      It is early Tuesday morning and soon I must be off for my morning lecture. I stayed at Wimbledon until Monday morning because I could not leave immediately Father had given me £50. I shall be debtless in a few days: we shall be able to walk round the village freely, now. Bernard Gay came to Wimbledon on Sunday and took away some books in payment for his mobile: so it is our mobile, now.

      Miss Chick has written to ask me to lecture (provisionally) for a week in March. If I can only add a few more such engagements ahead things won't be too bad.

      Here is a sonnet (alas, unrhymed) for you, my beauty, my Muse:

      The eremitical attributes
      With which I strew the hollow cave,
      Are blue as unconsoling walls
      The sky erects in empty shires
      Between this solitude and your
      Rural Victorian retreat:
      Blue thoughtful skull, blue book and bell,
      Eyes in a mirror left by you.

      In the black pain, beyond the cross,
      Beyond the precincts of the ferns -
      Soft as lingerie folded by the wind,
      Blue neon models swaying clouds
      Near the tower by the canal
      And the almost stationary clock.

      (Your hermit lion, and your blue neoned Mazawatee factory.)

      There is a newly cleaned Cuyp belonging  to the King in the N.G. which we must have missed when we saw the St George by Rubens. The A.I.A. gallery may close down in December as there is a new land-lord who will put the rent up, I think. Poor D. Uhlman- it's her life! I hear she's thin already... Thinner, anyway.

      I love you my dream, my pleasure-principle, my beauty,

      I adore you,
      Dandy

      ask me to lecture (provisionally)<br/>for a week in March.  If I can only add
      a few more such en-<br/>gagements ahead things won''t be too bad.<br/><br/>Here
      is a sonnet (alas, unrhymed) for you, my beauty, my<br/>Muse:<br/><br/>The eremetical
      attributes<br/>With which I strew the hollow cave,<br/>Are blue as unconsoling
      walls<br/>The sky erects in empty shires<br/>Between this solitude and your<br/>Rural
      Victorian retreat:<br/>Blue thoughtful skull, blue book and bell,<br/>Eyes in
      a mirror left by you.<br/><br/>In the black plain, beyond the cross,<br/>Beyond
      the precincts of the ferns - <br/>Soft as lingerie folded by the wind,<br/>Blue
      neon models swaying clouds<br/>Near the tower by the canal<br/>And the almost
      stationary clock.<br/><br/>(Your hermit lion, and your blue neoned Mazawatee
      factory.)<br/><br/>There is a newly cleaned Cuyp belonging to the King in the
      N .G .<br/>which we must have missed when we saw the St George by Rubens.<br/>The
      A . I . A . gallery may close down in December as there is a new<br/>land-lord
      who will put the RENT up, I think.  Poor D. Uhlman-<br/>it''s her life!  I hear
      she''s thin already...  Thinner, anyway.<br/><br/>I love you my dream, my pleasure-principle,
      my beauty,<br/><br/>I adore you,<br/>Dandy'
