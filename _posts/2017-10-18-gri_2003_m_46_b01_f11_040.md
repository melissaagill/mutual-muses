      The tawny owl has looked it up and he reports there are at least six Wright of Derby's at Derby and numerous drawings. I shall write to them before we go in case not everything is on view. Or, rather, let my tawny secretary do it.

      This morning Rose, Observer editor, sent me the Phaidon Hogarth, and Ayrton's book, to review. The Phaidon book is admirable and I cannot wait to show it to you. (Now I shan't have to buy it.) I have been drafting other reviews this morning and must have a look at Keith Vaughan again before I have tea with Johnson this afternoon.

      In Wimbledon it is dark today. I hope you have enough light at Pett to do your painting from the window which sounds lovely.

      Sylvia, I love you. We shall be happy, loving, creative.

      I will write again very soon with poems and more expressions of love. Oh, how wonderful to see you yesterday.
