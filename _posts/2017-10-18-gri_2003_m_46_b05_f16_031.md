      Dearest Lawrence
      Thank you for your letter. I'm so glad that you had a good audience on Tuesday and I hope that you did on Thursday too. I feel sure that your Tuesday lecture was very good even though you seem rather critical of it. I wish I had heard it.
      I have now put in all my [unclear]feels[/unclear] for the moment - and have worked more on Clifford's nude which is going well. I hope to start another painting tomorrow. I went to the rehearsal last night and really it is very good. Thorp is superb! The back cloth is a scene such as could be found on a black lacquer cabinet and it more effective.

      Thank you for your letter I'm
      so glad that you had a good audience
      on Tuesday and I hope that you
      did on Thursday too. I feel sure
      that your Tuesday lecture was very
      good, even though you seem rather
      critical of it. I wish I had heard
      it.
      I have now put in all my seeds for
      the moment - and have worked more
      on Clifford's nude which is going well.
      I hope to start another painting to-
      morrow. I went to the rehearsal
      last night and really it is very
      good - Thorp is superb! The back
      cloth is a scene such as could
      be found on a black laquer cabinet
      and is most effective.
