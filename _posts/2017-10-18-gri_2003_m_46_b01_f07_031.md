      Phone: WIMbledon, 1967
      11, Mansel Road,
      Wimbledon, S.W. 19

      28th August 1948
      My dearest Sylvia
      I hope that Michael and you are settling down at Pelt and that your visit to me has not made Micheal too unhappy. I know how hard it is for you when he is depressed so I hope you are getting along happily.
      Johnson asked me if you were back yesterday. I said I thought you must be by now as I had had a "note" from Venice the week before in which you promised a return soon but gave no date. I hope that is the right sort of thing to say.
      It occurs to me that before the end of the month there might be details about the feat, some [unclear]errand[/unclear] or other, which would be difficult to do by correspondence.
