      The lecture is over & I am in the train waiting in 7 station.
      I am never quite certain about W.I. lectures but I think this one went off
      rather well - with the bits of felt to illustrate colours & its relationships.
      I felt like a conjurer. They asked me if I knew somebody to lecture
      on Pottery & China - so I gave them your name & address. I am
      not sure if you would like to take it or not - but you certainly
      know enough, & it would have to be an elementary lecture for
      150-200 women. They may not contact you - but they well may -
      I wonder how your painting went today? The hours of daylight
      are short, alas, but it was Epiphany on 6th so perhaps the longer
      mornings will soon be perceptible.
      The train is returning via stations that used to be names gurgled
      over the loudspeaker at London Bridge on cold nights if you remember
      then - Knock halt, Orpington, Chislehurst, A. Hither Green and so on.
      As far as I'm concerned I never want to get out at these stations -
      suburban whistle-stops only. Soon I will be home  at Black-
      heath I cannot get back fast enough. The W.I. hall was cold - so is the train.
      I am going to ring Iris's Andre up because he is in Belgia &
      he can tell me how to pronounce WOESTIJNE  & such musical names. Then, apart from reading a book of 'Mondrian', my B'ham
      lecture is ready. (I am looking forward to the PRB again!)
      Dearest love, your beauty, your vitality, genius inspire me.
      Forgive your Lion his weakness. It was the winter. Now
      the Shortest Day is past he recovers. I adore you,
      I adore you
      Lawrence

      The lecture is over & I am in the train waiting in 7 station.
      I am never quite certain about W.I. lectures but I think this one went off
      rather well - with the bits of felt to illustrate colors & its relationships.
      I felt like a conjurer. They asked me if I knew somebody to lecture
      on Pottery & China - so I gave them your name & address. I am
      not sure if you would like to take it or not - but you  certainly
      know enough, & it would have to be an elementary lecture for
      150-200 women. They may not contact you - but they well may.
      I wonder how your painting went today? The hours of daylight
      are short, alas, but it was Epiphany on the 6th so perhaps the longer
      mornings  will soon be perceptible.
      The train is returning via stations that used to be names gurgled
      over the loudspeaker at London Bridge on cold nights: you remember
      them - Knockholt, Orpington, Chislehurst, Hither Green, and so on.
      As far as I'm concerned I never want to get out at [unclear]these[/unclear] stations -
      suburban whistle-stops only. Soon I will be home at Black-
      heath. I cannot get back fast enough. The W I hall was
      cold - so is the train.
      I am going to ring Iris's Andr√© up because he is Belgian &
      he can tell me how to pronounce WOESTIJNE & such musical
      names. Then, apart from reading a book by Mondrian, my B'ham
      lecture is ready. (I am looking forward to the P R B again!)
      Dearest love, your beauty, vitality, genius inspire me.
      Forgive your lion his weakness. It was the Winter. Now
      the Shortest Day is past he recovers. I adore you,
      I adore you
      Lawrence
