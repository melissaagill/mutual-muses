      Dearest Lawrence
      Thank you for your letter and for bearing with all my grumbles and writing as often - I do appreciate it and it helped me a lot. I slept very well last night. Tiny put me to bed with hot milk and codeine and I feel marvelously better this morning, and therefore more cheerful. Yesterday I wrote a lot of the cards to go with the P.V. cards and that was a great relief to me - Michael has send more envelopes so I can pass some on to Beryl, I have already sent some to Georgie! Thank you so much for ringing up Chase - the cards haven't come yet.
      The framing is going quite well, I need to buy 3 more so that's not so bad. Yes "Tiny Tots" in the next letter will do fine. Are you doing The Contemporary Arts people? I believe you are - and "the Three Young Collectors"!
      I hope that your Banstead lecture went well - I should like to hear it!

      Dearest Lawrence,

      Thank you for your letter and for bearing with all my grumbles and writing so often - I do appreciate it and it helped me a lot. I slept very well last night. Tiny put me to bed with hot milk and codeine and I feel marvellously better this morning; and therefore more cheerful. Yesterday I wrote a lot of the cards to go with the P.V. cards and that was a great relief to me - Michael has sent more envelopes so I can pass some on to Beryl, I have already sent some to Georgie! Thank you so much for ringing up Chase - the cards haven't come yet.

      The framing is going quite well, I need to buy [unclear]3[/unclear] more so that's not so bad. Yes "Tiny [unclear]Tots[/unclear]" in the next letter will do fine. Are you doing the Contemporary Arts people? I believe you are - and "The Thee Young Collectors"!?

      I hope that your Barnstead lecture went well - I should like to hear it!

      Dearest Lawrence,

      Thank you for your letter and for bearing with all my grumbles and writing so often - I do appreciate it and it helped me a lot. I slept very well last night. Tiny put me to bed with hot milk and codeine and I feel marvellously better this morning; and therefore more cheerful.  Yesterday I wrote a lot of the cards to go with the P.V. cards and that was a great relief to me - Michael has sent more envelopes so I can pass some on to Beryl, I have already sent some to Georgie.  Thank you so much for ringing up Chase - the cards haven't come yet.

      The framing is going quite well, I need to buy 3 more so that's not so bad. Yes "Tiny Tots" in the next letter will do fine. Are you doing the Contemporary Arts people? I believe you are - and "the Three Young Collectors"!?

      I hope that your Banstead lecture went well - I should like to hear it!
