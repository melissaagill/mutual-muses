      BLACKHEATH 25th January 1950

      Dearest Sylvia,

      Thank you for your second letter which I received last night when I returned from a pleasant evening with Paul. His shoes are admirable: no news about the revue yet, it is today he is having lunch with the people connected with it. Yes, do let's go to Mrs Toft on the 8th February, before a Banstead lecture.

      I bought Rewald's History of Impressionism yesterday so I have plenty of facts and dates about the artists for this evening's lecture. It will help me, too, to make my N.G. lecture formidable on Saturday. This morning I have read two more chapters of The Picturesque and have now accumulated seven pages of notes on the subject. It is fascinating.

      Thursday evening my parents are going to take me to Le Roi, the new Maurice Chevalier film, a remake of Le Roi s'Amuse. To morrow before going I shall do some work on (a) picturesque, (b) impressionists, and (c) psycho-analysing Hogarth. After such various study I shall probably seem a lion with three heads:

      The marmalade is roofed, by the way, and I will try for your button tomorrow.

      I hope you are well, my darling. I love you

      BLACKHEATH 25th January 1950

      Dearest Sylvia,
      Thank you for your second letter which I received
      last night when I returned from a pleasant evening
      with Paul.  His shoes are admirable: no news about
      the revue yet, it is today he is having lunch with
      the people connected  with it.  Yes, do let's go to
      Mrs Toft on the 8th February, before a Panstead lec-
      ture.

      I bought Rewald's History of Impressionism yester-
      day so I have plenty of facts and dates about the art-
      ists for this evening's lecture.  It will help me,
      too, to make my N.G. lecture formidable on Saturday.
      This morning I have read two more chapters of The
      Picturesque and I have now accumulated seven pages of
      notes on the subject.  It is fascinating.

      Thursday evening my parents are going to take me
      to Le Roi, the new Maurice Chevalier film, a remake
      of Le Roi's s'Amuse. To morrow before going I shall
      do some work on (a) picturesque, (b) impressionists,
      and (c) psycho-analysing Hogarth.  After such var-
      ied study I shall probably seem a lion with three
      heads:

      The marmalade is roofed, by the way, and I will
      try for your button tomorrow.

      I hope you are well, my darling.  I love you.

      BLACKHEATH  25th January 1950
      Dearest Sylvia

      Thank you for your second letter which I received
      last night when I returned from a pleasent everning
      with Paul.  His shoes are admirable: no news about
      the revive yet, it is today he is having lunch with
      the people connected with it.  Yes, do let's go to
      Mrs Toft on the 8th February, before a Banstead Lec-
      ture.

      I bought Rewald's History of Impressionism yester-
      day so I have plenty of facts and dates about the art-
      ists for this evening's lecture.  It will help me,
      too, to make my N.G. lecture formidable on Saturday.
      This morning I have read two more chapters of The
      Picturesque and have now accumulated seven pages of
      notes on the subject.  It is fascinating.

      Thursday evening my parents are going to take me
      to Le Roi, the new Maurice Chevalier film, a remake
      of Le Rois' Amuse.  Tomorrow before going I shall
      do some work on (a) picturesqued, (b) impressionists,
      and (c) psycho-analysing Hogarth.  After such var-
      ied study I shall probably seem a lion with three
      heads:

      The marmalade is roofed, by the way, and I will
      try for your button tomorrow.

      I hope you are well, my darling.  I love you
      Lawence
