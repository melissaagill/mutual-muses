      And another line by Drayton. Love and the Poet
      are exchanging [unclear]moments[/unclear].
      'As well,' saith he 'too forward as to slow.'
      The truth of this was not always known to
      me, Sylvia.
      I wish I knew what the weather will do.
      It is 11.15 now and sun and cloud alter-
      nate. I might go to Hampton Court for it
      is free today and a shilling tomorrow.
      whatever I do I shall think of you. I ex-
      pect you are in the kitchen at the moment
      (my poor owl, my poor cat) and I am look-
      ing forward very much to washing-up
      again. I have not done it since last
      time in Pett.
      How I love you. I wish I could organise
      a triumph in your honour. Thousands of bour-
      geois should be deployed in such a manner
      as to write your name by their massing. I
      should then set fire to them and have your
      name inscribed in fire in the pleasant
      evening. Fireworks of a kind. Next a
      process of owls and cats with roses in
      their beaks and mouths. This would go on
      for two days and there would be banquets
      going on at the same time in case you tired
      of this procession. However I must con-
      tinue this phantasy in another letter. I
      have only a little room to say I love
      you , very dearly, very madly.
      Lawrence
      P.S. Could you conveniently return [unclear]Sewanee[/unclear]
      as I need it for some notes I am making?
