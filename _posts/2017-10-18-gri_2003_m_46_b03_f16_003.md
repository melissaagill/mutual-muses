      Dearest Lawrence
      I hope to hear this morning something of your adventures. J. and G. arrived here for lunch on Sunday and were very affectionate and encouraging. They left on Monday morning - we enjoyed their visit - G. brought us a "Life" with colourful illustrations of modern American painting which I will show you.

      On Saturday we bathed but it was rather cold - yesterday when the tide was right it was windy and overcast. Are you going to Brighton this week-end? I hope so and that the weather is good. M. goes hopping, rising at 6 a.m. and getting home at 5 for 'tea' feeling rather tired. Yesterday I went to the Savages and if it is not fine I shall go again to-day. I hope the portrait will be all right- the tone is not quite "synthesized' at present. I haven't forgotten my other projects and shall work at them soon.

      Mary Jane is here, and says her brother may come soon!

      Well that's all the news - there isn't
