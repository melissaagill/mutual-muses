      I do hope you have luck with the
      Tate - though as you say the chances
      are rather slender. Still you have

      5 Sylvia has bought Hetty a tea cloth
      in place of the ones she accidentally
      burned - I shall send it wrapt round
      the "Letters" in a day or two.
      I love you, my dearest one, look
      after yourself - heed my earlier injunctions.
      I do hope you have luck with the
      Tate - though as you say the chances
      are rather slender - still you have
      had experience "preparing things for
      publication!
      I love you, dearest Poet
      I love you
      Sylvia

      P.S. You will be pleased to hear that
      the Mill along Panel Lane - it stands
      on Hog Hill, I understand is being
      restored by it's owner - one Merrick -
      who fortunately is rich - it was in
      "The Times" with picture 2 weeks
      ago.
