      SYLVIA SLEIGH
      9 . 2 . 52
      (Sunday)
      Dearest Lawrence,
      I have just been going
      over my accounts with Tiny
      and I am very anxious for I
      have already spent more than
      the rent which was paid for
      the flat - and of course I
      should be living on that until the
      22nd of this month, also I
      have some bills to pay and
      the repairs to the beds at the flat.
      In fact I cannot pay Tiny her
      rent which is an awful thing
      as I hate to owe her a penny
      and they are very hard up
      at present because of Clifford's
      fares - In consequence I daren't
      come up until Saturday after-
      noon
