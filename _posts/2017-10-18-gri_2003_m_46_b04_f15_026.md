      My Dear Lawrence,
      I enclose the 'baby' and also a letter from the 'Professor'! I have used all the books received to date.
      If you don't think the effusion is up to scratch don't put it in. I shan't mind a bit, but if you care to use it I shall be very glad.
      Do come down here soon if you can.
      Love from us both
      C,
      P.S.  I have an assignation with Kinsey now!
