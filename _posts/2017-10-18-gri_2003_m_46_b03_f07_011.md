      In the [unclear]Berengaria[/unclear]
      13 XI 50
      Dearest Sylvia
      I am just having lunch before setting off for Liverpool Street. I have been to Hinds & paid them though of course I was not able to collect the material which they will keep for us.
      I looked in at the N.G. to see the 3 new galleries. 120 Dutch pictures & about 24 Italians make up the total. Add it to the 2 galleries of Dutch 17th C pictures upstairs...! The milkman's horses' taste is obviously plebian.
      You loving letter delighted me, my exquisite rose, my beauty. I do look forward to seeing your flight (despite your fears), but, even more, I want to see you again - my only love, my muse.
      I enclose a drawing (!) of the Budapest Alley - only [unclear][/unclear] Bronzes to give you some idea of it and the MS. draft of the article. And my new poem, revised again. Do you like the title?
      I hope you are painting in fact as in my imagination.
      I love you
