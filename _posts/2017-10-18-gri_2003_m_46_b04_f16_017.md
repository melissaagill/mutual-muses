      Thank you so much for your ebulient
      letter and the delightful poems
      I will book on the coach going on
      Saturday afternoon, and shall be
      very happy to be met - I fear you
      will be very busy this week.
      I feel rather tired to-day as
      I have been trying to do all the
      thinks I have not done during
      the days that I have been
      painting so hard.
      Forgive me if I write no
      more at present -
      I would like to say however
      that I much admire "Words as
      Things".
      I love you
      Sylvia

      P.S. Please have you ordered the
      2 magazines from your father?
      and have you sent back Kurt's MSS? S.
