      has some MSS to show me, but can't promise it for weeks. He did his best to discourage me but when I simply became tougher wished me luck sincerely. I stressed very much that I wanted lecture to supplement my bursary. He said if there was anything he could do to help. He seems rather slow-witted. Incidentally I went into the N.P.G. as St. Martin's struck 12, so I was not late as you feared I would be. If I'd realised I had as much time as that I'd have tried to keep you talked even longer because your voice is important to me though I know the telephone is a long way from ideal. But I am a 'villain' as you say in that adorable tone of yours.

      I turned out some old letters last night and discovered one from the [unclear]Bardon[/unclear] University dated 1946 saying, No I must wait until next year to do my interim exam. I confess I gave a delighted exclamation when I thought of the far reaching results of my late application. Please don't think this heartless in view of your present woe. I know you won't. I value you so very much. I love you, dearest Sylvia, as only a Dandelion can. I love you.

      Lawrence

      P.s. Another varied envelope. And, alas, the letter a mere page from a notebook. Sorry to appear so boyish in my choice of materials but I hope you will overlook if for the sake of what I have to say - the theme on which all my letters are variations - our mutual love.
