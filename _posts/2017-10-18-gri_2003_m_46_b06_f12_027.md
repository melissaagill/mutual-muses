      Blackheath
      23 December
      Dearest Sylvia
      Happy Christmas my darling: I love you so much, and though we are not together I feel as if you were here, as I joyfully anticipate our future Christmases together.
      Let me tell you my Christmas movements: Christmas Eve at Magda's (sleeping overnight); then to Wimbledon, where I shall stay from Christmas day until Sunday night or Monday Morning. I shall definitely be back here on Monday. I shall not be away as long as usual.
      I am so pleased to hear that you persuaded Diana to go to the Rye artists' party and glad it was enjoyable.
      Your presents from you aunts sound marvellous. I have done well from my Tate Gallery people: two two guinea book tokens. With one I have bought A GRAMMER OF MOTIVE by Kenneth Burke. You know how I like him.
      Your party with the Savages and Diana sound so nice: I wish i could have been there. George with whiskey as usual.
      Early today I went to Wimbledon and put up the Christmas decorations, just vegetation of various kinds: I did my best to make indoor trees and arches since the holly, from the garden, was exceptionally large.
      Pasmore fell off his bicycle the other day and has fractured his hip. This means no exh. at Cambridge and he will miss a term at Newcastle: also he didn't come to me for coffee. I'm visiting him after Christmas. Isn't it a shame!
      Lion is helping Magda out with silver for tomorrow so I must go any polish it. Ho - hum.
      I have some ideas for, or rather feelings for, poems. I hope I may have a chance to get something done in the next few days.
      I had long and delightful dreams about you last night and hope for more of the same tonight. I think of you all day too you may be sure. You are my life and my dream. I love and adore you. Happy Christmas and all my love.
      Adore you
      Lawrence

      23 December

      Dearest Sylvia

      Happy Christmas my darling: I love you so much, and
      though we are not together I feel as if you were here,
      as I joyfully anticipate our future Christmases to-
      gether.

      Let me tell you my Christmas movements: Christmas Eve
      at Hagda's (sleeping overnight); then to Wimbledon,
      when I shall stay from Christmas day until Sunday night
      or Monday Morning. I shall definitely be back here on
      Monday. I shall not be away as long as usual.

      I am so pleased to hear that you persuaded Diana to go
      to the Rye artists' party and glad it was enjoyable.

      Your presents from your aunts sound marvellous. I have
      done well from my Tate Gallery people: two two guinea
      book tokens. With one I have bought A GRAMMER OF MOTIVE
      by Kenneth Burke. You know how I like him.

      Your party with the Savages and Diana sounds so nice: I
      wish I could have been there. George with whiskey as
      usual.

      Early today I went to Wimbledon and put up the Christ-
      mas decorations, just vegetation of various kinds: I did
      my best to make indoor trees and arches since the holly,
      from the garden, was exceptionally large.

      Pasmore fell off his bicycle the other day and has fract-
      ured his hip. This means no exh. at Cambridge and he will
      miss a term at Newcastle: also he didn't come to me for
      coffee. I'm visiting him after Christmas. Isn't it a shame!

      Lion is helping Hagda out with silver for tomorrow so I must
      go and polish it. Ho-hum.

      I have some ideas for, or rather feelings for, poems. I hope
      I may have a chance to get something done in the next few days.

      I had long and delightful dreams about you last night and
      hope for more of the same tonight. I think of you all day
      too you may be sure. You are my life and my dream. I love
      and adore you. Happy Christmas and all my love

      I adore you

      23 December

      Dearest Sylvia

      Happy Christmas my darling: I love you so much, and though we are not together I feel as if you were here, as I joyfully anticipate our future Christmases together.

      Let me tell you my Christmas movements: Christmas Eve at Magda's (sleeping overnight); then to Wimbledon, where I shall stay from Christmas day until Sunday night or Monday morning.  I shall definitely be back here on Monday.  I shall not be away as long as usual.

      I am so pleased to hear that you persuaded Diana to go to the Rye artists' party and glad it was enjoyable.

      Your presents from your aunts sound marvellous.  I have done well from my Tate Gallery people: two two guinea book tokens.  With one I have bought A GRAMMER OF MOTIVE by Kenneth Burke.  You know how I like him.

      Your party with the Savages and Diana sounds so nice: I wish I could have been there.  George with whiskey as usual.

      Early today I went to Wimbledon and put up the Christmas decorations, just vegetation of various kinds: I did my best to make indoor trees and arches since the holly, from the garden, was exceptionally large.

      Pasmore fell off his bicycle the other day and has fractured his hip.  This means no exh. at Cambridge and he will miss a term at Newcastle: also he didn't come to me for coffee.  I'm visiting him after Christmas.  Isn't it a shame!

      Lion is helping Magda out with silver for tomorrow so I must go and polish it.  Ho-hum.

      I have some ideas for, or rather feelings for, poems.  I hope I may have a chance to get something done in the next few days.

      I had long and delightful dreams about you last night and hope for more of the same tonight.  I think of you all day too you may be sure.  You are my life and my dream.  I love and adore you.  Happy Christmas and all my love.

      Adore you
      Lawrence
