      11th December 1948    Wimbledon

      Dearest Sylvia,

            Thank you so much for your letters-two of which I received today.  You can imagine how happy this made me.  One came first post and the other was waiting for me when I came home a few minutes ago after a walk on the Common and tea with Molly.
           What splendid news about our portrait.  I am so proud of your achievement, dearest, it is a wonderful painting.  I long to see it complete.
            I am glad that Tiny likes my chapter.   I will correct the sentence she criticized.  I expect several corrections and additions will have to be made before it is published but it is the main body of words I am aiming at now.  I have not written much on Hogarth in the last few days because of lectures but I am making notes for several chapters at once.
           I shall take a room next week so we need not wait much after Christmas-please.

      What splendid news about your portrait. I am so proud of your achievement, dearest, it is a wonderful painting. I long to see it complete.

      I am glad that Tiny likes my chapter. I will correct the sentence she criticised. I expect several corrections and additions will have to be made before it is published but it is the main body of words that I am aiming at now. I have not written much on Hogarth in the last days because of lectures but I am making notes for several chapters at once.

      I shall take a room next week so we need not wait much after Christmas - please.

      you so much for your letters - two of which I received today. You can imagine
      how happy this made me. One came first post and the other was waiting for me
      when I came home a few minutes ago after a walk on the Common and tea with Molly.<br/><br/>What
