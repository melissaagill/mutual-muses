      Carter's Farm tells me that a lot of it
      was rotten so would have fallen if not
      out.  I shall look forward to it's re-
      growth.
      Yesterday I read O Wilders' poem 'the Spinx'
      it has some very delightful things in it -
      though one wishes for a little more variety
      of metre and rhyme - So long a poem.
      I think it is a very youthful one - I
      hope to, for the emotional attitued is dis-
      tinctly immature. I have also begun D.Gray!
      and I have done a little to my [unclear][/unclear] - which
      I like more and more.
      My darling, I love you, I miss you so much
      and long to see you again.  I hope all goes
      well with you and you have either got
      some money or manage to negotiate a
      loan.  By the way don't forget to write
      to Miss Fawell about that N.G. lecture
      and don't forget to get some work from
      Gainsborough.  I see AP.B.S. did one
      article on Hetion and Buffet in A.S.R
      I love you, dearest Poet,
      I love you,
      Sylvia

      carter's farm tells me that a lot of it was rotten so would have fallen if not cut. I shall look forward to it's regrowth.
      Yesterday I read O. Wilde's poem 'The Sphinx' it has some very delightful things in it, though one wishes for a little more variety of metre and rhyme in so long a poem. I think it is a very youthful one - I hope so, for the emotional attitude is distinctly immature. I have also begun D. Gray! and have done a little to my [unclear] knit [/unclear] - which I like more and more.
      My darling, I love you, I miss you so much and long to see you again. I hope all goes well with you and you have either got some money or manage to negotiate a loan. By the way don't forget to write to Miss Fawell about that N. G. Lecture and don't forget to get some work from Gainsborough. I see AD. B. S did an article on [unclear] Hetism [/unclear] and Buffet in A.S & R.
      I love you, dearest Poet,
      I love you,
      Sylvia.
