    annotation_text: 23 11 1951  Dearest Sylvia  I am just finishing my notes for
      the Signorelli, &c., lecture which is due to start in about 15 minutes.  There
      is time to tell you the thought, the feeling (the two absolutely coincide),
      that I love you.  I adore you so much and wish that you were here.  Yesterday
      was not a strain really.  I met a psychiatrist (who employs Poises to instruct
      the mad in art) and I expect to meet him again, he is very intelligent and nice.  He
      pointed out Francis Bacon' single subject is castration fear.  I went to the
      R.B.A. exhibition and I cannot feel you have lost anything by missing the sending-in
      day.   Madeleine Pearson said (when I met her there) that it was not as good
      as last year.  She has two pictures in, but nothing looks nice in such dreary
      oppressive company.  Have you had an opportunity by now to work on tiny, the
      savage, or the Flight?  Do let me know of your work - this direction for they
      are so nearly finished.  I have got out of Banstead as you suggested by telling
      them that Wednesday to Saturday at the N.G. were too much & I bullied them (discreetly)
      into agreeing to a [unclear][/unclear] visit on the latter day.  My cat is the
      diplomatic power behind the throne as well as the warm, regal creature on the
      large cushion on the throne.  LATER The lecture is just over; Paul joined on
      to it and was very flattering about it.  I think it was a satisfactory one;
      it grew to about 70, large for a Friday afternoon.  (I detect symptoms of dissatisfaction
      with C J [unclear][/unclear] numerous people.)  Paul sends you his love - his
      best love, even beyond that of Jean Marais he says.  He has been busy with poems
      & pictures.  Look after yourself my precious rose, I love you Lawrence

      Dearest Sylvia,

      I am just finishing my notes for the Signarelli, & R., lecture which is due to start in about 15 minutes. There is time to tell you the thought, the feeling (the two absolutely coincide), that I love you. I adore you so much and wish that you were here.

      Yesterday was not a strain really. I met a psychiatrist (who employs [unclear]Painters[/unclear] who instruct the [unclear]mod[/unclear] in art) and I expect to meet him again, he is very intelligent and nice. He painted and Francis Bacon's single subject is castration fear.

      I went to the R.B.A. exhibition and I cannot feel you have lost anything by missing the sending-in day. Madelaine Pearson said (when I met her there) that it was not as good as last year. She has two pictures in, but nothing looks nice in such dreary [unclear]apprersive[/unclear] company.

      Have you had an opportunity by now to work on Tiny, the savage, or the Flight? Do let me know of your work in this direction for [unclear]thalore[/unclear] so nearly finished.

      I have got art of Barnstead as you suggested of telling them that Wednesday & Saturday at the N.G. were too much & I bullied them (discretely) into agreeing to [unclear]selling visit[/unclear] on [unclear]the latter[/unclear] day. My cat is the diplomative power behind the throne as well as the war, regal creature on the large cushion on the throne.

      LATER

      The lecture is just over; Paul joined on to it and was very flattering about it. I think it was a satisfactory one: it grew to about 70, large for a Friday afternoon. (I detect symptoms of dissatisfaction with C.J. [unclear]away[/unclear] numerous people.)

      Paul send you his love - his [unclear]hect[/unclear] love, even beyond that of Jean Marvis he says. He has been [unclear]busy[/unclear] with poems & pictures.

      Look after yourself my precious rose,
