      I hope the "Duchamps"
      lecture went well, or goes!
      Pett

      Dearest Lawrence,
      Thank you for your letter.  I hope your
      tea with Pasmore is amusing tomorrow.
      You seem to be becoming positively
      bosom.  Do you like him?  I
      have always imagined him to be very
      pompous and pontificating.  Certainly
      the way he treats his wife suggests it.
      I have mislaid your letter so I
      cannot really answer it.  I wrote
      off to George and John, I hope to
      go there on Friday next--then I
      will come to town and you on Saturday.
      I will let you know directly I hear.
      I do not know exactly what dates
      suit Aunt Margaret either; but I expect
      I may hear tomorrow or Monday.  I
      will also tell my father that I shall
      be in town.
      I'm so sorry to hear that your

      Pett    I hope the "Duchamp"         8.7.52
                  lecture went well-, or goes!

      Dearest Lawrence,
         Thank you for your letter -- I hope your
      tea with Passmore is amusing to-morrow.

      You seem to be becoming positively
      [unclear]Bosom[/unclear].  Do you like him?  I
      have always imagined him to be very
      pompous and pontificating.  Certainly
      the way he treats his wife suggests it.
         I have mislaid your letter so I
      cannot really answer it.  I wrote
      off to George and John, I hope to
      go there on Friday next -- then I
      will come to town and you on Saturday
      I will let you know directly I hear.
      I do not know exactly what dates
      suit aunt Margaret either; but I expect
      I may hear tomorrow or Monday. I
      will also tell my father that I shall
      be in town.
         I'm so sorry to hear that your
