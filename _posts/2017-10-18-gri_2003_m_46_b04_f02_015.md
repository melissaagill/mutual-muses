      Dearest Sylvia,
      I am writing this under the drier at Ted's. This is the first
      chance I've had to write today.  Thank you for your letters.
      I am glad you are working on the flight & I hope that your
      watercolor is, despite your qualms, satisfactory.  I
      hope that Ting did sit for you today.
      Tomorrow, when I come back from [unclear]clelmford[/unclear], I am
      spending the afternoon with [unclear]Iibell[/unclear] and the evening with [unclear]Made-lline[/unclear]
      & Marry [unclear]Pearson[/unclear]. [unclear]Iibell[/unclear] wants me to go to a dance
      on Friday but I am not sure I want to.  The matter is
      left open until tomorrow afternoon.  I hope to find out
      all about [unclear]hermetir[/unclear] surrealism from her at any rate.
      My BBC appointment is in London at 3.30.  May I re-
      mind you that the 2 exhibitions at the R. A, end on the 7th,
      that is Wednesday.
      I dream of you my [unclear]marvelous[/unclear] love.  How I adore you.
      I hope to see you early next week even if only for a few
      days.  Longer if I get a cheque.  I love you my wonderful
      [unclear]muse[/unclear], my painter, my lover.

      I love you,
      I love you
      Lawrence
