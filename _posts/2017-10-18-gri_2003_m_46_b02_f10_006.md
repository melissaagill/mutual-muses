      22 xi 1949

      Dearest Sylvia,

      I am delighted with the news of your lectures contained in today's letter. Congratulations, my dear Minerva. Your audience seems to be admirable. You seem to have enjoyed it very much: that is a good thing - I knew that  your nervousness would vanish with a little practice. Now I look forward to hearing one for myself. How kind o f you to arrange the syllabus with an eye on a lion.  Clifford and Marjorie and I talked about you in the afternoon Marjorie told me what you would be doing at exactly what time: 'now, at four, she will be going to the bus', and so on. I thought about you very hard and lovingly.

      I enjoyed yesterday very much indeed. We went to the Kensington Gallery first and we enjoyed both your pictures and the pleasant context in which they are to be seen. How very good they are! Then we went to the Arcade Gallery and again you can imagine the thoughts of you that were in my mind as we looked at the 'fantastic and bizarre' pictures. One of the pieces, Juno and Minerva surrounded by Symbols by Rottenhammer suggested a poem I have just written, with the substitution of Apollo for Juno.  I liked very much the Genoese triptych.

      The sex talk was admirable: nothing new I think to Clifford but the survey of the pronouncements on sex by early Christians interested me greatly in its disgusting manner. The lecturer's opinions about sex and rationalism were irreproachable and he thoroughly denouced every aspect of religious influence on our society.

      Do give Clifford and Marjorie my love and tell them how much I enjoyed my day.

      Blackheath
      22 xi 1949

      Dearest Sylvia,

      I am delighted with the news of your lecture con-
      tained in today's letter. Congratulations, my dear
      Minerva. Your audience seems to be admirable. You
      seem to have enjoyed it very much: that is a good
      thing - I knew that your nervousness would vanish with
      a little practice. How I look forward to hearing one
      for myself. How kind of you to arrange the syllabus
      with an eye on a lion. Clifford and Marjorie and I
      talked about you and in the afternoon Marjorie told
      me what you would be doing at exactly what time: 'now,
      at four, she will be going to the bus', and so on. I
      thought about you very hard and lovingly.

      I enjoyed yesterday very much indeed. We went
      to the Kensington Gallery first and we enjoyed both
      your pictures and the pleasant context in which they
      are to be seen. How very good they are! Then we
      went to the Arcade Gallery and again you can imagine
      the thoughts of you that were in my mind as we looked
      at the 'fantastic and bizarre' pictures. One of the
      pieces, Juno and Minerva surrounded by Symbols by Rot-
      tenhammer suggested a poem I have just written, with
      the substitution of Apollo for Juno. I liked very
      much the Genoese triptych.

      The sex talk was admirable: nothing new I think
      to Clifford but the survey of the pronouncements on
      sex by early Christians interested me greatly in its
      disgusting manner. The lecturer's opinions about sex and ration-
      alism were irreproachable and he thoroughly denounced
      every aspect of religious influence on our society.

      Do give Clifford and Marjorie my love and tell them how much I enjoyed my day.
