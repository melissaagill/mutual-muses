      add up to a single point and the implication is that any of the
      objects in the office might be traced through a total net-
      work of encounters, failures, violence, pleasure. In that sense
      the film depends on giving us a sense of the city with all its
      inhabitants - the complex simulaneity and, at the same time, dis-
      parate existence of people. That is implicit in the device-for-
      continuity but the stories are too neatly packaged up in half-
      hour sections labelled bitter-sweet, regional-humorous, and so on.
      In Le Plaisir (1952) the divice-for-continuity is again mag-
      ical and irrational. The commentator is Guy de Maupassant him-
      self, terribly cute and French, speaking from hades or wherever.
      The identity of author and story is cemented here, denying the
      distance and autonomy which the novelist can enjoy. The mechan-
      istic story is beautifully exposed by these devises-for-contin-
      uity which do not betray the original authors but do them
      real justice. The three episodes deal with sexual pleasure from
      a moral standpoint: in the first we encounter a few puppets 'un-
      der the shadow of pleasure'; in the third a couple are bitterly
      linked, paying for their early pleasure; in the second the point
      is, I supposed, in this context, that Rivet does not copulate with
      Rosa despite the flowers and the fine weather. The commentator
      is the point-of-view underlying the stories: the author is his
      own form. The writer with a God-complex is superbly in the know
      and his comments are designed to make us marvel, chuckle, shud-
      der at the bag-of-tricks which is life. Destiny as the gimmick.

      add up to a single point and the implication is that any of the
      objects in the office might be traced back through a total net-
      work of encounters, failures, violence, pleasure. In that sense
      the film depends on giving us a sense of the city with all its
      inhabitants - the complex simultaneity and, at the same time, dis-
      parate existence of people. That is implicit in the device-for-
      continuity but the stories are too nearly packages up in half-
      hour sections labelled bitter-sweet, regional-humorous, and so on.
           In Le Plaisir (1952) the device-for-continuity is again mag-
      ical and irrational. The commentator is Guy de Maupassant him-
      self, terribly cute and French, speaking from hades or wherever.
      The identity of author and story is cemented here, denying the
      distance and autonomy which the novelist can enjoy. The mechan-
      istic story is beautifully exposed by these devices-for-contin-
      uity which do not betray the original authors but do them
      real justice. The three episodes deal with sexual pleasure from
      a moral standpoint: in the first we encounter a few puppets 'un-
      der the shadow of pleasure'; in the third a couple are bitterly
      linked, paying for their early pleasure; in the second the point
      is, I suppose, in this context, that Rivet does not copulate with
      Rosa despite the flowers and the fine weather. The commentator
      is the point-of-view underlying the stories: the author is his
      own form. The writer with a God-complex is superbly in the know
      and his comments are designed to make us marvel, chuckle, shud-
      der at the bag-of-tricks which is life. Destiny as the gimmick.
