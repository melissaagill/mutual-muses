      Dearest Lawrence  I hope that your lectures went well yesterday - and you were not too tired when you returned from Petersfield - I am glad that you will be staying at Wimbledon to-night as that will mean that you will not be so late.  I was so sorry not to come to your lecture But I think you were right in advising me to come here.  [unclear]Traveling wily/oh[/unclear] was pleasant and I didn't think of my health.  I'm so sorry that Magda is not well - They are like the lovers Cocteau's "Love Eternal"! but I hope they'll be more fortunate.  John said had I seen Stella Stein's work - he thought it superb - I think Ihave the adjective right!  He said that you didn't think very highly of it.  He gave me some very useful hints about priming and treating old cavases.

    clean_transcription: Ditchling 12.3.52<br/>Dearest Lawrence<br/>I hope that your
      lectures went well<br/>yesterday- and you were not too tired<br/>when you returned
      to Petersfield. I <br/>am glad that you will be staying at<br/>Wimbledon to-night
      as that will mean<br/>that you will not be so late. I was<br/>so sorry not to
      come to your lecture<br/>But I think you were right in advising<br/>me to come
      here. Travelling with John<br/>was pleasant and I didn't think of my<br/>health.
      I'm so sorry that Magda is not<br/>well. They are like the lovers in Cocteau's<br/>"Love
      Eternal"! but I hope they'll be<br/>more fortunate. John said had I seen<br/>Stella
      Stein's work - he thought it superb -<br/>I think I have the adjective right!
      He<br/>said that you didn't think very highly<br/>of it. He gave me some very
      useful<br/>hints about priming and treating old<br/>canvases.
