      Pett  19-3-52

      Dearest Lawrence,
      I have bought a new pen-holder
      from Mrs. Mercer when I want to buy
      some more seeds. I have put in it the
      pen you gave me.  It is a great relief!
      My next social activity is to judge
      a competition of "pull on" hats for the
      WI on Friday--as a special favour to
      the Miss Hutchinsons--who are now extremely
      friendly.  On the evening I go round to the
      Savages--they seem to like me--and I
      begin to feel sentimental about them!
      I have still the finishing touches to
      do for my still life with cupid.  I
      shall call it "still-life" in the Dining
      Room", for today I worked on my
      still life of Clifford's sunderland jugs.
      With my cup upturned.  I have drawn
      it in very carefully with terre vert and
      started the background, the mirror
      frame and the reflection of the landscape,
      which I think makes a more charming
      picture than the reflection of my cardigan!
      Clifford is delighted that I should be
      painting his jugs and it most interested.
