      Dearest Lawrence,
      Tomorrow is New Year's
      Eve and I do wish you a very
      happy New Year, and that I
      could be with you--I love you
      so much.
      I will enclose the NPG
      acquisitions.  I see in A. News
      that they are having an exhibition
      of their new acquisitions.  Also that
      Foldes is having another show
      at the Red Fern.
      I have had a very frustrating
      and maddening day, apart
      from a lovely dinner this evening
      and a pleasant evening with the
      woods, and in magnificent
      sermon by Clifford this morning.
      For I have been trying to cut
      down a frame for my picture
      of the "Will"--with fairly
      disastrous results--Clifford
      has very kindly offered to try
      to put it right for me.
