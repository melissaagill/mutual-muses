Also I visited an exhibition of the Treasures of Italian libraries, ill. MSS & drawings & tapestries from C 4a to C 16 a.  This I must see again because it contains much that is new to me.

This afternoon I shall see the exhibition at the Petit Palais of the virgin in French art - an upleasant theme but one which is sure to comprise many fine works.  You will see I am taking my time quite seriously.
