      My dearest Sylvia,

      Thank you very much for your letter which contains good news of two new paintings and adorable, previous words of love.
      Yesterday morning I had a walk round the city of Bath and in the afternoon we all went to Castle Combe which can only be described as a beauty spot.  The choice was not mind but it is picturesque & full of friendly tortoise-shell cats.

      Today we are due for a walk on the dams above Bath and, perhaps, tomorrow I may go to Bristol: thus, I shall return to the hub of the empire on Wednesday.
