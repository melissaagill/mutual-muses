      I have signed and sent the agreement to Chase - I hope you will have an opportunity to discuss the hanging with him. M. is very willing to do it if it doesn't upset Chase.
      I think you are probably right to lecture at Banstead on the 21st though I hate to miss a day of you. I am delighted that you can stay until the end of the month - we are all saving up drinks for you!
      I love you and long to see you. I love you
