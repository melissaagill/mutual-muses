      21 iii 1951 Dearest Sylvia,
      I enclose a drawing by Paul dedi-
      cated to you: it is an example of
      what can only be called 'entoptic
      graphomania'. With it is a poem from
      Dandy: various latinate words &
      altitudes are combined in an Anglo-
      Saxon type of line structure. I showed
      like to master every poetic form
      and put them in the service of your
      beauty.
      In a few moments I am going to
      town with the paintings for the WIAC.
      I wish you luck, my dearest cat.
      Thank you for the postal order.
      Then, after going to Herbert Reises
