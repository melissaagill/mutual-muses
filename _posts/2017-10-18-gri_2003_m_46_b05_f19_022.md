      Hastings Station 11.7.52
      Dearest Lawrence,
      I am waiting for [unclear]Saint Charles[/unclear] train.
      I wish you were coming - I remember last time I was here how elegantly you leapt from the train, and how charmingly you smiled to see me!
      I have just got 2 emergency coupons - 1 for Hetty and one for Aunt Margaret - I thought that the most convenient thing to do. I am sorry but not surprised that you can't come to Bath, for I know you are busiest when people are on holiday. I just thought it might be possible. One bright spot - I shall be able to stay a day or two on my way home. If that will suit you.
      Thursday Pett

         I am waiting for [unclear]Mrs/Sue[/unclear] Clarke's train. I wish you were coming - I remember last time I was here how elegantly  you leapt from the train, and how charm-ingly you smiled to see me!
         I have just got 2 emergency coupons - 1 for Hetty and one for Aunt Margaret - I thought that the most convenient thing to do.  I am sorry but not surprised that you can't come to Bath, for i know you are busiest when people ar on holiday. I just though it might be possible. One bright spot - I shall be able to stay a day or two on my way home if that will suit you.

      Tuesday Pett
      I'm so sorry not to have finished this yesterday - but as I expect you will guess I have been rather rushed.
