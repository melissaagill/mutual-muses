      4. you reading to  me!
      I have quite enjoyed my day though - I worked in the garden most of the afternoon - in the Rose-garden - which is gradually yielding to my law! I am at present working on a very wild bit full of stony coarse grass. I found some more figs too. Yesterday M and I  went Blackberrying for the second time, we now have half a crock full - I feared I might have to fill it alone which takes so long - but there is a better crop this year so it will not be such hard work - and I think of the delicious wine it makes. I saw some honeysuckle still in flower and thought of you, my love. One spray and gleaming red transparent berries as well as flowers showing the slipping  of summer into autumn.

    annotation_text: '4 your reading to me!! I have quite enjoyed my day though. I
      worked in the garden most of the afternoon- in the rose garden- which is gradually
      yielding to my law!! I am at present working on a very wild bit full of strong
      course grass.  I found some more figs too. Yesterday M. and I haven''t black
      berrying for the second time. We now have half a crock full. I teased I might
      have to fill it alone which takes so long, but there is a better crop this year
      so it will be such hard work, and I think of the delicious wine it makes. I
      saw some honeysuckle still in flower and thought of you, my love. One [unclear]spray[/unclear]
      and gleaming red transparent berries as well as flowers showing the slipping
      of summer into autumn. '
