      The cliffs and complicated groynes
      The slanted shore, the shells
      (I have their doubles here)
      Are doppelgangers your brush
      Records its double function
      To please and to possess

      Yes, my darling, please do do the Dutch Interiors and Genre scenes.   We shall soon be quite rich if we go on working like this.

      By the way, Castleford, appears to be in Yorkshire, near Leeds but I think if we went there now and the on to Scotland it would rather deplete again the money I hope to build up.   If we go next year - when the engagement is longer than a week -  we should be able to have the trip more conveniently, I think. I looked Redcar up on the map and it is over two-thirds of the way to Edinbrugh.

      I really feel rather tired.   After breakfast I went back to bed an slept for a while. It is lunch time and I must do some work.   Before I feel asleep, however. I read and amusing 18th century version of a Moliere play called 'The Cit Turned Gentleman' (part of the Hogarth background). Can you guess wich play of MOliere' s it is that is thus entitled in English?

      My parents gave me milk-chocolate, butter, and ham from France.   I have the decanter and the two plates. Mother is resisting about the trays but I am sure of the small one.   The decanter looks very well now it's washed.  You were, of course, right.

      I will write agan soon.   I love you, Sylvia Lawrence,

      the engagement is longer than a week - we should be able to have  the trip more
      conveniently, I think. I looked Redcar up on the map and it is over two-thirds
      of the way to Edinburgh.  I feel rathe tired. After breakfast I went back to
      bet and slept for a while. It is lunch time and I must do some work. Before
      I fell asleep, however , I read na amusing 18th century version of a Moliere
      play called 'The Cit Turned Gentleman' (part of Hogarth background). Can you
      guess which play of Moliere's it is that is thus entitled in English? My parents
      gave me milk-chocolate, butter, and ham from France. I have the decanter and
      the two plates. Mother is resisting about the trays but I am sure of the small
      one. The decanter looks very well now it's washed. You were, of course, right.
      I will write again soon. I love you, Sylvia,  Lawrence
