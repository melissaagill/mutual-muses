      Rectory Lodge  25 6.52
      Dearest Lawrence,
          Thank you for your two letters
      and news. Clifford wants to know
      who the psychologist is! We thought
      about you continuously yesterday
      and wondered how you were getting on
      and when your interview was. I wonder
      how you are getting on to-day - I
      imagine you will have had your
      interview by now and perhaps be
      on your way back -its 1.30
      now- I suppose if you are success
      full you will be appointed at
      once- in which case I expect you
      is on the short list - youth is on
      your side here I think as [unclear][/unclear]
      in young.
        I have mislaid your letter

      you for your two letters and news. Clifford wants to know who the psychologist
      is! We thought about you continuously yesterday and wondered how you were getting
      on and when your interview was. I wonder how you are getting on to-day. I imagine
      you will have had your interview by now and perhaps be on your way back. It's
      1.30 now. I suppose if you are successful you will be appointed at once-in which
      case I expect you will wire me! I wonder who else is on the short list. Youth
      is on your side here I think as  is young.<br/>I have mislaid your letter
