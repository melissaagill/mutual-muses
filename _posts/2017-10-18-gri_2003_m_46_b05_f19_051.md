      [unclear][/unclear] from: -
      c/o Mrs Hicks of Hermitage Road Lansdown Bath

      Dearest Lawrence,

      How sweet it was of you to see one off and look after me so kindly - it made even travelling a pleasure - but of course I wished you had been with me, and much disliked to glide away from you my darling.

      In my "exit anxiety" I forgot to look with you at the ring - perhaps you could look and let me know? It is in an otherwise almost empty ring-case of "Whistler and Co" on the extreme left about the middle shelf of the left window. Do enquire.

      I had, thanks mainly to you - a very comfortable journey and the train arrived 10 minutes early! Audrey met me and has been extremely nice, friendly and affectionate so it should be a most pleasant visit. We had tea in the garden with an old friend of Aunt Margaret's

      Lawrence,<br/>   How sweet it was of you to<br/>see me off and look after me<br/>so
      kindly -- it made even traveling<br/>a pleasure -- but of course I wished<br/>you
      had been with me, and much<br/>disliked to glide away from you<br/>my darling-<br/>   In
      my "exit anxiety" I forgot<br/>to look with you at the ring -- perhaps<br/>you
      could look and let me know?<br/>It is in an otherwise almost empty<br/>ring-case
      of "Whisten and Co" on<br/>the extreme left about the middle<br/>shelf of the
      left window.  Do enquire<br/>   I had , thanks mainly to you -- a <br/>very
      comfortable journey and the train<br/>arrived 10 minutes early!  Audrey<br/>met
      me and has been extremely nice<br/>friendly and affectionate so it should<br/>be
      a most pleasant visit  We had<br/>tea in the garden with and old<br/>friend
      of Aunt Margaret''s'
