      is nice you will enjoy being at Pett, perhaps.
      How are the Woods? I hope you find them in
      a pleasant state. While you are there you
      will be able to interview the models and
      make a start on them - on one of them, I mean -
      for VENUS.

      I could not sleep until 'the small hours'
      last night, but then I slept well. My tooth-
      ache is not at all bad and my glands are
      a little down. I am hoping to see Mother's
      dentist - otherwise I shall ring up the
      Blackheath people one by one. There is my
      report. How are you? Tell me.

      I must shave and dress for Oddenino's.
      Otherwise I shall be terribly late. Hetty
      is excited to be going there.
      Love, love, love
      I love you
      Lawrence

      a little down.  I am hoping to see Mother's
      dentist--otherwise I shall ring up the
      Blackheath people one by one.  There is my
      report.  How are you?  Tell me.
      I must shave and dress for Oddenino's.
      Otherwise I shall be terribly late.  Hetty
      is excited to be going there.
      Love, love, love
      I love you
      Lawrence

      the Woods?  I hope you find them in<br/>a pleasant state.  While you are there
      you<br/>will be able to interview the models and<br/>make a start on them--on
      one of tem, I mean<br/>for VENUS.<br/>I could not sleep until 'the small hours'<br/>last
