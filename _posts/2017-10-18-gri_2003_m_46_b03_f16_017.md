      tucked in my belt to inspire me.
           I cannot bring myself to paint the view from the Bathroom, but wish to paint from the bedroom window, with Tiny's italian china on the sill. I hope to start this to-morrow.
           The weather is still very changeable and difficult but fruits and vegetables prosper beautifully -- I find great joy in a good harvest of this kind. I wish you were here with me, we could be so happy.
           Mrs. Savage is very pleased with the portrait and will, I think, buy it. I have very little more to do.
           I have no more news, except how much I love you -- my splendid poet, my prince.
           Tiny sends her love and thanks you very much for your nice letter.
                          I love you
