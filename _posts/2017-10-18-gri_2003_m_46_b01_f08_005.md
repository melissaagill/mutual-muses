      Dearest Sylvia
      I am desolate that you should be unhappy, darling. Desolate, too, that [unclear]ICaly[/unclear] has not, as we mainly hoped, made any difference [unclear]a tee[/unclear] situation. Michael seems orientated toward his own and your unhappiness. How your letter wrung my heart - "anxiety imprisons [unclear]lone[/unclear]", I feel quite desperate. IC seems Michael will always be there to threaten with reprisals [unclear] our[/unclear] pleasures together. I fear, for you, what he will do, on your return, after the 10th.  Ought I, I wonder, to be willing to drop the arrangement in view of your subsequent suffering? If you beleive it is necessary tell me and I shall understand - though I hope of course that you will come on the 10th - I hope more than I can say. Do let me know soon, one way or the other, or I fear I shall be unable to find accommodation if your answer is a delirious, to me, yes.

      Thank you for the time-table. (Perhaps I will come to Tumbridge by bus.) Do you need the time-table back for your own movements? [unclear]I[/unclear] ) so tell me and I'll copy times down.

      I am happy about your work in oils and delighted that you are going to start adding to your [unclear] Georgione[/unclear] which is already considerable. I will look up the full details of the Titian today and send you what information I find. What about the books? Surely you will have to come to the V and A for them or does the Hastings reference library have unsuspected reserves? The symbolism of Adonis and Ceres sounds fascinating.

      IC is working that Michael may have a return to the [unclear]Salberg[/unclear]. I suppose he is ambivalent about it. As you can suppose - so am I. Michael is trying to make our love impossible. As you in the past have warned me against people so I must against Michael. Do please be on guard - despite the pressing necessity ti soothe, pleasure, reassure him, do not slacken your resistance to his attack on you and I.

      3.IX.1948
      Dearest Sylvia
      I am desolate that you should be unhappy, darling. Desolate,
      too, that Italy has not, as we naively hoped, made any difference
      in the situation. Michael seems orientated toward his own and your
      unhappiness. How your letter wrung my heart - "anxiety imprisons love",
      I feel quite desperate. It seems Michael will always be there to threat-
      en with reprisals our pleasures together. I fear, for you, what he
      will do, on your return, after the 10th. Ought I, I wonder, to be
      willing to drop the arrangement in view of your subsequent suffering?
      If you believe it is necessary tell me and I shall understand - though
      I hope of course that you will come on the 10th - I hope more than I can
      say. Do let me know soon, one way or the other, as I fear I shall be
      unable to find accommodation if your answer is a delicious, to me, yes.

      Thank you for the time-table. (Perhaps I will come to Tonbridge
      by bus.) Do you need the time-table back for your own movements? If
      so, tell me and I'll copy times down.

      I am happy about your work in oils and delighted that you are
      going to start adding to your Giorgione which is already con-
      siderable. I will look up the full details of the Titian today and send
      you what information I find. What about the books? Surely you will
      have to come to the V and A for them or does the Hastings reference library
      have unsuspected reserves? The symbolism of Adonis and Ceres sounds
      fascinating.

      It is shocking that Michael may have G return to the gallery.
      I suppose he is ambivalent about it. As you can suppose - so am I.
      Michael is trying to make our love impossible. As you in the past
      have warned me against people so I must against Michael. Do
      please be on guard - despite the pressing necessity to soothe, pleasure,
      reassure him, do not slacken your resistance to his attack on
      you and I.

      I am desolate that you could be unhappy, darling. Desolate too, that Italy has not, as we naively hoped, made any difference to the situation. Michael seems [unclear]orientated[/unclear] towards his own and yours unhappiness. How your letter wrung my heart -"anxiety [unclear]imprisons[/unclear] love". I feel quite desperate. It seems Michael will always be there to threaten with reprisals our pleasures together. I fear, for you, what he will do, on your return, after the 10th. Ought I, I wonder to be willing to drop the arrangement in view of your subsequent suffering? If you believe it is necessary tell me and I shall understand - though I hope of course that you will come on the 10th - I hope more than I can say. Do let me know soon, one way or the other, as I fear I shall be unable to find accomodation if your answer is a [unclear]delirious[/unclear], to me, yes.
      Thank you for the time-table. (Perhaps I will come to Tonbridge by bus.) Do you need the time-table back for your own movements? If so, tell me and I'll copy times down. I am happy about your work in oils and delighted that you are going to start adding to your[unclear]Morgione[/unclear] which is already considerable. I will look up the full details of the Titian today and send you what information I find. What about the books? Surely you will have to come the V and A for them or does the [unclear]Maslings[/unclear] Reference library have unexpected reserves? The symbolism of Adonis and Ceres sounds fascinating.
      It is shocking that Michael may have to return to the gallery. I suppose he is ambivalent about it. As you can suppose - so am I. Michael is trying to make our love impossible. As you in the past have warned me about people so I must against Michael. Do please be on guard - despite the pressing necessity to soothe, pleasure, reassure him, do not slacken your resistance to his attack on you and I.
      Let us hope that Ditchley will be enjoyable. I remember accounts of fabulous banquets, like Marco Polo you were after one visit returning to an incredulous admiring [unclear]Danydlion[/unclear]audience, and I hope  they [unclear]obtain[/unclear] again
