      11.2.53
      Dearest Lawrence,
      Still no cards from chase - I hope I may get some before long. If you should ring up please ask for 500 - that includes yours - how many do you want? I enclose a card to put with a card to the editor of the Architectural Review. I will also enclose an envelope for Mr Smith as you don't tell me his number. How many stamps shall I send you? I hope you have the [unclear]Blacken [/unclear]safely - please do let me know the size of "Tiny Tots" as soon as possible. will you send a card to Paul Southey as I haven't his address - you don't say if you agree with me about sending a card to Paul Harding. I think with his increasing experience in the business well Paul will probably do very well soon. I hope so, he's certainly very versatile.
      You will be glad to hear I am much better - though I seem hardly able to sleep at all and spend my nights in an agony of worry and unhappiness -

      to The Editor of the Architectural Review.
      I will also enclose an envelope for Mr
      Smith as you don't tell me his number.
      How many stamps shall I send you?
      I hope you have the Blacker safely -
      please do let me know the size of "Tiny
      Tots" as soon as possible. With you
      send a card to Paul Southey as I haven't
      his address - you don't say if you agree
      with me about sending a card to Paul
      Harding. I think with his increasing experience
      in the business , well Paul will probably do
      very well soon. I hope so, he's certainly
      very versitile.

      You will be glad to hear I am much
      better - Though I seem hardly able
      to sleep at all and spend my nights in
      an agony of worry and unhappiness -
