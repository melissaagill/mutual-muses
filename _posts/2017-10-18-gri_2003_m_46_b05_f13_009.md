      Dearest Lawrence,
      Here is a cutting of "Belle
      and Bete" also a cutting of
      the new NPG acquistions.
      The play of "Bacchus" by Cocteau
      is set in Germany in 1520 in
      a little court of the Rhineland,
      and the curtain rises to reveal
      an actor who explains that
      it was the custom of the
      place to choose, every 5 years
      someone from the village to
      Bay Bacchus, who for 8 days
      has unlimited power.  The
      last Bacchus had been the Duke's
      son, who at the end of his
      term of office committed suicide
      because the return to reality
      seemed to him impossible--
      At the time of the opening of the
      play Christine, the young and
      loveable daughter of the Duke
      has chosen, Hans to be Bacchus

      8-1-52 Pett Dearest Lawrence,
      Here is a cutting of "Belle
      and Bete", also a cutting of
      the new N.P.G. Acquisitions.
      The play of "Bacchus" by Cocteau
      is set in Germany in 1520, in
      a little court of the Rhineland,
      and the curtain rises to reveal
      an actor who explains that
      it was the custom of the
      place to choose, every 5 years,
      someone from the village to
      Bay Bacchus, who for 8 days
      has unlimited power. The
      last Bacchus had been the Duke's
      son, who the end of his
      term of office committed suicide
      because the return to reality
      seemed to him impossible -
      At the time of the opening of the play,
      Christine, the young and
      loveable daughter of the Duke
      has chosen, Hans to be Bacchus
