      My dearest Sylvia:
      Let me, at once, wish you a happy
      birthday.  Properly I should be
      there in person with good wishes--and
      with gifts.  The good [unclear][/unclear] I must
      convey with words in this lette.r  The
      gifts are not available on the right
      day.  Forgive me, I have simply not
      been able to come enough for your
      present.  I shall give you a gift
      in the nearest possible future.
      My muse has not come harmoniously
      to my aid, despite appealse.  There-
      fore I must shape my wishes accord-
      ingly.  I wish you faint and good
      things according to your drawing for
      receipts in Britania and Eve, and
      peace and comfort such as your crad-
      le deceiving expresses.  To this I
      would add the un-Britania & Eve
      feeling of my love for you, dearest
      birthday cat.
