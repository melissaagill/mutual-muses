      Dearest Lawrence
      Thank you for your letter and for sending the [unclear]teas[/unclear]. I'm sorry to be such a nuisance. Thank you too for the vignette of Dandy--I fully appreciate the [unclear]Gilpimian Flavorne[/unclear]! By the way, have you had time to do any more of your Cubist article?

      I am delighted to hear of your two poems and Paul Southey's appreciation of them. I like the titles very well.

      Time has not yet had PMLA. I will tell you when it comes.

      You will be glad to hear that a 10 month old kitten has climbed the [unclear]letter[/unclear] now in 3 days--solo--but it couldn't climb down--(back legs wrong you know). It was assisted by a guide--and is now in the "bunk"!

      I hope to work on the Savage portrait this afternoon. They are dining with me to-morrow.
