      tled at 36 I am sure you will be very productive
      once again.

      I am really catching up on my sleep - at last: I
      slept until 12.30 yesterday and until 10.45
      today. I needed it. I am not trying to do any
      work at all today or tomorrow (and I spent yes-
      terday with the Cordells - absolutely idle). Har -penden tonight, of course - and I may go to
      the Mackintosh exhibition late this after-
      noon, if I feel like it. (I am reading some
      science-fiction, too, which is pleasant after the
      driving work of the last few weeks. I can even
      read Aunt Doe's New Yorkers now.)

      Hasn't the weather been nice? Today is like - well,
      like a mild afternoon in early December.

      I've got Ernst Kris' Psychoanalytic Explorations in
      Art to review for Art News & Review. It looks abso-
      lutely brilliant. (He even discusses [unclear]Empren's[/unclear] 7
      Types of Ambiguity: which makes Kris more hip
      than is usual among the doctors.)

      Well - lion plans to have a long, langerous bath
      now (see over leaf). I love you so much, dear-
      est love, I love you - you are my life.

      love you
      Lawrence
