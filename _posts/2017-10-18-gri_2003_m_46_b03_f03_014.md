      afternoon
      The letures are over and it is 4.30. I went to the Redfern
      to meet [unclear]Gainsborough[/unclear] and discovered it was an opening
      day & [unclear]learnt[/unclear] Madaleine Pearson was there so I was imme-
      diately introduced to numerous people. Slightly
      dazzled I am now having a cup of tea. The [unclear]situation[/unclear], by
      the way, was awful. The lectures were to boys
      - some of them in great [unclear]spin ties[/unclear] (2 1/2 on 3 inch [unclear]brats[/unclear]) &
      [unclear]slacks[/unclear] that were quite camp. But I manages to get
      them interested by giving them [unclear]sadistic[/unclear] pictures. The
      landscape with a serpent was a rare success.
      Tiny, I think, [unclear]slaved over[/unclear] an important modific-
      ation of current usage. The be really fashionable
      now one should use 'full' for every [unclear]empathic dis-
      gorgement[/unclear]. For example, [unclear]describing[/unclear] someone whom
      one formerly called a square: he should now be
      a full square, or, better still, the full [unclear]drear (drear[/unclear] is
      ousting square nowadays). Be sure to tell Tiny this
      new development. [EG. the full [unclear]bottom[/unclear], the full end, &c]
      I'm going to Paul's [unclear]gent[/unclear] this evening and I hope
      to arrange a sitting.
      I adore you my deares, my [unclear]namesly[/unclear] creature -
      Think of me, as I think you, lovingly, [unclear]constantly[/unclear]
      I love you,

      I went to the Redfern to meet Gainsborough and discovered it was an opening
      day and that Madeleine Pearson was there so I was immediately introduced to
      numerous people. Slightly dazzled I am now having a cup of tea. The exhibition,
      by the way, was awful. The lectures were to boys - some of them in great spiv
      ties (2 1/2 or 3 inch knots) & shoes that were quite camp. But I managed to
      get them interested by giving them sadistic pictures. The landscape with a serpent
      was a rare success.<br/><br/>Tiny, I think, should know an important modification
      of current usage. To be really fashionable now one should use ''full'' for every
      emphatic disparagement. For example, describing someone whom one formerly called
      a square: he should now be a full square, or, better still, the full drear (drear
      is ousting square nowadays). Be sure to tell Tiny this new development. [EG
      - the full bottom, the full end, & c]<br/><br/>I''m going to Paul''s flat this
      evening and I hope to arrange a sitting.<br/><br/>I adore you my dearest, my
      ravishing creature - Think of me, as I think of you, lovingly, constantly<br/><br/>I
      love you<br/><br/>Lawrence'
