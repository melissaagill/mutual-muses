      Dearest Lawrence,
       I adore the picture of "Lion at work in Garden".  It's a masterpiece.  The richness of the background and the admirable management of the back legs ! Sweet !  I am longing for you to come.

      The girl next to me in the bus turned out to be quite nice - a constant visitor to Paris - a great admirer of Fontainbleau and wants to go to Italy - so the 2nd half of the journey we had quite a nice talk.  I finished "George" and took a few notes yesterday.  Clifford sat for me for just over an hour and I am pleased with the head now  and I worked a further 1 1/2  on the background.

      I am so glad of all your news

      Dearest Lawrence,
          I adore the picture of "Lion at work in Garden". It's a masterpiece. The richness of the background and the admirable management of the back legs! Sweet! I am longing for you to come.
         The girl next to me in the 'bus turned out to be quite nice - a constant visitor to Paris - a great admirer of Fountainbleau and wants to go to Italy - so the 2nd half of the journey we had quite a nice talk. I finished "George" and took a few notes yesterday. Clifford sat for me for just over an hour and I am pleased with the head now. and I worked a [unclear]feather[/unclear] 1 1/2 on the background.
         I'm so glad of all your news
