      2 as I type it making any necessary
      corrections - Talking of corrections,
      I gave Clifford your film article to
      read - and he liked it very much -
      He made two corrections - one spelling
      cemetery with an 'e', and he thought
      "inpinges" would be better than "infringes".
      I shall very much look forward to
      reading what you say about Ophuls
      2 films - and the portmeantaurs!
      I wish I had some photoes of
      Dandy too - I think we will
      borrow the camera again in the summer and
      take lots of fancy ones of ourselves
      and Woods etc! I would like
      to have some records of the place -
      and the landscape in the snaps
      to charming I think.
      Thank you for your reassurence -
      I think you are right about the fiction!
      and course your love for me has
      rather upset their theories! By the
      way you mustn't say "Whatever" I
      do too but it is an illiteracy
      the Wood's say - Fowler says.
