      4 Klee's incisive diagrams and pointed captions in the Sketch-
      book express his dynamic world-view. he defines line as a
      point shifting its position and plane as the progression or
      a line. He develops this aesthetic of movement step by step
      through more complex formal elements. He applies categories
      of active, medial, and passive to a range of phenomena, such
      as the relationship of muscle and bone, to the blood stream,
      a waterfall, a plant. These categories are not fixed: for
      example, the waterfall is active because it turns the water-
      wheel but medial because it moves as it does owing to the active
      forces of gravity and obstructing mountain. By extension,
      the world can be defined as an endless series of manifold func-
      tions. Form, therefore, is the result of change and growth.

      The Pedagogical Sketchbook represents this aspect of Klee's
      thought brilliantly and it is, of course, a point of fundament-
      al importance in modern art. The Sketchbook is only a frag-
      ment, however: perhaps that is the reason for the disappoint-
      ment of the last section. Or, it may be that because, in the
      1920's, drawing was an important to Klee as painting, color lag-
      ged behind line in his formulae. Color has always been the
      most intractable element in aesthetics. From a colorist of
      Klee's genius it was legitimate to hope for more than a convent-
      ional circle of the spectrum. Not only is this a serious let-
      down after the preceeding original diagrams it is a contradiction
      of Klee's dynamic world-view. The color-wheel symbolises light

      Klee's incisive diagrams and pointed captions in the Sketchbook express dynamic world-view. He defines line as s point of shifting its position and plane as the progression of a line. He develops this aesthetic of movement step by step through more complex formal elements. He applies categories of active, medial, and passive to a range of phenomena, such as relationship of muscle and bone, to the blood stream, waterfall, a plant. These categories are not foxed; for example, the waterfall is active because it turns the waterwheel but medial because it moves as it does owing to the active forces of gravity and obstructing mountain. By extension, the world can be defined as an endless series of manifold functions. Form, therefore, is the result of change and growth.

      The Pedagogical Sketchbook represents this aspect of Klee's thought brilliantly and it is, of course, a point of fundamental importance in modern art. The Sketchbook is only a fragment, however: perhaps that is the reason for the disappointment of the last section. Or, it may be that because, in the 1920's, drawing was as important to Klee as painting, color lagged behind line in his formulae. Color has always been the most intractable element in aesthetics. From a colorist of Klee's genius it was legitimate to hope for more than a conventional circle of the spectrum. Not only is this a serious let-down after the preceding original diagrams it is a contradiction of Klee's dynamic world-view. The color-wheel symbolizes light
