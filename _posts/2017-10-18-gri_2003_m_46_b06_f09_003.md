      thus making an article about abstract
      art in the next [unclear][/unclear] one Art News.

      Before going home today I am having
      coffee at 6:00 with Roy Edwards who
      wrote that article on children in Sight
      & Sound. Tomorrow I am dining
      with Frank & Magda who returned
      last weekend. I'll tell you their
      news.

      I love you and am so glad that
      you will be in town again soon: it
      can't be too soon for me. I love you.

      I adore you
      Lawrence
