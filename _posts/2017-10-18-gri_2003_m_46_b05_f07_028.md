      I have been reading Thomas Mann's "Essay of 3 Decades", including a marvelous commentary on a version of "Amphitryion" by Kleist. I am tempted to write about this  myth myself-except, of course, M. Molehill has, so perhaps I should look for something else...
      Your railway bridge subject is very good. I have examined it since you left and my opinion of it is confirmed and raised. The tone seems very good to me, even in the unfinished foreground.
      The weather continues fine for you at Pett: I hope you can enjoy it even tho' it is not what you want for your garden.
      Do excuse pencil but you know what my [unclear][/unclear] is like at present...
      I love you, dearest Sylvia
      Adore you Lawrence
