      THE LANGUAGE

      Wit is finished but the words of hands
      Red from the sun and muddy from the farm
      Are signposts on a curving road that point
      Westwards to a place-name in the south.

      Weather-saws harry the future, imply
      Subterfuge and nuance in the present:
      Oracles and repetitions hide
      In sticky seaweed and the squatting cows.

      THE CLOUDS

      The birds do one thing, the air another:
      Stereotyped trees lean down the hills of wind
      And clouds betray the invisible air.

      Popular responses to the clouds
      Are old men above the attic, beards,
      Alps and maps, even symbolist nuages.

      Pillows for zephyrs and the displaced,
      Baroque curtains for martians, phenomena
      Related to the hot air and the cold.

      THE MARSHES

      Where fish hovered and weed rose
      Footpaths are almost lost in shit and grass.
      There are gates-at man-made intervals
      Along the Royal Military Canal.

      These rocks crowned with trees
      Were submarine:  the sea
      Is nearly half a mile away.
      Listen, it sighs through unseen shells of air.

      THE BEACH

      Now as the tide rolls up,
      The space I bathed in is revealed,
      Sleek sand and well-ground stones,
      Seaweed draped along the slant,
      And green stakes twisted in the air.

      I hung there off the ground
      Where now I hobble on pebbles.
      I look up from my feet, to surf,
      Then to the distant sliding sips
      In easy motion on the blurred horizon.

      THE LANGUAGE

      Wit is finished but the words of hands
      Red from the sun and muddy from the farm
      Are signposts on a curving road that point
      Westwards to a place-name in the south.

      Weather-saws harry the future, imply
      Subterfuge and nuance in the present:
      Oracles and repetitions hide
      In sticky seaweed and the squatting cows.

      THE CLOUDS

      The birds do one thing, the air another:
      Stereotyped trees lean down the hills of wind
      And clouds betray the invisible air.

      Popular responses to the clouds
      Are old men above the attic, beards,
      Alps and maps, even symbolist nuages.

      Pillows for zephyrs and the displaced,
      Baroque curtains for martians, phenomena
      Related to the hot air and the cold.

      THE MARSHES

      Where fish hovered and weed rose
      Footpaths are almost lost in shit and grass.
      There are gates at man-made intervals
      Along the Royal Military Canal.

      These rocks crowned with trees
      Were submarine: the sea
      Is nearly half a mile away.
      Listen, it signs through unseen shells of air.

      THE BEACH

      Now as the tide rolls up,
      The space I bathed in is revealed,
      Sleek sand and well-ground stones,
      Seaweed draped along the slant,
      And green stakes twisted in the air.

      I hung there off the ground
      Where now I hobble on pebbles.
      I look up from my feet, to surf,
      Then to this distant sliding ships
      In easy motion on the blurred horizon.
