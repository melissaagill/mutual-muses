      23 June
      Dearest Sylvia:
      Thank you for your letter and the prospectus of the Peron Orme hotel (what a curious name). I am looking forward very much indeed to our holiday, more than I can say. It is not too long to wait, either, I'm glad to say. How charming that you aunt is willing for me to come to: that is sweet of her.
      I shall not be able to catch the 1.30 train (that's when I must be  in court). If there is one between 4.00-6.00 I could catch that and reach Llandudno before midnight, anyway. Or would it be better to come as early as possible on Tuesday?
      I envy you a swim with Beryl. I hope that we can have some bathing at Llandudno
      I'm glad you read 'Farewell m my lovely': I think it is excellent. I agree with what you say about Marlowe's inviolability. (He's lucky to be.)
      Monday afternoon I had a very pleasant time with ELT Mesens & Robert Melville. I was (vainely) flattered by Mesens saying -
