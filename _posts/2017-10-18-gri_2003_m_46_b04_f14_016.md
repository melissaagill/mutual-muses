      Dearest Lawrence,
      I hope the weather is as nice with you as it is here; and that you have a pleasant journey - I have no doubt that your lecture will be most successful. I shall look forward to hearing about it.
      Tiny and I taking advantage of the weather did some more footpath surveying this afternoon from the Oak over the Glebe field to Panel Lane then back over the hill to the oak again.
      Let me know as soon as possible whether you are expecting me on Monday or Tuesday. I ththink it has better be Monday for sending the things in. Please could you send me an R.I. form for Michael - or should we send for one?

      I hope the weather is as nice
      with you as it is here; and that
      you have a pleasant journey.
      I have no doubt that your bet.
      We will be most successful.  I shall
      look forward to hearing about it.
      Tiny and I taking advantage of
      the weather did some nose
      footpath surveying this afternoon
      fromthe Oak over the Globe field to
      Pouch Lane then back over the hill
      to the oak again.
      Let me know as soon as
      possible whether you are expecting
      me on Monday or Tuesday.
      I think it had better be Monday
      for sending the things in.  Please

      Glebe field to Panch lane then back over the hill to the oak again.,<br/>     Let
      me know as soon as possible whether you are expecting me on Monday or Tuesday.  I
      think it had better by Monday for sending the things in.  Please could you send
      me an R.I. form for Michael - or should we send for one?
