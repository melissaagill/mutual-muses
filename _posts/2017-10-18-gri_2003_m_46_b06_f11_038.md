      Blackheath
      Monday
      Dearest Sylvia
      I am disappointed to say that Hal [unclear]Dauvatt[/unclear] has not yet reported to me about the house. If I do not hear from him today I will phone him up tomorrow morning. At least I can get a verbal summary from him that way.

      I feel very excited and in suspense, waiting to hear. I hope we get [unclear]Chepstow[/unclear] Road. I know we shall be happy together. At long last not being separated every few days or every few weeks. I can't wait. Oh I love you, dearest Sylvia.

      I haven't seen Monica so we have not talked about the house - obviously. I'll tell her when I see her we still know nothing definite.

      Yesterday's Jewish party at the TG had a collection for me & raised 30s. And can I use it! They want to come again on Sunday 20th Dec. I encouraged them to do so.

      It is still secret, but Pasmore may have a teaching job at Newcastle. That will leave me freer with the ICA show I should think. He didn't tell me. I heard it roundabout - so it may not be fixed yet.

      The weather here is very pleasant and mild. I hope it is so with you. If so it should be enchanting at Pett at this time of year. I feel sure you won't miss it too badly, my love, and you will still be able to visit it.

      Oh I love you so much.

      Adore you
      Lawrence

      I haven't seen Monica so we have not talked about the house. Obviously. I'll tell her when I see her we still know nothing definite.

      IC is still secret, but Parmera may have a teaching job at Newcastle. That will leave me free with the ICA [unclear]show[/unclear] I [unclear]slowed[/unclear] think. He didn't tel me. I heard it [unclear]somewhere[/unclear] - so it may not be fixed yet.

      Blackheath
      Monday 30-11-53
      Dearest Sylvia
      I am dissappointed that Danvatt has not yet reported to me about the house. If I do not hear from him today I will phone him up tomorrow morning. At least I can get a verbal summary from him that way.
      I feel very excited and in suspense, waiting to hear. I hope we get Clepstaw Road. I know we shall be happy together. At long last not being seperated every few days or even weeks. I can't wait. Oh I love you, dearest Sylvia.
      I haven't seen Monica so we have not talked about the house - obviously. I'll tell her when I see her we still know nothing definite.
      Yesterday's Jewish party at the TG had a collection for me & raised 30 pounds. And can I use it! They want to come again on Sunday 20th Dec.  I encourage them to do so.
      IC is still secret, but Pasmore may have a [unclear]teoding[/unclear] job at Newcastle. That will leave me ree with the ICA show I slould think. He didn't tell me. I heard it roundabout - so it may not be fixed yet.
      The weather here is very pleasent and mild. I hope it is so with you. If so it should be enchanting at Pett at this time of year. I feel sure you won't miss it too badly, my love, & you will still be able to visit it.
      Oh I love you so much.
      I adore you
      Lawrence
