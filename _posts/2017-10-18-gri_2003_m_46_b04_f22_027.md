      Dearest Lawrence,

      Herewith The photograph of the
      Cricket Field Painting - it is 18 1/2" x 24 1/2". The colouring is very
      Blue and green - cobalt and some
      "[unclear]new blue[/unclear]"- mainly the Former, and
      Emerald green; with Lemon yellow
      and Crome yellow (deep), and
      pinks and purples - warm -
      (in earth, road, and brambles)
      mainly of vandyke brown,
      burnt siena, and some Alyarin
      crimson (Rose Madder) The "[unclear]New[/unclear]
      Blue" is mainly in the foreground and
      the shadow on the road. The sky
      is mainly cobalt - and the texture
      and little white clouds do
      not come out in the photograph -
      perhaps you can just see they are
      on the right - The sky is very
      pale and misty looking and I
