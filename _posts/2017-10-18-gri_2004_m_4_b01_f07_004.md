      Blackheath
      Sunday

      Dearest Sylvia,

      The Leger exhibition is very interesting and I long to go with you shortly. I showed it to my class and also all the impressionists and post-impressionists, too. They were all exhausted. Then I left them and had my last visit to the French landscapes, making some notes. I tried to order a photograph of the River Gods but none is available, alas.

      Douglas Cooper was at the Tate, making notes, (no less than 30 items were lent by him) and seemed very interested in me, following me out of the Leger show into the post-impressionists at one point... He is even fatter than he looked up on the platform at Burlington House.

      Today, later on, Molly and Eric are coming, bringing Charles Perry: this is rather a bore but it is necessary as he has long wanted to come and I could think of no ruse to postpone it any longer.

      I have the Sunday Times delivered again: having read it this morning I have the old impulse to stop it again. Desmond McCarthy on Sartre and psycho-analysis... He refers to -  and I quote - 'anal and other complexes'.

      The weather has been charming: buds appearing everywhere. Blackheath Park is becoming prettier daily.

      I have at last written a poem: BAROQUE SONG

      Once in a landscape overgrown with ferns
      And shadows of the crumbling viaducts
      Cimon discovered by a bronze fountain
      A tiny animal
      A sleeping girl - shivering in her breasts.

      She dreamed of what girls dream of when the sun
      Is warm upon their legs and water plashes
      From mouths of the high dolphins in the basin
      And woke to see
      The gawking monster lurching on his staff.

      Converted to a castiglione
      By her panic, Cimon the rustic character
      Who wore a bird's-nest for a cod-piece
      Woke to Iphigenia
      Rose to her beauty like the unmewed falcon.

      Blackheath
      Sunday

      Dearest Sylvia,

      The Leger exhibition is very interesting and I long to go with you shortly. I showed it to me class and also all the impressionists and post-impressionists, too. They were all exhausted. Then I left them and had my last visit to the French landscapes, making some notes. I tried to order a photograph of the River Gods but none is available, alas.

      Douglas Cooper was at the Tate, making notes, (no less than 30 items were lent by him) and seemed very interested in me, following me out of the Leger show into the post-impressionists at one point. . . He is even fatter that he looked up on the platform at Burlington House.

      Today, later on, Molly and Eric are coming, bringing Charles Perry: this is rather a bore but is necessary as he has long wanted to come and I could think of no ruse to postpone it any longer.

      I have the Sunday Times delivered again: having read it this morning I have the old impulse to stop it again. Des-mond McCarthy on Sartre and psycho-analysis. . . he refers to - and I quote - 'anal and other complexes'.

      The weather has been charming: buds appearing every-where, Blackheath Park is becoming prettier daily.

      I have at last written a poem: BAROQUE SONG

      Once in a landscape overgrown with ferns
      And shadows of the crumbling viaducts
      Cimon discovered by a bronze fountain
      A sleeping girl -
      A tiny animal quivering in her breasts.

      She dreamed of what girls dream of when the sun
      Is warm upon their legs and water plashes
      From mouths of the high dolphins in the basin
      And woke to see
      The gawking monster lurching on his staff.

      Converted to a castiglione
      By her panic, Cimon the rustic character
      Who wore a bird's -nest for a cod-piece
      Woke to Iphigenia
      Rose to her beauty like the unmewed falcon.
