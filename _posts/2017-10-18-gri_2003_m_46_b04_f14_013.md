      Dearest Lawrence,
      I am most excited and interested to hear of the B.B.C. appointment board.  I told Tiny and she too thought it very exciting - shouldn't you get Delys Powell at/and someone influential to write on your behalf to the B.B.C before Monday?
      Michael is better now and more cheerful - he painted most of to-day.  If you get the water-colours for me will you please send one here as Michael wants to send something too and I think this is a good thing.  I shall send the Laruns and the Horse-Chestnut Bloom and decanter.
      I am so glad that you like my hats.
      I am not sure whether my latest water colour is a success or not! I shall examine it to-morrow  I worked on "The [unclear][/unclear] to-day
