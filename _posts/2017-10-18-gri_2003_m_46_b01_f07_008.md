      threat to our love is not my impatience but your super-ego: and I hope you will
      understand when I say that I do not think it is a very formidable one. It makes
      you wretched, sometimes, I know, and as I discovered at Pett last time I am
      helpless once it takes over. But the point is that these expressions of early
      allegiance are not the central figures of your personality as you have proved
      often. You prove it, for example, by loving me, despite pains and obstacles.
      So dearest Sylvia never forget that I love you, fiercely, naively, tenderly.
      I judge your love to make you happy (despite trials) because that is what my
      love for you does for me. Please, darling, measure my love by yours. I believe
      passionately in yours and need no proof of mine since outside it nothing has
      any meaning for me. \n\nI was pleased to read that your hands are smooth, your
      nails long. That your hair is fairer and your lines smoother: bit I do remember
      that when I last saw you, you were a ravishing creature and that you, following
      Michael's lead, have exaggerated fantastically, the evidence of Angst. Mirrors
      are not entirely objective after all: there is always the beholder as an unstable
      element, willful in doubt. Changes or no I cannot wait to see you again. Do,
      soon, if you can, let me know when you will be able to come to Wimbledon. At
      present I do not really know when you expect to come back to this island: I
      shall be alone here from 16 to 26 August. "

        Our letters seem to havecrossed and in mine I have discussed a subject you bring up in yours. I shall not tire of separations - any more than Astrophel's desire for Stella was lessened by his literally insurmountable difficulties. The worst threat to our love is not my impatience but your super-ego : and I hope you will understand when I say that I do not think it is a very formidably one. It makes you wretched, sometimes, I know, and as I discovered at Pett last time I am helpless once it takes over. But the point is that these expressions of early alleigance are not proved often. You prove it, for example, by loving me, despite pains and obstacles. So dearest Sylvia never forget that I love you, fiercely, naively, tenderly. I judge your love to make you happy (despite trials) because that is what my love for you does for me. Please, darling, measure my love by yours. I believe passionately in yours and need no proof of mine since outside it nothing has any meaning for me.

        I was pleased to read that your hands are smooth, your nails long. That your hair is fairer and your lines smoother: but I do remember that when I last saw you, you were a ravishing creature and that you, following Michael's lead, have exaggerated fantastically, the evidence of Angst. Mirrors are not entirely an unstable element, wilful in doubt- Changes or no I cannot wait to see you again. Do, soon, if you can, let me know when you will be able to come to Wimbledon. At present I do not really know when you expect to come bat to to this island : I shall be alone here from 16 to the 28 august.

      We venture on the field of love
      Guided by green equivalents
      which do for love with symbols can.

      We cannot move without fulfilling
      Laws of nature and desire:
      Fidelity, an evergreen.

I have also been revising one or two of other poems which you have copies: one revised piece is at the end.  And, yes, I do won the book of masques and you shall certainly borrow it: how felicitous that you were dressed as you were when you read that tine exerpt...

It makes you wretched, sometimes, I know, and as I discovered at Petts last time I am helpless once it takes over.  But the point is that these expressions of early alleigance are not the central features of your personality as you have proved often.  You prove it, for example, by your loving me, despite pains and obstacles.
