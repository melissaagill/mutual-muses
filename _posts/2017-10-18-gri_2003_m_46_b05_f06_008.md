      Blackheath
      23 VI 52
      Dearest Sylvia
      It is very kind of Tiny to invite me to Pett for the weekend following the fete. I should adore to come. I could not come until Saturday evening as I have an afternoon lecture on 5th but I could stay until Thursday morning. I have two lectures on Thursday (10th)  afternoon. I must check on these dates but I am pretty sure from 5th-10th I am free. Could a lion be put up with for that period of time? I should love to come. I am simply dying to see  you again my love.
      The Hunterian Collection is very pleasant and I look forward to taking you there later. The Poulenc-Bernor recital was charming. I enjoyed the Hugo Wolf songs best. It was you who introduced me to Wolf - remember my impresario cat? I enclose the programme: the choice of pieces is nice, exactly what one expected - except I hoped for some Satie, also.
      I have a busy day today: this morning I must review the Blackheath Art Society exh,; then go to the Tate to make notes for next Thursday's Constable lecture; then try and contact a psychologist whis is delaying with his Athena article; & finally, at 6.00, get to Finsbury Public Library for the opening of a show of Children's Drawings. Phew, says Dandy: he won't get his 10 minutes reading in today!
      The British Films' love-making is growing into an article on Clothes and Sex in the Cinema.
      By the way, poets should not use words commonly: that is why I prefer 'shit' to 'dung'. When readers expet me to say 'shit' then 'dung' will be accessible to me. (Also dung is not the right sound in that poem.)
      I adore you, love you
      Lawrence

      (10th) afternoon. I must check on there dates but I am\npretty sure from 5th

      love to come. I am\nsimply dying to see you again my love.\n\nThe Hunterian
      collection is very pleasant and I look for-\nward to taking you there later.
      The Paulenc - Bernor recit-\nal was charming. I enjoyed the Hugo Wolf songs
      best. It\nwas you who introduced me to Wolf - remember my [unclear][/unclear]\ncat?
      I enclose the programme: the choice of pieces is nice,\nexactly what one expected
