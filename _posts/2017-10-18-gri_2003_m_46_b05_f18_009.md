      2 a lecture here in the Autumn. I
      think I like the sound of Arles! It's
      the mistral that is the trouble
      I understand. Did [unclear]Lives[/unclear] hear your lecture? I should have liked to
      have heard your Hodgkins lecture -
      I'm very interested in your idea of
      Stafford pottering influence - from the
      actual to the representational as I
      were. You are busy this week -
      I suppose you won't have time to
      do much writing! I do hope
      [unclear][/unclear], Cregan is free!

      I expect you will be on the New-
      castle short list - you may even
      get it!

      I hope your evening with Father went
      well. How was the meduim - did
      anything materialise? I hope Robert
      was amusing.

      Thank you for the advertisement

      I understand. Did [unclear]Lines[/unclear] hear you
      lecture? I should have liked to
      have heard your Hodgkins lecture -
      I'm very interested in your idea of
      Stafford [unclear]polleny[/unclear] influence - from the
      actual to the representational as it
      were. You are busy this week -
      I suppose you won't have time to
      do much writing! I do hope
      [unclear]June Cregan[/unclear] is free!
      I expect you will be on the [unclear]Neo-
      castle[/unclear] short list - you may even
      get it!
      I hope your evening with father went
      well - how was the medium - did
      anything materialize? I hope Robert
      was amusing.
      Thank you for the advertisement
      glass.
