      Monday

      Thank you for your letter.  Yes you have guessed the Moliere play, my erudite cat.  I cannot send your prize by post but will award it in person one day.

      The Tumbridge Wells people want me to change the lecture day to November or December.  I suppose I shall have to but it's a nuisance.

      I cannot wrist much this morning.  It is early and I am already dressed in my suit.  I must be off to ring up various people before they all go out and then go to Penguin Books.

      You will be glad to know Charles and I are thoroughly reconciled - he can't see me too much though I can see him too much...

      I will write again tomorrow, I adore you.. Lawrence

      I love you
      L.
