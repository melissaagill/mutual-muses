      4    very art you practice is not only
      intensely masochistic, but treason
      as Clifford says.  According to
      Austen art is a mirror to show us
      our defects--which becomes the
      most interesting of all games!  Then
      apparently the artist, canvas in these
      dilemmas, ust hope "that some
      unforeseen mishap with intervene to
      ruin his effect"!  I should have
      thought that was a heresy as our
      talents are God-given and it is our
      duty to make the best of them, as
      illustrated in the Gospels in the parable
      of the unprofitable servant--
      Gerrard mainly Hopkins had a
      bit of this kind of trouble but was
      rather less arrogant about it.  Sir
      John of the Cross did not seem to
      suffer quite in the same way.
      I shall finish this tomorrow as it is
      getting late and I think I should go to
      bed.  I do hope Clifford hears your
      lecture tomorrow.  Will you come on
      Thursday afternoon now?  Sleep well
      my love, and come as soon as you can.

      delimma's, must hope "that some
      unforseen mishap will intervene to
      ruin his effect"! I should have
      thought that was a heresy as our
      talents are God-given and it is our
      duty to make the best of them, as
      illustrated in the Gosepels in the parable
      of the unprofitable servant -
      Gerrard Manly Hopkins had a
      bit of this kind of trouble, but was
      rather less arragent about it - Sr.
      John of the Cross did not seem to
      suffer quite in the same way.
      I shall finish this to-morrow, as it is
      getting late and I think I should go to
      bed. I do hope Clifford hears your
      lecture to-morrow. Will you come on
      Thursday afternoon now? Sleep well
      my love, and come as soon as you can.
