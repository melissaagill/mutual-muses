      soon be ready for us.  I hope that I can follow you in very soon.  Judg-ing from your conversation with Domatt & with his assistant the house will be elegant and comfort.  Just right for a cat.  I'm glad that Bullock is so thorough.  It means there shouldn't be any slip ups in the proceedings.  I con't wait for this to be finished so we can marry & live at [unclear]Cleprartd [/unclear] Road.  There is nothing I want more.  I love you so much.

      As my work is going very badly I must return to it & try again.

      Remember I adore & love you Lawrence

      I miss you so much L
