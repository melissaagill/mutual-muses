      Blackheath                            Tuesday
      Dearest Sylvia:
           I do hope that your journey to Pett went
      off as smoothly as the journey to town just
      over a month ago - despite the addition
      of the boy.  Tell me all your adventures!  I
      trust that nothing was damaged: no frames
      chipped or canvasses scratched.  I must say,
      Mrs Salter seems efficient.  I was amazed
      that you took all you planned to take
      from Blackheath.  Thank you so very much
      for the ones you left me.
           When you came to town with the pictures
      the exhibition was, at least, a question-
      mark.  Now you return, with the exhib-
      itions a real success.  My heartfelt congrat-
      ulations, dearest creature, my love.
           So far this morning the weather has been
      very sunny but it is getting cloudy now,
      fitful.  How is it at Pett?  If the weather

      Blackheath Tuesday
      Dearest Sylvia:
      I do hope that your journey to [unclear]Pelt[/unclear] went off as smoothly as the journey to town just over a month ago - despite the addition of the boy.  Tell me all your adventures!  I trust that nothing was damaged: no frames chipped or canvases scratched.  I must say, Mrs Salter seems efficient.  I was amazed that you took all you planned to take from Blackheath.  Thank you so very much for the ones you left me.

      When you came to town with the pictures the exhibition was, at least, a question-mark.  Now you return, with the exhibit-ions a real success.  My heartfelt congrat-ulations, dearest creature, my love.

      So far this morning the weather has been very sunny but it is getting cloudy now, fitful.  How is it at [unclear]Pett[/unclear]?  If the weather
