      I am so glad that you had a lecture
      at the N.G. it is good for you to
      see that collection too for pleasure and
      comparative standards. I wonder
      how your surrealist lecture went if
      Whether there were any interesting
      questions and whether they were
      at all aggressive.

      Thank you for your letter this morning.
      I am delighted to hear that Pasmore
      was interested in my painting - I
      feel most exhaltant! I'm glad
      he is so friendly - it is rather nice
      for you to have so pleasant and
      distinguished an acquaintance - perhaps
      friend - I imagine we would not agree
      with him in many ways but he is un-
      doubtedly interesting - I imagine a bit
      of a partriarch!

      I painted this morning, the Farmers
      and Mrs Clark sat beside me - it
      was nice to have a companion -
      she very much admires my portrait
      of Clifford and wants me to paint
      her daughter which I hope to
      do next week. Do tell me when
