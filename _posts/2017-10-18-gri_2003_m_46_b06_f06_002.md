      Dearest Sylvia
      the Art News cheque ought to be in this letter and would be but for the following circumstance. though I asked you for £2. 2s. I expected the cheque to be for £3, 35. and I wanted you to use the extra guinea for your birthday present. that is what Gainsborough should pay - 3 guineas for 1,000 word. Instead the bastard had the impertinence to send me 1 guinea which I have returned with a demand for more. I am awfully sorry this has happened.
      I hope that today will not be too exhausting for you. I am sure it will be a pleasure, however. tomorrow sounds delightful, too. I hope you enjoy the TV coronation with ~Mrs [unclear]Imhas[/unclear] (how nice, how friendly she sounds).
      Yesterday I finished the TV play; did a treatment of the sound play; and drafted the 1st 30 shots of the film called PRIVATE ROAD (you rememver the project). On Wednesday I am dining with Alan Carter; Thursday with Frank - so that project advances nicely. On Friday I am seeing Michael Rinets & I will talk things over with him. Tomorrow - C-Day - I am staying home to write.
      I am happy that your dresses and paintings are coming nicely - congratulations.
      I love love love you
      Lawrence
