      The Arts Council have asked me to lecture in Yorkshire March 9-21. Now your exhibition opens on 5th. If it were one or two lectures only I would turn them down. But for two weeks I should get £50 plus expenses. What do you think? I shall have done much of my part before the exhibition opens. Would it depress you if I were away during the middle? If so I will stay: if the money were less I would turn it down but it is - as you know - an exceptional opportunity to get £50.
      Speaking of lectures: one woman who comes regularly to the TS gave me a book [unclear] voucher[/unclear] for xmas. 2 guineas - no less. So I bought a book of Henri Michaux L'ESPACE DU DEDANS and the Museum of Modern Art book on Dali. Coming out of the [unclear]Iverness[/unclear] with these purchases I met Robert Hait: he took me to the 50 Nectarines in St Martin's lane for dinner (you know how timely that was)
      Tomorrow as you know I have to see the film. I enclose a sketch [unclear]concerning Dandy[/unclear] as film critic.

      Would\nit depress you if I were away during the \nmiddle? If so I will stay;
      if the money\nwere less I would turn it down but it\nis - as you know - an exceptional
      oppor-\ntunity to get 50.\nSpeaking of lectures: one woman who \ncomes regularly
      to the TS gave me a book\ntoken for Xmas. 2 guineas - no less. So I\nbought
      a book of Henri Midaux L'ESPACE\nDE DEDANS & the Museum of Modern\nArt book
      on Dali. Coming out of Zwem-\nmeis with these purchases I met Robert\nHait:
      he took me to the 50 Restaurant in \nS Martin's Lane for dinner (you know how\ntimely
      that was).\nTomorrow as you know I have to\nsee two films. I enclose a sketch
      concerning\nDandy as film critic."
