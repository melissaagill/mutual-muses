      WIMbledon 1967
      11 MANSEL ROAD,
      WIMBLEDON.

      14.VI.1948

      My dearest Sylvia,

      Thank you for your letter.
      Much as I should like to I
      come on the Thursday I cannot.
      I approached mother but she
      was most unaccommodating.
      It must be Friday. I shall
      tell you in my next letter. (I'll
      write it tomorrow, post it, too)
      what time I'll be at Hastings.
      I think I'll come by train after
      all. I hope your plan still
      holds, of meeting me in Hastings
      and lunching there. Let me know
      won't you? [The only postcard
      I could get was Titian's Christ
      As Gardener (coloured) but I have a good
      detail card of St George himself
