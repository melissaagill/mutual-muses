      [4-9-49]

      Blackheath Sunday

      Dearest Sylvia,

      One French novelist - it was Balzac - used
      to work with his feet on a block of ice. I
      wish I had been so appointed today.

      Flaubert used to work mainly at night, so
      that day and night lost their meaning. I
      have done more - I have turned the whole week
      on its head by working all the weekend when
      most people relax. I shall have a rest to-
      morrow from Hogarth when most people start work
      again.

      I have written the 'Engravings: 1747-52'
      chapter in two days and it is finished. I
      have now four chapters more to write - only two
      of which require research. I shall make a
      start on The Election Series chapter in a few
      days. I should be within the schedule you
      prescribed for me when you left when I see you
      next.

      Writing is really for me, a process of dis-
      covery like a poem. I make up my mind as I
      write and the things that have occured to me
      about Hogarth are thus not too stale. I am
      quite pleased with the chapter.

      But I am tired too. It is nearly nine.
      I shall have a cold dinner now I think. I feel
      quite hungry. (I shall be glad when sweet rat-
      ioning period changes! You know what lions are.)

      Good night, my love, sleep well.

      [7-9-49]

      Blackheath

      Sunday

      Dearest Sylvia,

      One French novelist - was it Balzac - used
      to work with his feet on a block of ice.  I
      wish I had been so appointed today.

      Flaubert used to work mainly at night, so
      that day and night lost they meaning.  I
      have done more - I have turned the whole week
      on its head by working all the weekend when
      most people relax.  I shall have a rest to-
      morrow from Hogarth when most people start work
      again.

      I have written the 'Engravings :  1747 - 52'
      chapter in two days and it is finished.  I
      have now five chapters more to write - only two
      of which require research.  I shall make a
      start on The Election Series chapter in a few
      days.  I should be within the schedule you prescribed for me when you left when I see you
       next.

      Writing is really for me, a process of dis-
      covery like a poem.  I make up my mind as I
      write and the things that have occurred to me
      about Hogarth are thus not too stale.  I am
      quite pleased with the chapter.

      But I am tired, too.  It is nearly nine.
      I shall have a cold dinner now I think.  I feel
      quite hungry.  (I shall be glad when sweet rat-
      ioning period changes!  You know what lions are.)

      Good night, my love, sleep well.
