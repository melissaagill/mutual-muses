      tures are on the 11th and 12th August
      and on 25th.  If you come on the 7th
      I shall have to go to town on those
      days, nonetheless.

      Paul admired your oil with Vene-
      tian Victorian vase immensely:  he sat
      and looked at it for ages as soon as
      he came in.  He admires my Last Days
      of Virginia Dent very much:  if I

      Dearest Sylvia,

      Forgive my failure to write before
      but on Sunday I had no stamps and
      yesterday I had only my single fare
      to town  and my fare, with 1 1/2 d. over
      to get to Wimbledon, where some money
      awaited me.  Thank you for your nice
      long letter.

      I have talked with Mary Chamot and she
      has my address and will let me know
      when lectures are wanted in August
      as the demand arises.  My N.G. lec-
      tures are on 11th and 12th August.
      and on 25th.  If you come on the 7th
      I shall have to go to town on those
      days, nonetheless.

      Paul admired your oil with the Vene-
      tian Victorian vase immensely:  he sat
      and looked at it for ages as soon as
      he came in.  He admires my Last Days
      of Virginia Dent very much:  if I
      can finish it fast he will show it to
      the Watergate management.  It has to
      be fast as he may leave there and go
      to Dundee - as assistant designer.

      My article about films and cities is
      progressing slowly:  I am about half
      way.  It's called Key to the City.
