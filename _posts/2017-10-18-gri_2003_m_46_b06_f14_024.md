      They are both on various committee.
      Do you know Clive Bell's address?
      I'm so sorry to be so demanding--but
      it will soon be over.  I am so depressed
      about it that I wish I'd never
      begun.
      I'm sorry you are not sleeping better.
      I must admit I haven't been sleeping
      at all well.  I am more or less free
      of my cold now, but still very tired
      and utterly dejected.  I feel there's ab-
      solutely nothing to live for--of course
      there isn't, but I usually have more

    clean_transcription: 2. ring up Chase for I know he is very busy but I do want
      my cards. Could you send a card to Dr. Helen Rosenau? Do you know the address
      of Lawrence Gouring , and R. Mothihan ? They are both on  various commitee.
      Do you know Clive Bell's address?<br/>I'm sorry to be so demanding - but it
      will soon be over. I am so depressed about it that I wish I'd never begun.<br/>I'm
      sorry you are not sleeping better I must admit I haven't been sleeping at all
      well - I am more or less free of my cold now, but still very tired and utterly
      dejected. I feel there absolutely nothing to live for - of course there isn't,
      but I usually have more libido than this, and I don't care! I haven't got over
      the humiliation of you visit - and I find it very difficult to believe that
      it isn't over but that you don't like to admit it! Please excuse my querillousness
      - it is my low state of health and spirits. Clifford has been very sweet and
      comforting - he is lovely and cosy to weep on!
