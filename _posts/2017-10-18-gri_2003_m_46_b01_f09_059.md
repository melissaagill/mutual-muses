      cool additions to it conjure up delicious images. I shall hunt out a damson
      tree and examine it, if not with a Ruskinian precision, at least with a Hogarthian
      pleasure in its 'variety'.  What makes me happy too is your own satisfaction
      with it.  [unclear]Danylion[/unclear] puts a firm approving paw on your shoulder.\n\nAlas,
      that Michael does not learn. You charged me on the phone with not caring but
      in fact I do considerably. Our last unhappy talk has had the effect of battering
      me into a kind of restraint.  Possibly not permanent but working at the moment.
      You must not think; 'Oh, he is stopping loving me'.  I have not given up my
      hopes and I would not give you up even in order to help you.  I love you and
      hope for some meetings. But I shall try, as I have tried a bit in my letters,
      not to strain you emotionally.  I doubt if compromise will be possible indefinitely
      but it is time you had a rest. Tell me, however that it will not simply work
      in Michael's favour, because it is not easy for me.\n\nI love you\n\nI shall
      tell lines to expect me on the 12th.\n\nWe are unlucky with phones and this
      morning was no exception. Still it did get clearer towards the end and it is
      always enough to hear your voice to make my whiskers tremble with excitement.
      How I love you. You referred to a crisis? Do you mean there has been another
      one?  Poor, Sylvia, I hope that the Woods are being especially nice - I'm sure
      they are.\n\nLe Diable Au Corps: briefly, I did not approve of the introduction
      of death at the end where previously action had depended on character and perhaps
      the boy's early passages were to confident but we see the reason for this later

      contemptuous of it. (It is nice as a film though as I'm sure he'll agree.)\n\nI

Thank you for it. And how I long to see again the picture it vividly recreates though it has never left my mind's eye. Your cool additions to it conjure up deli-cious images. I shall hunt out a damson tree and examine it, if not with a Ruskinian precision, at least with a Ho-garthian pleasure it its 'variety'. What makes me happy too is your own satisfaction with it. Dandylion puts a firm approving paw on your shoulder.

      Alas that Michael does not learn. You charged me on the phone with not caring but in fact I do considerably. Our last unhappy talk has had the effect of battering me into a kind of restraint. Possibly not permanent but working at the moment. You must not think; 'Oh he is stopping loving me'. I have not given up my hopes and I

      I love you

      I shall tell Lines to expect me on the 12th.

      We are unlucky with phones and today was no exception. Still it did get clearer toward the end and it is always enough to hear your voice to make my whiskers tremble with excitement. How I love you. You referred to a crisis? Do you mean there has been another one? Poor, Sylvia, I hope that the Wood are being especially nice - I'm sure they are.

      Le Diable Au Corps: briefly, I did not approve of the intro-duction of death at the end where previously action had depended on character and perhaps the boy's early passages were too confi-dent but we see the reason for this later after all. I admired it very much otherwise: do ask Clifford what made him so con-temptuous of it. (It is nice as a film though as I'm sure he'll agree.)

      Dearest Sylvia,
      I am happy to have your letter, and it contains, at last, a drawing. I take such pleasure in your sketches, even the slightest and this is no exception. It is rough and luminous. Thank you for it. And how I long to see again the picture it vividly recreates though it has never left my mind's eye. Your cool additions to it conjure up delicious images. I shall hunt out a damson tree and examine it, if not with a Ruskinian precision, at least with a Hogarthian pleasure in its 'variety'. [unclear]Dandylion[/unclear] puts a firm approving paw on your shoulder.
      Alas, that Michael does not learn. You charged me on the phone with not caring but in fact I do considerably. Our last unhappy talk has had the effect of battering me into a kind of restraint. Possibly not permanent but working at the moment. You must not think; 'Oh, he is stopping loving me'. I have not given up my hopes and I would not give you up even in order to help you. i love you and hope for some meetings. But I shall try, as I have tried a bit in my letters, not to strain you emotionally. I doubt if compromise will be possible indefinitely but it is time you had a rest. Tell me, however, that it will not simply work in Michael's favour, because it is not easy for me.
      I love you.
      I shall tell Lines to expect me on the 12th.
      We are unlucky with phones and this morning was no exception. Still it did get clearer toward the end and it is always enough to hear your voice to make my whiskers tremble with excitement. How I love you. You referred to a crisis? Do you mean there has been another one? Poor, Sylvia, I hope that the Woods are being especially nice - I'm sure they are.
      Le Diable Au Corps: briefly, I did not approve of the introduction of death at the end where previously action had depended on character and perhaps the boy's early passages were too confident but we see the reason for this later after all. I admired it very much otherwise: do ask Clifford what made him so contemptuous of it. (It is nice as a film though as I'm sure he'll agree.)
      I must go and find some lunch. I hope for a steak. I shall write again after tea in time to catch the last post. I love you, I love you.
