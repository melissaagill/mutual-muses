      2. I long to paint really assured and unself conscious allegorical pictures and I hope that by copying people who took such things for granted as the best and latest thing to paint that I shall infuse into my work something of their spirit.
      Tiny sends her love and was delighted with your letter - showed it all round and though it sweet of Hetty. I am delighted to hear that you are getting poems ready to send to Sir O. ought you to badger Parsons gently, by the way?
      I do like the two verses you sent me, they are delightfully ingenious - but I am jealous of the "free" girls who are obviously Americans!
      I am very happy to hear of your successfu;l C18th lecture - I think that is a personal triumph - you are widening people's fields of appreciation I though that you would. I hope you know ALL about Sickert now!

      2. I long to paint really answered and
      unselfconscious allegorical pictures and I
      hope that by copying people who took
      such things for granted as the best and
      latest thing to paint that I shall
      infuse into my work something of their
      spirit.
      Tiny sends her love and was delighted
      with your letter - showed it all round
      and thought it sweet of Hetty. I am
      delighted to hear that you are getting
      poems ready to send to Sir O. ought
      you to badger Parsons gently, by the
      way?
      I do like the two verses you sent
      me, they are delightfully ingenious - but
      I am jealous of the "free" girls who are
      obviously Americans!
      I am very happy to hear of your
      successful 18th lecture - I think that
      is a personal triumph - you are wider-
      ing peoples' fields of appreciation I
      thought that you would. I hope
      you know all about Sickert now!
