      your pictures are now at [unclear]Bounlet's[/unclear]. I'm so sorry - I blame myself.

      I accidentally - how [unclear]graterque[/unclear] L [unclear]mopie[/unclear] of the selection committee not [unclear]tohone[/unclear] [unclear]laka[/unclear] two. I feel very angry when I even think of it.

      The [unclear]mentler[/unclear] seem to be enjoying [unclear]days[/unclear] it is not particularly warm. I hope, therefore, that Tiny will be able to sit for you, so that the picture can be completed. 10 does look well in your sketch. Don't forget - you have promised me some sketches.

      Dandy is writing this in a milk bar, in a corner, almost surrounded by mirrors.

      I love you,
