      Blackheath Monday
      Dearest Sylvia
      I shall not know about the tickets until Thursday. I have asked for tickets for 25th on as quickly after that date as possible.

      I am having my travellers' cheque made out for France and Italy - so we will be alright at Colmar. I suggest that you try and get some liera from your bank: the American Express where I am dealing say they have none.

      I enclose a form which you should fill in and send to your bank immediately. I have made a start on it. Send your bank your passport number and say you authorise them to get Travellers cheques & currency in your name. Tell them, too, that you will bring in person your passport and sign the travellers cheques [unclear]on[/unclear] on about may 25th.

      I enclose a cheque for 50 which you can pay in to your bank at the same time. Do not delay for time is precious now that we have heard, at last, from [unclear]Hodders[/unclear].

      [16-5-49]
      Blackheath  Monday
      Dearest Sylvia

      I shall not know about the tickets until Thursday. Have have asked for tickets for 25th or as quickly after that date as possible.

      I am having my travellers' cheques made out for France and Italy - so we will be alright at Colmar. I suggest that you try and get some lira from  your bank: the American Express where I am dealing say they have none.

      I enclose a form which you should fill in and send to your bank immediately.  I have made a start on it.  Send your bank your passport number and say you authorise them to get Travellers cheques & currency in your name.  Tell them, too, that you will bring in person your passport and sign the travellers cheques on or about May 25th.

      I enclose a cheque for L50 which you can pay in to your bank at the same time.  Do not delay for time is precious now that we have heard, at last, from Hodders.
