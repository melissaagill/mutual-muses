      2. I know that you are lecturing on
      Thursday - are you lecturing on Saturday?
      If not perhaps you would come down
      on Friday for the weekend? Would
      you like that? I have asked the
      Clarks - they are coming on Saturday
      (if they do come) and will leave on Sunday,
      and so could we. If you think this
      a good idea and you see the Woods
      on Monday perhaps you would discuss
      it with them. Clifford I know is willing
      and I don't think Marjorie has any
      real reason why not - especially as
      she leaves me alone in the house for
      days with Clifford.
           I don't mind being alone in the
      house at this time of year as it
      is not dark until late, and therefore
      not so dreary. I have plenty to do
      and hope to get some reading done -
      there is this week - and I have
      to dig a trench and manure it
      for the tomatoes and the lettuces
