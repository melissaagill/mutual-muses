      I will send off my poems in the
      next letter but I have not had time
      to write them out yet. You certainly must not bother about our book
      yet-a-while. You are too busy as it
      is, but I do appreciate that you still
      think of it.
           Molly referred to the evening at
      Iris' as follows, without prompting
      from me: she said that Michael's
      embarrassment in case you said
      something 'outrageous' was obvious
      to her but, she said, in her opinion,
      his fear was ridiculous because
      you were charming, witty, highly
      intelligent, and that your 'personality',
      in any case, would enable you to
      get away with anything. It is
      nice to hear my lover spoken of
      in these terms, and more, and I glowed.
      (Venetian Dandylion has attended
      recently a lecture[unclear] which[/unclear] much impressed him.)
