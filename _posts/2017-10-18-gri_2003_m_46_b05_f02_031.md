      \nDearest Sylvia \nIt is 10 to 5. I suppose your bus is just about in Hastings

      heads, sea, dark sky. \nMy lecture went very nicely: 30 or so people with stools
      whereas a short time ago the numbers were very low, as xou know. I used your

      After I have posted this I shall go to the R.A. and as I look at the pictures
      I shall think of our delightful visit together. You will be able to come back
      soon & I hopeyou will come with me again. \nYou made your lion so happy. Though

      Post Office: Lower Regent SC
      19 ii 1952

      Dearest Sylvia
      It is 10 to 5. I suppose your bus is just about
      in Hastings tho' perhaps not yet at the Depot. I
      envisage your profile reflected on the window
      in contrast to the wintry resort on the other side
      of the glass: promenade, roads, sea, dark sky.

      My lecture went very nicely: 30 or so people
      with [unclear]stand audiences[/unclear] a short time ago the members
      were very low, as you know. I used your
      petal-on-wet-roads patina of nip: how evocat-
      ive & appropriate! After I have posted this I
      shall go to the R.A. and as I look at the picture I
      shall think of our delightful visit together. You will
      be able to come back soon & I hope you will come
      with me again.

      You made your lion so happy. Though I am so
      sad you have gone I still feel the glow of gown
      preserve: as La Mart said to Orplie, embrac-
      ing him in the slods - "You still have the warmth of the world about you". So, though lonely, I feel you
      with me. I hope you feel so too. Remember
      our discussion and do not worry unduly.

      I adore you. I love you
      Lawrence
