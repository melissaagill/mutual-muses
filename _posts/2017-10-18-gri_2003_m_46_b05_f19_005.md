      [unclear]Mrs.[/unclear] Thornton the postmistress' sister
      came with some raspberries for Tiny, and

           I shall go [unclear]into[/unclear] the garden and paint
      now -- Clifford will go down to bathe
      alone -- I wish I could go but
      I feel very tired and weak to-day.
      I shall rest then I will be alright
      to-morrow.  I hope you have not
      to be in town too much in this
      hot weather -- I wonder if you
      will have many people this afternoon--

      from "the oak". <br/>I shall go into the garden and paint now. Clifford will
      go down to bathe alone. I wish I could go butI feel very tired and weak to-day.
      I shall rests then I will be alright  to-morrow. I hope you have not to be in
