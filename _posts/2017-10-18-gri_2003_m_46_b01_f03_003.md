      letter. I woke up to it. A dream of benevolent character receeded and a hand
      gave me your letter. I see your letter as an Aubade; the day will be fine I
      am now confident. I'm so glad you have found time for a painting - even if it
      is a watercolor. Dandylions always say that some-thing is better than nothing.
      You'll be able to do oils soon I'm sure. Tiny is being very nice - I'm so pleased.
      I went to Kilburn last night to see Evelyn but unfortunately she was out. I
      left a note and shall try and see her early in the week. The 6th it is. Darling.\nWhat
      a lovely phrase that is, about your 'happy-cat' feeling. When I read it I gave
      a little shiver and shut my eyes for a moment and felt myself smiling contentedly.
      I adore you. \nI am reading Cauguin's intimate journals. There is an in-teresting
      jaunty ironic account of these last days with Van Gogh and also this: 'In marriage,
      the greater cuckold of the two is the lover, whom a play at the Palais Royal
      calls \"the luckiest of the three\"'. There is a truth in this the academic
      Palais Royal approach is inclined to forget, indeed, never knew. After all M
      is with you continually and though this is part of his torment it is also a
      great part of mine. I find myself, when with other people, thinking of you in
      a rather curious manner. I try to sup-ress their presence and substitute yours.

      Saturday. 24 iv 1948
      My dearest Sylvia,
           Thank you for your letter.  I woke up to it.  A dream of benevolent character receded and a hand gave me your letter.  I see your letter as an Aubade; the day will be fine I am now confident.  I'm so glad you have found time for a painting - even if it is a watercolor.  Dandelions always say that something is better than nothing.  You'll be able to do oils soon, I'm sure.  Tiny is being very nice - I'm so pleased.  I went to Kilburn last night to see Evelyn but unfortunately she was out.  I left a note and shall try and see her early in the week.  The 6th it is.  Darling.
           What a lovely phrase that is, about your 'happy-cat' feeling.  When I read it I gave a little shiver and shut my eyes for a moment and felt myself smiling contentedly.  I adore you.
           I am reading Gauguin's intimate journals.  There is an interesting jaunty ironic account of those last days with Van Gogh and also this:  "In marriage, the greater cuckold of the two is the lover, whom a play at the Palais Royal calls 'the luckiest of the three.' "  There is a truth in this the academic Palais Royal approach is inclined to forget, indeed, never knew.  After all M is with you continually and though this is part of his torment it is also a great part of mine.  I find myself, when with other people, thinking of you in a rather curious manner.  I try and suppress their presence and substitute yours.  I start (in my head, it doesn't actually get to my face) to look at them as if they were you, smile as if it were you I was smiling at.  This schizoid
