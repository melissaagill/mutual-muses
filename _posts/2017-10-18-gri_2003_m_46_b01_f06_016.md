      none confirmed [unclear]the[/unclear] early decision of any heart. The imagine is, of course, incomplete even now. Every meeting even if 'uneventful' increases our experience. You see - I'm insatiable. I do love you.

      Only two [unclear]tely[/unclear] postcards, I'm afraid, from Greenwich - but I've got a Sandwich one. As I walked alone in the great empty galleries I remember an earlier visit. A vivid nostalgia possessed me. I looked at my reflection in numerous pictures and remembered that yours had been there. Even the squalid train journey had a kind of double-focus - of the past and the present.

      I am working, with some ingenuity on a loan, so it is possible, if I get it, I may see you in Paris. It is hypothetical, so do not be disappointed if it doesn't work. Anyway, perhaps, on second thoughts, I had better leave you and Michael
