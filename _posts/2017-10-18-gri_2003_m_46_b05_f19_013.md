      pleasant in the garden--though there
      has been a sale all day, and it
      is bringing down unripe apples
      and pears which is most disap-
      pointing as it is a good crop and
      the pears are really no good if they
      don't ripen on the tree.
      Gammon has cut down a frame
      for my big still life with the cupid
      and cut a stretcher, so I shall
      tack it on tomorrow and
      work on it again.  I also plan
      to work on Rinaldo and Armida.
      I hope your lectures have been
      going well.  I'm sure they have.
      Dear poet, I am longing to see
      you.  I love you.
