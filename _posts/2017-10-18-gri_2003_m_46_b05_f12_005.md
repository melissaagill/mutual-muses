      V and A
      Coat tails flying (my blue ones), here i am at
      the next stage.  My lecture went very nicely I
      think--60 or so people.  (If only that many
      would travel to the TG!)
      The temperature is up a bit.  Hope that does
      not mean rain this evening, after Banstead.
      I must do some work on my slides now
      (fairly complete, luckily).  So except for
      sending my love I must stop but, more
      tomorrow, my love.
      adore you
      Lawrence
