      Although there has been some mist the weather seems pleasant so I
      do hope you will have been able to paint your unfinished watercolor.
      I would I were able to be with you while you paint. I might, for
      example, read to you from a book I am reading to myself at
      present - Solitude & Privacy - 'a study of social isolation It's
      causes and therapy' by a Hungarian writer Paul Halwos. It is a psycho-
      logical-sociological study. Just the thing for my film book. Or
      you might prefer me to read Bemelmans. Certainly Bemelmans uses
      less jargon.
      I shall deliver 'Ajax' tomorrow to Chase - before lecturing twice at
      the N.G. in the afternoon. Then in the evening I am seeing Paul H.
      This afternoon - as you know - I am visiting Ithell and, then,
      this evening, Madeleine (for dinner). Then I hope I shall not have
      to go to Hampstead again for a bit.

      I love you, dearest Sylvia love you
      Lawrence
