      NG  3 December 1952
      Dearest Sylvia
      In 15 minutes it will be 3.00 and time to
      start my lecture on Claude.  Would that you
      were here.   Then I have to go to Banstead (via
      the V&A) for the Giovanni Bellini lecture:  once
      again I wish for your presence.
      I do apologize for not sending your
      things.  I shall do so tomorrow morning
      absolutely without fail.  I am so sorry but
      every day this week I have had a
      rush in the morning.  Do forgive me.
      I hope you are sleeping peacefully and
      well.  I am fairly fortunate at present
      but I always wake early unless you are
      with me in bed.  I only linger in bed when
      you are with me, my love.
      Velasquez 'Boar Hunt' is on view now--
      cleaned as you know in the 'somewhat battered it
      is enchanting.  Much more of Velasquez's hard
      is there than one had dared to hope.  Th epret-
      tiest color, too!

      N.G. 3 December 1952
      Dearest Sylvia
      In 15 minutes it will be 3.00 and time to start my lecture on Claude. Would that you were here. Then I have to go to Banstead (via the V&A) for the Giovanni Bellini lecture: once again I wish for your presence.
      I do apologise for not sending you r things. I shall do so tomorrow morning absolutely without fail. I am so sorry but every day this week I have had a rush in the morning Do forgive me.
      I hope you are sleeping peacefully and well. I am fairly fortunate at present but I always wake early unless you are with me in bed. I only linger in bed when you are with me, my love.
      Velanquez' Boar Hunt is on view now - cleaned as you know is the somewhat battered it is enchanting. Much more of Velanquez' hand is there than one had dared to hope. The prettiest color, too!
