      delight. Your letters come from another world:\nhere in Inghilterra it might
      be Autumn already. The\nleaves are going brown, many of them, and it has rain-\ned
      for two days. I have seen one bonfire of leaves\nand fear more summer-pyres.

      sounds most exciting and I\nhope it turns out to be a possible one: I have never\nheard
      of it. I envy you very much the Giordano\nceiling: I admire his Cupid and Psyche
      series at\nHampton Court but there my knowledge, alas, helas,\nstops. Johnson's
      disregard of it is typical. I\ncongratulate you on your 'lady painter': I need
      not \ntell you that she is totally unknown to me but I am\ninterested to hear
      all you have to say about her.\nThanks for your offer of your mannerist notes:
      I\nshall take the earliest advantage of this that I can.\nBeccafumi (I have
      seen only one original by him) is\na superb and original painter I think and

      though much about Sodoma but perhaps I can\nsee your notes on him too so that
      I may learn.\n\nThe Palazzo Pavizza sounds charming: your ceiling\nsounds most
      luxurious. Today, in Hampton Court, I\nwrote a poem for you. Like so many of
      mine it needs\na note. The early 17th century French movement of\nPreciosite

      Inghilterra

      Dearest Sylvia,

      Thank you so very much for, in two days, sixteen pages of correspondence.  You can imagine I think my delight.  Your letters come from another world: here in Inghilterra it might be Autumn already.  The leaves are going brown, many of them, and it has rained for two days.  I have seen one bonfire of leaves and fear more summer-pyres.  With what pleasure I read of the Italian scene you may conjecture: it is an added source of joy to the fact of hearing from you.

      Your query Giorgione sounds most exciting and I hope it turns out to be a possible one: I have never heard of it.  I envy you very much the Giordano ceiling: I admire his Cupid and Psyche series at Hampton Court but there my knowledge, alas, helas, stops.  Johnson's disregard of it is typical.  I congratulate you on your 'lady painter': I need not tell you that she is totally unknown to me but I am interested to hear all you have to say about her.  Thanks for your offer of your mannerist notes: I shall take the earliest advantage of this that I can.  Beccafumi (I have seen only one original by him) is a superb and original painter I think and you seem to have been treated to an absolute feast of his work.  I haven't though much about Sodoma but perhaps I can see your notes on him too so that I may learn.

      The Palazzo Pavizza sounds charming: your ceiling sounds most luxurious.  Today, in Hampton Court, I wrote a poem for you.  Like so many of mine it needs a note.  The early 17th century French movement of Preciosite produced 'la carte du Tendre' an elaborate map prepared to cover every amorous possibility or eventuality.  Iac d'indifference, the shore of declaration, a grotto for billets-doux, &c.  With that in mind and vaguely the landscape vignettes on your ceiling I wrote this:

      Vivid amorists design
      To capture by analogy
      Lyrical fallacies, passive in
      The ageless, natural ornaments

      A web of paths persuades the swain
      Like a labyrinth of kisses;
      A sigh trembles like a scalloped lily
      Nursed by the blue indifferent lake.

      has rained for two days.  I have seen one bonfire of leaves and fear more summer
