           I have decided that I must treat myself to a day
      at Brighton while the Regency Festival is on there.
      It sounds delicious: the furniture and ceramics in
      particular.     Today I have also been having a look
      at a couple of painted decorations - one of them con-
      nected by rumor and legend with Hogarth.     I should
      like you to see it one day.     Here is a very rough
      sketch of te main part of it, above te stairwell.
      (The site of Hogarth's house by the way has been en-
      tirely cleared now.)
      Well I must fly now to the post to try and get
      it before the last collection.      I have a minute
      left, however, and you can guess wat I want to say
      in it.      That I love you.     By the way:     I have sent in
      all three letters to you in Italy.     This is the
      fourth.     Again - I love you.
      [unclear]This[/unclear] so you
      [unclear]know[/unclear] if you
      [unclear]got them[/unclear] all.
      Lawrence
      P.S. Since the wall decoration I have skecthed
      derives (despite the [unclear]bare[/unclear] trees) from the
      [unclear]Claude[/unclear] - Tiepolo tradition of sea parts
      [unclear]with[/unclear] a mediterranean sky line I was
      reminded of you immediately.     I am
      so glad you are enjoying so many
      pictures - statues - places.     Look
      after yourself, darling.

    clean_transcription: 'I have decided that I must treat myself to a day at Brighton
      while the Regency Festival is on there.  It sounds delicious: the furniture
      and ceramics in particular.  Today I have also been having a look at a couple
      of painted decorations - one of them connected by rumor and legend with Hogarth.  I
      should like you to see it one day.  Here is a very rough sketch of the main
      part of it, above the stairwell. (The site of Hogarth''s house by the way has
      been entirely cleared now.)<br/>Well I must fly now to the post to try and get
      it before the last collection.  I have a minute left, however, and you can guess
      what I want to say in it.  That I love you.   By the way: I have sent in all
      three letters to you in Italy.  This is the fourth*.  Again - I love you.  Lawrence.<br/><br/>P.S.  Since
      all small decoration I have sketched derives (despite all bare trees) from its
      Claude Tepoli tradition of sea parts will a mediterranean sky line I was reminded
      of you immediates.  I am so glad you are enjoying so many pictures - statues
      - places.  Look after yourrely, darling.  L<br/><br/>* I say this so you can
      know if you have them all.'
