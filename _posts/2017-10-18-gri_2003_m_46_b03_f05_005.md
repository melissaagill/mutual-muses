      The Kensington Art Gallery show was reviewed in Art News by somebody called Rayner-Banham. He did not mention your pieces but was generally appreciative of the level of accomplishment and sensitivity by the show as a whole.

      I am looking forward very much to seeing the Berthe Morisot exhibition with you and I think Kenwood might be a nice outing too. However, I do want you to paint, provided you feel like painting, and I think it is more important for you to produce your pictures than to look at other people's (Kenwood will always be there after all). I am sure Berthe will be very stimulating, however, and I have deliberately refrained from going though I have been in the neighborhood so we can share it more fully.

      I went to Kenwood with Robert. Workmen are still there but it is delightful. Many Reynolds I am glad to say and a Gainsborough which will, I am sure, take away my cat's breath. Pretty garden and grounds also!

      Owing to my lateness in answering a telegram from Charles I missed a lecture at the N.G. this afternoon. He was very sorry but had had to ask Mrs. King. I listened to a part of it on Claude and Poussin: it was so tatty and muddled and banal.

      Banstead have asked me officially to lecture again in the autumn but no news from Toynbee yet.

      Write soon my dearest creature and tell me that you love me. This afternoon I was turning over a book and came across an 18th century view of the Villa D'Este and I was deluged, overpowered with memories of you in Italy. I do so love you, my beauty, my rose, my Minerva. I shall no more be cross. I am consumed by regret for my past bad spirits and shall atone by eleventh century adoration when we meet again. I love you, my dearest one, my only love, I adore you,
      Lawrence
