      about a boy who develops a hate for an old neigh-
      bour in an amazing 19c. house (Cles. Adams only in
      the sun of a California suburb). He has a sister - an-
      bathes on the way & this disturbs him. It has great
      quality - tho' the revelation about the
      neighbour is novelettish. First-rate landscapes.
      I hope you may be able to see it with me in the near
      future. You would be charmed by it. David (Julian
      [unclear]Clares[/unclear]) Bradley made it, you may remember.
      I have no real news except I am picking up
      the threads of my film book again in preparation
      for further work - mainly completing and relating
      half-finished section.
      My love, I adore you so much. I think of
      you [unclear]easily[/unclear] by day & [unclear]uneasily[/unclear], at night.
      love you
      Lawrence
