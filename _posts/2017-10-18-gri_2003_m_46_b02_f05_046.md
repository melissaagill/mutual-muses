      Dearest Sylvia,
      My love, my rose. I am so unhappy for you. I love you, though, so much and hope you will be able to let me protect you with the great love you have [unclear]awakened[/unclear] in me.

With your beauty inspiring me I know I can do well and I am sure my love helps you. Despite our intense and troubled day I feel this wonderful confidence in us with undiminished fervor. Our love, our art. Oh my dear Sylvia-how I adore you.
      Take care of yourself my love, as good care as I wish to be able care of you.

      Dearest Sylvia,
      My love, my rose. I am so unhappy
      for you. I love you, though, so
      much and hope you will be able
      to let me protect you with the great
      love you have awoken in me. I
      am like Cymon in the Boccaccio
      story who was a rustic creature un-
      til Ephigenia inspired him to become
      a marvelous castiglione. I am
      your courtier, your court poet,
      your love. With your beauty in-
      spiring me I know I can do well
      and I am sure my love helps you.
      Despite our intense & troubled day
      I feel this wonderful confidence
      in us with undiminished fervour.
      Our love, our [unclear]art[/unclear]. Oh my dear
      Sylvia - how I adore you.
           Take care of yourself, my love,
      as good care as I wish to be able
      [unclear]take[/unclear] of you.
