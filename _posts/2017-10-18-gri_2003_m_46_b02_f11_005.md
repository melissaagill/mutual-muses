      In the Train
      Wednesday - 7. December. 49

      Dearest Sylvia. My own sweet love.

      We have just stopped at Peterborough and so I have taken the opportunity to start a letter to you while the train is not shaking and your lion's hand will be easily readable.

      Nobody else has entered the apartment and the one man who was in it is having a lengthy lunch so I am pleasantly uncrowded, books all over the seats, legs stretched out, comfortably, thinking with tenderness, desire, and love of you, my beauty. I expect you will be in the N.G. now. I hope that your view of the cleaned '[unclear][/unclear]' will mean a new [unclear][/unclear] for your book. And is [unclear]not[/unclear] the [unclear]Domenidino[/unclear]pleasant?

      How very happy you have made me in the short space of four days, my magical beauty. Oh how I love you and how happy I am in the confidence of your love. How fortunate we are, loving each other so much, loving each other at the same time, and so well able to express our adoration. Darling, how arrogantly we move Clifford's definition of love.

      Your new painting is delightful and I long for its completion for I am absolutely certain that your apprehensions are without foundation. I am sure it will have the emotional and psychological richness of the Lady Hetty and yet present your conception in visual terms different fromt he cool light tones of Lady Hetty. It has continuity and unexpectedness which speaks of the authentic inspiration, my gifted painter. How can you doubt your importance as a painter? Your first doubts were, I think, about your abilities. Now I am sure you can have no doubt of your brilliance as a colourist, designer and draughtsman. Your present doubt is the contemporary validity or importance of your designs. I am

      In the Train
      Wednesday - 7, December, 49

      Dearest Sylvia. My own sweet love.
      We have just stopped at  Peterborough and so I have taken the opportunity to start a letter to you while the train is not shaking and your [unclear]lion's[/unclear] hand will be easily readable.
      Nobody else has entered the apartment and the one man who was in it is having a lengthy lunch so I am pleasantly uncrowded, books all over the seats, legs stretched out, comfortably, thinking with tenderness, desire and love of you, my beauty.  I expect you will be in the N. Gr. now.  I hope that your view of the cleaned [unclear]'srioste'[/unclear] will mean a new [unclear]viorgione[/unclear] for your book. And is not the Domenichino pleasant?

      How very happy you have made me in the short space of four days, my magical beauty, oh how I love you and how happy I am in the confidence of your love.  How fortunate we are, loving each other so much, loving each other at the same time, and so well able to express our adoration. Darling, how arrogantly we prove Clifford's definitions of love.
      Your new painting is delightful and I long for its completion for I am absolutely certain that your apprehensions are without foundation.  I am sure it will have the emotional and psychological richness of the [unclear]Cody Hetty[/unclear] and yet present your conception in visual terms different from the cool light tones of [unclear]Cody Hetty. [/unclear] It has the continuity and unexpectedness which speaks of the authentic inspiration, my gifted painter.  How can you doubt your importance as a painter? Your first doubts were, I think about your abilities.  Wow I am sure you can have no doubt of your brilliance as a colourist, designer, and draughtsman. Your present doubt is the contemporary validity of importance of your designs.  I am
