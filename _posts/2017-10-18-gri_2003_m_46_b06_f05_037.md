      IN THE KNOW
      Verse
      I want to learn your ABC
      Your background, your biography
      The simple things you delight in
      Words from the diary you write in
      Going to investigate you
      Rate you
      Tell me all, no matter how small.
      Chorus
      I want to know all you do
      What makes you happy or blue
      Tell me something old & something new
      I want to know all about you
      I want to know if its you
      Can I stop being slow?
      If its you, I want to know.
      I want to know if it's me that you need......
