      As for the lecture it seemed to be nicely received.  The
      people were interested and did not fidget or the expres-
      sion of polite fascination sustained by Ancartes was magni-
      ficent--a masterly piece of public service.  I felt that I
      should have applauded him--not the other way about.
      One thing amused me.  2 separate people told me confi-
      dentaly that they rather thought they had contributed to
      bringing me back to Lincoln so soon...
      I met Michael on Friday.  I was in the Lefenre:  a
      hand on my shoulder--the words 'Hello Sweetie'--and
      there was M. looking smart and well, I thought.
      Soon I shall see you again.  How impatient I am
      my darling.  I have a busy week until we meet--
      however.  Parmore to the tomorrow; TG on Tues-
      day; NG and Banstead on Wednesday (and lunch with
      Kenneth Mortin); TG on Thursday before Hasting.
      I adore you my love.  I love you
