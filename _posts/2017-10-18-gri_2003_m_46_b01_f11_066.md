      30th December 1948 - Wimbledon

      Dearest Sylvia,
      About Blackheath: the man, who is in the Army, is being posted and his wife has not yet decided whether to stay at Blackheath until March or to go to her people when her husband leaves on the 19th of this month. I am going there on Monday so I shall have some news then. We are alright for the flat provided only it is given up in time. If it should not be - shall I take somewhere before we go away or when we come back? If we take the latter course we could take a h√¥tel for a night and certainly find a temporary place and, also, save a few pounds. Do not worry, dearest, for it is likely that we will be able to move in to Blackheaths on our return from Stafford.
