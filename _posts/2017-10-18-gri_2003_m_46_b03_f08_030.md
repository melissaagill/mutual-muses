      of the Gothic door, absolve <br/>My classical shoulders of old allegiances:
      <br/>The ogee panels curve like wings and lead <br/>Swiftly to a vanishing point
      of stars.<br/>Poet of the revolving doors, who <br/>Goes round in the panels
      and keeps appearing, <br/>Skull and skin, belle and bone? <br/>Vertiginous gamut
      of the Dance of Death. <br/>Poet of the bead-curtain and the turnstile, <br/>Does
      the entrance culminate <br/>In Chinese and athletic marvels <br/>Fabulous in
      cages of the eye? <br/>One poet hangs a trapezee from the lintel <br/>And swings
      against the door like an impulse.<br/>It does not yield and he remains fixated
      <br/>Rigid as a monumental sculpture. <br/>Sentinel of a door marked Et Arcadia
      Ego, <br/>Erudite poet, answer the first person, <br/>Do the words on your door
      glow at night <br/>Or can you remember the matter till the dawn ?'
