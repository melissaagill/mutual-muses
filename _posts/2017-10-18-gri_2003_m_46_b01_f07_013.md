        Although I am always willing to be as fashion-
      able as I can intellectually, Telepathy is not for
      me. Absolutely NOT. I agree with you about living sub-
      jects [unclear][/unclear]. But I fail to see any kind
      of survival indicated in the squeaks and gibbers
      Aldous Buxley talked about in his amusing essay

        Alas, I shall not be able to go to Brighton
      after all. I have left it too late now and my
      lectures are upon me. They have me by the throat
      and escape is impossible.

        In a few minutes our, well Mother and Father's,
      Bath friends will be arriving for tea and I shall
      have to stop this letter. My only consolation is
      that there are some nice home-made cakes for tea.

        What are you doing I wonder this afternoon.
      It is nearly four on the 8th August. I despair
      of guessing which masterpiece of stone or paint
      is before you. Soft Umbrian hills around you?
      Are there trees anything like Peruginn's? Do you
      recall the Louvre Battle of Profane and Chaste
      love by Costa? I place you in such a landscape
      at this moment, very blue and spacious.

        by writing rather a long way ahead of your
      movements in Italy I hope to avoid your losing
      letters as you appear to have done at Siena.
      My timing was at fault I image. I am sorry
      you will not have had any letters at Perugia.
      But this and another should be at Bologna for
      you on the 11th. I trust so.

        Tomorrow I must go to the Wallace and look
      at the Metsus. You can imagine the mem-
      ories I shall encounter there. Indeed I have
      encountered them already; simply by writing
      this the past has taken form and urgency. I rem-
      ember looking out the window, over a Ciovanni
      da Bologna cast, and seeing you round a corner.
      Our taste for Bercher. And more more more more.

        I suppose you have selected Bologna mainly as a centre for travelling out daily to Paduea [unclear][/unclear]?
        I have to stop now and I want to go on because
      I love you so very much. I love you.

      Our taste for [unclear]Berchem[/unclear], Abd more more more more.

      I suppose you have seöected Bologna mainly as
      a centre for travelling out daily to Padua & c?

      I have to stop now and I want to go on because I love you so very much. I love you.

    clean_transcription: Although I am always willing to be as fashion-<br/>able as
      I can intellectually, telepathy is not for<br/>me. Absolutely not. I agree with
      you about living sub-<br/>jects. But I fail so see any kind<br/>of survival
      indicated in the squeaks and gibbers<br/>Aldous Huxley talked about in his amusing
      essay<br/>in the book you leant me.<br/><br/>Alas, I shall not be able to go
      to Brighton<br/>after all. I have left it too late now and my<br/>lectures are
      upon me. They have me by the throat<br/>and escape is impossible.<br/><br/>In
      a few minutes our, well Mother and Father's,<br/>Bath friends will be arriving
      for tea and I shall<br/>have to stop this letter. My only consolation is<br/>that
      there are some nice home-made cakes for tea.<br/><br/>What are you doing I wonder
      this afternoon.<br/>It is nearly four on the 8th August. I despair<br/>of guessing
      which masterpiece of stone or paint<br/>is before you. Soft Umbrian hills around
      you?<br/>Are the trees anything like Perugino's? Do you<br/>recall the Louvre
      Battle of Profane and Chaste<br/>love by Costa? I place you in such a landscape<br/>at
      this moment, very blue and spacious.<br/><br/>By writing rather a long way ahead
      of your<br/>movements in Italy I hope to avoid your losing<br/>letters as you
      appear to have done at Siena.<br/>My timing was at fault I imagine. I am sorry<br/>you
      will not have had any letters at Perugia.<br/>But this and another should be
      at Bologna for you on the 11th. I trust so.<br/><br/>Tomorrow I must go to the
      Wallace and look<br/>at the Metsus. You can imagine the mem-<br/>ories I shall
      encounter there. Indeed I have<br/>encountered them already; simply by writing<br/>this
      the past has taken form and urgency. I rem-<br/>ember looking out of the window,
      over a Giovanni<br/>da Bologna cast, and seeing you round a corner.<br/>Our
      taste for Berchem, Abd more more more more.<br/><br/>I suppose you have se"oected
      Bologna mainly as<br/>a centre for travelling out daily to Padua & c?<br/><br/>I
      have to stop now and I want to go on because I love you so very much. I love
      you.<br/>Lawrence
