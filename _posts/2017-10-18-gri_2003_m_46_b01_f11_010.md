      What degree of laughter do you intend? Let me say again how  your blackberries give me pleasure.
      What is happening about MacDonald? I ask, partly for M's sake, but also because of the oil you promised me. Is he coming soon or haven't you heard?
      Dearest you possess me in an amazing manner. My love for you is always uppermost in my mind. If I can tell you and show you a fragment of what I feel for you you need not fear for the future. Oh dearest I love you so much and together we will achieve so much in love and art.
      I saw The Way of the World last night and was very amused though by no means persuaded. Oh, and the dance was very dull at first but it was more amusing later on when I attempted various dances.
      Liz Perry, my partner, is rather tall as you can see.
