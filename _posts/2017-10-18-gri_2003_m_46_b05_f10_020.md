      Blackheath
      Monday
      Dearest Sylvia
      Your letter, describing your lack of sleep, fits me too. How I wish we were together the whole time, my love, my muse. What never fails to comfort me, however, is the news that you are painting, or planning to paint - and the still life with eggs and chestnuts sound marvelous. What a sensual conception - the range of rounded yet differently textured forms - staggering - it is one of my favorite pictures already!

      My father has given me a ring - smaller than perhaps is our ideal but admirable all the same: it was gien to him by his mother about 36 years ago. It is gold with a bloodstone (dark green, red-flecked): about this size.

      I have been improving my sound Barrier article in the way that you suggested and am now on my way to the V and A (or nearly).

      I am so glad that you are interested, warmly, in your lecture: I am sure it will be absolutely brilliant. I have learned much from you already. I have found a nice book in the library, by the way, a recent study of The Dance in French Literature: Fautier, Mallarme, Valery, Cocteau on the dance. I shall use it in my Degas lecture at Hastings. Also it is the fuel for my Codean [unclear][/unclear] chapter - clarifying some things.

      I gather you will go this evening to the lecture of Modern Art. I do hope it is not absurd. Tell me all about in my love & I hope that you enjoy yourself - perhaps you will . . .

      The National Film Theatre is having a programme of Rene Clair films in November (I can't wait). Thank you so much for the cuttings.

      [unclear]Ridy [/unclear] has given me a lot of useful advice on typograph so the Nov. ATHENE should not be too dusty in appearance.

      This evening, after V&A, I am having tea with Herbert Reiser who has taken photos for ATHENE. I shall tell him about your exhibition.

      Dearest Sylvia I adore you

      I adore you

      Blackheath [20-10-52]
      Monday

      Dearest Sylvia
      Your letter, describing your lack of sleep, fits me too. How I wish
      we were together the whole time, my love, my muse. What never fails
      to comfort me, however, is the news that you are painting, or planning to
      paint - and the Still life with eggs and chestnuts sound marvelous.
      What a sensual conception - the range of rounded yet differently textured
      forms - staggering. It is one of my favorite pictures already!
      My father has given me a ring - smaller than perhaps is our ideal but
      admirable all the same: it was given to him by his mother about 36 years
      ago. It is gold with bloodstone (dark green, [unclear]red-flecked[/unclear]): about this size.
      I have been improving my Sound Barrier article in the way that
      you suggested and am now on my way to the V and A (or nearly).
      I am so glad that you are interested warmly, in your lecture: I am sure it
      will be absolutes brilliant. I have learned much from you already. I
      have found a nice book in the library, by the way, and recent study on The
      Dance in French literature: Gautier, Mallarme, Valery, Cocteau on the
      dance. I shall use it in my Degas lecture at Hastings. Also it is use-
      ful for my Cocteau film chapter - clarifying something.
      I gather you will go this evening to the lecture of Modern Art. I
      do hope it is not absurd. Tell me all about it my love as & I hope
      that you enjoy yourself - perhaps you will...
      The National Film Theatre is having a programme of Rene Clair film
      in November (I can't wait). Thank you so much for the cuttings.
      Riding has given me a lot of useful advice on typographs so
      the NOV. ATHENE should not be too dusty in appearance.
      This evening, after V & A, I am having tea with Merhart Reines
      who has taken photos for ATHENE. I shall tell him about your
      exhibition.
      Dearest Sylvia I adore you
      I adore you
