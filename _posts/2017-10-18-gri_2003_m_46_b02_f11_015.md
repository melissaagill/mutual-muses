      44 Queen Street Redcar Yorkshire

      10 xii 1949

      My dearest Sylvia -

      Your letter arrived by the second post and I hasten to reply. I am sitting in the reference room, my reference room it is fast becoming, having just phoned the station. Still now news of the exhibition I am glad to say. I have started reading Sir Osbert's Great Morning and I have also drafted the whole of my NS and N review. I read the entire length of the American book about Hogarth yesterday. I am very glad that the exhibition has not appeared and I have been able to stay by the coal-fire at Queen Street for my stomach trouble has not yet disappeared though I believe I am, today, decidedly better. It has "come on" me several times in the afternoon but not, thank goodness, this afternoon.

Still no news of the exhibition I am glad to say. I have started reading Sir Osbert's Greta Morning and I have drafted the whole of my NS and N review. I read
      the entire length of the American book about Hogarth yesterday. I am very glad that the exhibition has not appeared and I have been able to stay by the coal-fire at Queen Street for my stomach trouble has not yet dis-appeared though, I believe I am, today decidedly better. IC has "come on" me several times in the afternoon but not, thank goodness, this afternoon.
