      Thursday
      Dearest Sylvia
      Thank you for your two letters [unclear]irh[/unclear] [unclear]ics[/unclear] reached me today. I think I will rest all the mosaic matters first; I ordered your tea this afternoon and they will send it to you and I have already dispatched your nation books. It was most kind of you to send the [unclear]cranmalade[/unclear]  to mother, she is very pleased with it, as a gift and for its taste. Thank you too for my slippers and the comb. But what about the comb: mine turned up at home (in my dressing gown pocket) so have you sent me [unclear]Michaels'[/unclear]? I am very happy that you are to have extra time in Italy. You can still come to Wimbledon on your return, I hope. I now have three lectures at the N.G., all before you return: Dutch genre (bugger), [unclear]V elas, wez [/unclear] and Zurbaran, and Hogarth. I asked C.J. for mannerist for he has chosen to ignore this. You ask about nation books: when I went abroad I took mine but apparently this was unnecessary
