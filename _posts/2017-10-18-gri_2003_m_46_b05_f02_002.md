      In the train: 2 February. Evening.

      Dearest Sylvia
      The ICA was very dreary. The only lively note was mine: I
      was a kind of Senator MacCarthy about the art critics who like
      Ceylonese painting and also sternly imperialistic about the
      art itself. Everybody else was calm & competent except for
      Patrick Heron who backed me up rather civilly. Not many
      people came.

      You know Mariane Moore writes syllabic verse. I like her so
      much now. Here is a poem dedicated to her:

      It's nobody's business
      the things she can do with animals,
      trick them out in haloes
      of feathers, atmosphere & light, or states.

      Fabulist lady, she
      moralises the mongoose, makes the
      lizard a literate¨
      [unclear]actor[/unclear] in the pebbles & stream of verse:

      her tongue goes out like 'quotes'
      around the unsuspecting fly and
      reader who finds himself
      of the fabulists' present company.

      Here is the new song for the Travel Agent & the girl.

      A When I go abroad I want the leisure
      to search palming stores for planted literature.

      9 when I go abroad I don't want it said
      She only went for places that were dead.
