      Today is August Bank Holiday.  It feels like Sunday.  Father is castrating things in the garden.  I sit naked by my open window to write this.  No apples on our trees this year but I hardly miss them since the roses are still here.  this afternoon Claire, the French student I told you of in another letter, is coming.  She hopes to live in England for two months on Â£15: she is living at the McHale's place free.  So perhaps she can manage it.  As she intends to study English poetry etc I shall lend her what books she wants.  She tells me Albert has not painted much: I am sorry to hear that.

      I have decided more or less exactly what to talk about at the N.G.  Metsu and Vermeer first.  Hogarth's Graham Children followed by Chardin, Gainsborough, and Reynolds children; The Age Of Innocence, 18th century sensibility and so on.  Landscapes: Claude, Dughet, Francisque Millet.

      Molly has put on a stone during her holiday.  Certainly she needed it.  I fear the reverse obtains with you:  after all you are leading the most active life from what you say in Italy.  I do hope you are not too tired.  You have not mentioned Michael:  please tell me how you and he are getting on.

      By the way what impressed you especially at the Jeu de Paume.  Are you inclined to revalue Monet for example?  Especially the big Femme Au Jardin.

      You say that you feel I am not so far away.  That is how I feel:  we are so used to being apart that really accidents of distance do not make much difference.  So that though I write in the poems about us being apart it is not particularly the experience of the moment that I draw on -  it is just that the imagery offers itself.  Miss you i do, of course, but not so much more than always.

      About the poems:  3 is a re-written version of one I sent you the other day.  1 and 2 you already have, I think.

      I have to close now because Mother warns me lunch is fifteen minutes off and I have to wash and dress.  Thanks again for your letter which was a treasure chest of joys for me.  I am so pleased you are seeing so much.  And I am glad you like Florence so well:  I have always thought it must be superb.  Sicna in another way must be delighting you as I write (1 o'clock Monday).

      I love you

      needed it. I fear the reverse obtains with you: af-\nter all you are leading
      the most active life from what you\nsay in Italy. I do hope you are not too
      tired. You have\nnot mentioned Michael: please tell me how you and he are\ngetting
      on.\n\nBy the way what impressed you especially at the Jeu de\nPaume. Are you
      inclined to revalue Monet for example?\nEspecially the big Femmes Au Jardin.\n\nYou
      say that you feel I am not so far away. That is\nhow I feel: we are so used
      to being apart that really\naccidents of distance do not make much difference.
      So\nthat though I write in the poems about us being apart\nit is not particularly
      the experience of the moment that\nI draw on - it is just that the imagery offers
      itself.\nMiss you I do, of course, but not so much more than always.\n\nAbout
      the poems: 3 is a re-written version of one I \nsend you the other day. 1 and
      2 you already have, I\nthink.\n\nI have to close now because Mother warns me
      lunch is\nfifteen minutes off and I have to wash and dress. Thanks\nagain for
      your letter which was a treasure chest of joys\nfor me. I am so pleased you
      are seeing so much. And I \nam glad you like Florence so well: I have always
      thought\nit must be superb. Siena in another way must be delight-\ning you as
      I write (1 o'clock on Monday).\n\nI love you\nLaurence"
