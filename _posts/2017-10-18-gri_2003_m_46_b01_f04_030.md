      My dearest Eugenia
      Sorry that this letter must be in pencil but as you know my pen ran out and I cannot afford a re-fill just now because it is a [unclear}.  Nor is the typewriter available.

      What a great pleasure it is to me that you quote poetry and poets to me, now that the exam, studies are over.  Really, it is impossible to measure my joy.  I found fragments of a poem by Charles de Orleans in an ancient anthology and liked them very much.  It appears that his English poems were written in prison here.  [unclear], however, has not yet come my way.  Where did you find him?  Was he also on the wireless?

      O, how wonderful in the [unclear] image how well it suites us.  After all my would 'undo' us and the rareness of our meetings is, in my opinion, a test, yes, a trial and not, as Clifford believes, a help.  'The guardian knot which true loners knit undo it you cannot'.  I love you for sending it to me both for its intensive beauty and its fittingness to us.  How I long to see you, though even absence pulls the know tighter.

      I am looking at your watercolor of the owl and the rose.  It is delicious.  I won't part with it for the world and I do love a duplicate (a variant and not too different) can go into our book one day, my sweetest Eugenia.

      My dearest Sylvia

      Sorry that this letter must be in pencil but
      as you know my pen ran out and I cannot afford
      a re-fill just now because it is a biro. Nor is the
      typewriter available.

      What a great pleasure it is to me that you quote
      poetry and poets to me, now that the exam. studies
      are over. Really, it is impossible to measure my joy.
      I found fragments of a poem by Charles d'Orleans in
      an ancient anthology and liked them very much. It
      appears that his English poems were written in prison
      here. Digby, however, has not yet come my way. Where
      did you find him? Was he also on the wireless?

      O, how wonderful is the Gordian knot image.
      How well it suits us: after all M would 'undo' us and
      the rareness of our meetings is, in my opinion, a test.
      Yes, a trial and not, as Clifford believes, a help. 'The
      Gordian Knot 'which true lovers knit 'Undo it you
      cannot'. I love you for sending it to me both for
      its intrinsic beauty and its fittingness to us. How I long
      to see you, though even absence pulls the knot tighter.

      I am looking at your watercolours of the owl
      and the Rose. It is delicious. I won't part with it for
      the world but I do hope a duplicate (a variant -
      but not too different) can go into our book one day,

      My dearest Sylvia,

      Sorry that this letter must be in pencil but as you know my pen ran out and I cannot afford a re-fill just now because it is a biro. Nor is the typewriter available.

      What a great pleasure it is to me that you quote poetry and poets to me, now that the exam studies are over. Really, it is impossible to measure my joy. I found fragments of a poem by Charles de Orleans in an ancient anthology and liked them very much. It appears that his English poems were written in prison here. Digby, however, has not yet come my way. Where did you find him? Was he also on the [unclear]wielers[/unclear]?

      O, how wonderful is the Gordian knot image. How well it unites us after all that would 'undo' us and the rareness of our meetings is, in my opinion, a test yes, a trial and not, as Clifford believes, a help. The Gordian knot 'which true loners knit' 'undo it you cannot.' I love you for sending it to me both for its intensive beauty and its fittingness to us. How I long to see you, though even absence pulls the knot tighter.

      I am looking at your watercolors of the owl and the rose. It is delicious. I won't part with it for the world but I do hope a duplicate (or variant- but not too different) can go into our book one day, my sweetest Sylvia.

      My dearest Eylnia

      Sorry that this letter must be in pencil but as you know my pen ran out and I cannot afford a re-fill just now because it is a biro.  Nor is the typewriter available.

      What a great pleasure it is to me that you quote poetry and poets to me, now that the exam studies are over.  Really, it is impossible to measure my joy.  I found fragments of a poem by Charles de Orleans in an ancient anthology and liked them very much.  It appears that his English poems were written in prison here.  Digby, however, has not yet come my way.  Where did you find him?  Was he also on the wireless?

      O, how wonderful is the [unclear]Gordian  knot[/unclear] image.  How well it suits us: after all [unclear]my[/unclear] would 'undo' us and the rareness of our meetings is, in my opinion, a test. Yes, a trial and not, as Clifford believes, a help. 'The Gordian knot 'which true lovers knit 'Undo it you cannot'.  I love you for sending it to me both for its intrinsic beauty and its fittingness to us.  How I long to see you, though even absence pulls the know tighter.

      I am looking at your watercolour of the owl and the rose.  It is delicious.  I own't part with it for the world but I do hope a duplicate (a variant - but not too different) can do into our book one day, my sweetest Eylnia

      dearest Sylvia<br/><br/>Sorry that this letter must be in pencil but as you
      know my pen ran out and I cannot afford a re-fill just now because it is a biro.  Nor

      you quote poetry and poets to me, now that the exam, studies are ones.  Really,
      it is impossible to measure my joy.  I found fragments of a poem by Charles

      how wonderful in the Indian  image. How well it suits us.  After all it would

      My dearest Sylvia
      Sorry that this letter must be in pencil, but as you know my pen ran out and I cannot afford a re-fill just now because it is a biro. Nor is the typewriter available.
      What a great pleasure it is to me that you quote poetry and poets to me, now that the exam. studies are over.  Really, it is impossible to measure my joy. I found fragments of a poem by Charles de Orleans in an ancient anthology and liked them very much. It appears that his English poems were written in prison here. O'gby, however, has not yet come my way. Where did you find him? Was he also on the wireless?
      O, how wonderful is the Indian that I may how well it suits us - after all my would 'undo' us and the rareness of out meetings is, in my opinion, a test nor, a trial and not, as Clifford believes, a help. 'The indian knot ' which true loners knit ' undo it you cannot.' I love you for sending it to me both for its intrinsic beauty and its fittingness to us. How I long to see you, [unclear][/unclear] even absence pulls the knot tighter.
      I am looking at your watercolor of the owl and the rose. it is delicious. I won't part with it for the world but I do hope a duplicate (or variant - but not too different) can go into our book one day, my sweetest Sylvia.
