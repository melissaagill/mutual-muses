      even to former years ago and there are at least as many birds as ever before.
      Your letter came an hour or so after I reached here. I do hope that your tiredness has now worn off and that you have got round the inconvenience of the [unclear][/unclear] bedroom.
      My presents include a bread-knife, a dictionary of 1600 pages, a wonderful book called the Clerical Tradition, and an address book. Your ring has been much admired by Connie and Sheila who pooh-poohed mother's complaint that the setting was too "heavy".
      I think of you-in the most marked counterpoint in my present world-and love you intensely and find no bait of pleasure offered here distracting my adoration.
      I love you,
      Lawrence

      birds as ever before.<br/><br/>Your letter came an hour or so after I reached
      here.  I do hope that your tiredness has now worn off and that you have got
      round the inconvenience of the black bedroom.<br/><br/>My presents include a
      bread-knife, a dictionary of 1000 pages, a wonderful book called The Classical
      Tradition, and an address book.  Your ring has been much admired by Connie and
      Sheila who pooh-poohed mother's complaint that the setting was too 'heavy'.<br/><br/>I
      think of you - in the most marked counterpoint to my present world - and love
      you intensely and find no bait of pleasure offered here distracting my adoration.<br/><br/>I
      love you<br/>Lawrence<br/>
