      At th Heffer Gallery, Cambridge, there is an excellent exhibition of modern British sculpture. Almost everything on show is really recent: the only notable artist not represented by current work is Tunrbull, whose bronzes are 1951.
      Until recently many of the younger sculptors used biological forms lower than the human: this is supposed to express a feeling for life as something basic and pervasiv.
      There is a tendency now away from late surealist biomorphism towards more direct versions of the human image. Though a drawing of 1952 reminds us of Reg Butler's mastery of the B.E.M.

      Armitage i showing two single figures, both this year's. The best of them, I think, is no. 2. It is part-totem, part playing-card: nose, breats, navel, hands push out from both sides of the flatish bronze plate. The nicety with which he retains evocatice human fragments has an Italiante mannerist sensuality about it: he never loses the buttock's curves or dimples.
