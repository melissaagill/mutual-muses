      it will trace the 'uninterrupted flowing twist' of the line of grace. 'Now whoever can conceive lines thus constantly flowing, and delicately varying over every part of the body' will have 'a true idea of the word Taste when applied to form'. This tells us a great deal about Hogarth's view of the human body, mobile, ever-changing, expressing the life-force itself by an unquenchable variety. We must not forget, however, that behind Hogarth's interest in varied [unclear]surfaces[/unclear]is his grasp of solid form, which he demonstrates in the introduction.

      It follows from this that Hogarth rejects the tyranny of the table of ideal proportions drawn up not only by Lomazzo but by Durer, for he recognises the infinite variations of the body cannot be covered by every movement, as Hogarth points out, [unclear]evolving[/unclear]changes of muscle and a new distribution of weight. The eye is the arbiter of proportions as it is in the amazing profusion of form displayed in Hogarth's (and that of the French rococo equally) art.As a result of relying on the eye his estimation of Nature is higher than that of [unclear]new[/unclear] art theorists: 'Who, but a bigot, even to the antiques, will say that he has not seen faces and necks, hands and arms in living women, that even the Grecian Venus doth but coarsely imitate?' That Hogarth is well aware of his unorthodoxy is shown by a foot-note in which he compares artists he calls 'nature-menders' with 'Gulliver's taylor a Laputa, who, having taken measure of him for a suit of clothes, with a rule, quadrant, and compasses, after a considerable time spent, brought them home ill made'.
