      they are deliciously inventive
      and rich.  I have been reading
      the new 'Althene' and have

      I feel is rather "J. [unclear][/unclear]"
      "two-pence coloured"  I think
      her teaching experience must
      have been continued to S. [unclear]Ron[/unclear]:
      entirely.  Tiny has been reading
      it too--when I'm not.
      I am so glad about D.
      Parsons and your book.  I
