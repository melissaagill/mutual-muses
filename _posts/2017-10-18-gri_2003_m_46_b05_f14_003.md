      3 so he's going to walk along the front in Brighton!
      Is "Peter Banham" Rayner? I'm sorry you had the effort of the platform - I'm sure you were very good, you're a most marvellous speaker and everyone else seems like "poor poll" when you are there! I'm sorry that the artists and [unclear]Duthiart[/unclear] didn't turn up - how disappointing - what happened? I hope perhaps I may hear your lecture at the I.C.A. I do hope so. I'm very glad about the travel agency - it won't entail extra work will it?
       I do hope you are feeling strong again, do look after yourself it is so easy to get another cold when one is run down. I do enjoy your article on "Les jeux Interdits" it sounds most interesting. I'm glad that Robert took you - Shall I send him a card or will you? Thank you so much for thinking of more names - I have now addressed 150 envelopes!

      Banhaus" Reynes?  I''m sorry you had the effort of the platform - I''m sure
      you were very good. You''re a marvelous speaker and everyone else seem like
      ''poor poll'' when you''re there!  I''m sorry that the artists and Dethuit didn''t
      turn up - how disappointing - what happened?  I hope perhaps I may hear your
      lecture at the I.C.A.  I do hope so.  I''m very glad about the travel agency
      - it won''t entail much extra work will it?  I do hope you are feeling strong
      again, do look after yourself.  It is so easy to get another cold when one is
      run down.  I do enjoy your article on "Les Jeun Interdits" it sounds most interesting.  I''m
      so glad that Robert took you.  Shall I send him a card on with you?  Thank you
      so much for thinking of more names - I have now addressed 150 envelopes! '
