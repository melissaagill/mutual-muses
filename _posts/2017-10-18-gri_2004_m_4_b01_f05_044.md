      Dearest Sylvia

      I do seem to be busy this week: I have just finished preparing this evening's lecture ( on Drawings ) and , of course, before that I have a N.G. school lecture about English Landscape, to 15 14 year-old girls .. or 14 15 year-olds. But I had to stop that work and send you however a hasty line to say I adore you.

      The weather is charming today - so I hope that you will be able to paint. Last night, after the rain, was beautiful, the sky scattered with exquisite star-patterns.

      Globes like amaranthine showers
      Flow down-hill or flake
      And scatter asteroids in circles:
      We find the red in the black,
      The moment pinioned by the hours
      And the will to enter circles.

      Constellations barter light
      For precisions of the zodiac,
      Where symbols of libido
      Burgeon or are schematic
      In the tables of the night,
      Crossed by comets of the libido.

      (There is, I think, a reminiscence of Estaban Frances' paintings in this poem.)

      The begonia is battered and has lost its main branch but the smaller branch remains: I am tending it constantly and I believe what is left will survive.

      I love you, dearest Sylvia, I must do some work now, I love you,

      Wednesday
      Blackheath

      Dearest Sylvia

      I do seem to be busy this week:   I have just fin-
      wished preparing this evening's lecture (on Draw-
      ings) and, of course, before that I have a N.G.
      school lecture about English Landscape, to 15
      14 year-old girl or 14 15 year-olds.   But I had
      to stop that work and send you however hasty a line
      to say I adore you.

      The weather is charming today - so I hope that you
      will be able to paint.   Last night, after the rain,
      was beautiful, the sky scattered with exquisite star-
      patterns.

                Globes like amaranthine showers
                Flow down-hill or flake
                And scatter asteroids in circles:
                We find the red in the black.
                The moment pinioned by the hours
                And the will to enter circles.

                Constellations barter light
                For precisions of the zodiac,
                Where symbols of libido
                Burgeon or are schematic
                In the tables of the night,
                Crossed by comets of the libido.

      (There is, I think, a reminiscence of Esteban Frances'
      paintings in this poem.)

      The begonia is battered and has lost its main branch
      but the smaller branch remains:  I am tending it con-
      stantly and I believe what is left will survive.

      I love you, dearest Sylvia, I must do some work now,
      I love you.

      Dearest Sylvia

      I do seem to be busy this week:  I have just fin-
      ished preparing this evening's lecture (on Draw-
      ings) and, of course, before that I have a N.G.
      school lecture about English Landscape, to 15
      14 year-old girls or 14 15 year-olds.  But I had
      to stop that work and send you however, hasty  a line
      to say I adore you.

      The weather is charming today - so I hope that you
      will be able to paint.  Last night, after the rain,
      was beautiful, the sky scattered with exquisite star-
      patterns.

      Globes like amaranthine showers
      Flow down-hill or flake
      And scatter asteroids in circles:
      We find the red in the black,
      The moment pinioned by the hours
      And the will to enter circles.

      Constellations barter light
      For precisions of the zodiac,
      Where symbols of libido
      Burgeon or are achematic
      In the tables of the night,
      Crossed by comets of the libido.

      (There is, I think, a reminiscence of Esteban Frances'
      paintings in this poem)

      The begonia is battered and has lost its main branch
      but the smaller brance remains:  I am tending it con-
      stantly and I believe what is left will survive.

      I love you , dearest Sylvia, I must do some work now,
      I love you,

      Dearest Sylvia

      I do seem to be busy this week:  I have just finished preparing this evening's lecture (on Drawings) and, of course, before that I have a N.G. school lecture about English Landscape, to 15-14 year-old girls or 14 15 year-olds.  But I had to stop that work and send you however hasty a line to say I adore you.

      The weather is charming today - so I hope that you will be able to paint.  Last night, after the rain, was beautiful, the sky scattered with exquisite star patterns.

      Globes like amaranthine showers
      Flow down-hill or flake
      And scatter asteroids in circles:
      We find the red in the black,
      The moment pinioned by the hours
      And the will to enter circles.

      Constellations barter light
      For precisions of the zodiac,
      Where symbols of libido
      Burgeon or are schematic
      In the tables of the night,
      Crossed by comets of the libido.

      (There is, I think, a reminiscence of Esteban Frances' paintings in this poem.)

      The begonia is battered and has lost its main branch but the smaller branch remains:  I am tending it constantly and I believe what is left will survive.

      I love you, dearest Sylvia, I must do some work now, I love you,
      Lawrence
