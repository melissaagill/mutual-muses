      Tell me more news of your sweetness! I did some more work on my forge this morning--but not for long as it poured with fine rain and I got very wet--as did my canvas board. No sooner had I got home however it cleared up and there is now sun and wind--oh dear! I hope to do some more tomorrow.

      I love you, my poet, I adore you--work for your cat!

      I love you
