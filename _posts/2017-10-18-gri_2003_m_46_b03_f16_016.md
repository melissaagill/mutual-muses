      Dearest Lawrence,

      Thank you for your letter and the poem, which I find most stimulating and I feel a little uneasy - but am sure I shall enjoy when I have read it several times.

      I'm glad you enjoyed Brighton, but sorry about the bed. I hope you slept well when you got home. I shall look forward to hearing more of your visit which sounds worthy of a short story! I hope you had a good long night when you got home.

      Tiny and Clifford have read your poems with great interest and admiration - Clifford understood "the Childhood of the Poet" without prompting.

      You will be pleased to hear that I have at least finished my picture by the church - and I am pleased with it. I had to paint it lying on the grass as the wind was too high for an easel. Your latest letter

      Pett

      Dearest Lawrence,

      Thank you for your letter and the poem - which I find most stimulating and I feel a little uneasy - but am sure I shall enjoy when I have read it several times.

      I'm glad you enjoyed Brighton, but sorry about the bed I hope you slept well when you got home. I shall look forward to hearing more of your visit which sounds worthy of a short story! I hope you had a good long night when you got home.

      Tiny and Clifford have read your poems with great interest and admiration - Clifford understood "The Childhood of the Poet" without prompting.

      You will be pleased to hear that I have at last finished my picture by the church - and I am pleased with it. I had to paint it lying on the grass as the wind was too high for the easel - your latest letter
