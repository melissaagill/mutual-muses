      22 July

      Dearest Sylvia

      Thank you for sending me the piece of brown
      material which I think is very nice indeed
      and should be just right for an Edwardian
      suit. I should like to take advantage of
      this generous offer of yours, even though
      I cannot have it made up immediately.
      Thank you so very much, my dearest love.

      As M is going quite early away from
      Pett I shall expect you in Blackheath
      at the weekend of the Bank Holiday.
      Do stay as long as you can my love.

      I am busily getting my ICA lecture ready
      at the ICA itself. Then tomorrow I
      have to get 18th c. children in art ready
      for Thursday. My Watts' lecture yest-
      terday was unexpectedly well-attended
      and nicely received. Then Sutherland's
      Early Work on Friday and Les Fauna
      on Saturday in addition to completing
      The Travel Agent on Sunday.
