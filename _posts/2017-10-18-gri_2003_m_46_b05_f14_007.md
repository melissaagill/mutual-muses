      [unclear] Pattern [/unclear] Book and Chaplin in the train for I felt painfully miserable. I feel that I can't go on caring any-more it is too painful - but one has to bear these things because there is nothing else to do. To kill oneself seems undignified and is such a nuisance for everyone that it seems a spiteful [unclear] thing [/unclear] to do.
      I wish Tyler's style was a little tauter and more lucid - the book is very easy to read and fairly well reasoned, but I think not very well expressed. He says some interesting and provocative things but one can draw one's own conclusions as well.
      I don't think I've any other news - I'm sorry to be so dreary - I don't think I can stay here long alone. Perhaps it is because I am not well - but I do seem to get a dreadful melancholy here in spite of my liking it so much - I think I must keep to my own rooms more I think then I should be happier. Tiny is so brusque and uncomfortably bury all the time.

      Pattern Book and Chaplin in the
      train for I felt painfully miserable.
      I feel that I can't go on caring
      anymore if it is too painful - but
      one has to bear these things because
      there is nothing else to do. To kill
      oneself seems undignified and is
      such a nuisance for everyone that it
      seems a spiteful thing to do.
      I wish Tyler's style was a little
      tauter and more lucid - the book
      is very easy to read and fairly well
      reasoned, but I think not very well
      expressed. He says some interesting
      and provocative things but one
      can draw one's own conclusions
      as well.
      I don't think I have any other news -
      I'm sorry to be so dreary - I don't
      think I can stay here long alone.
      Perhaps it is because I am not
      well - but I do seem to get a

      of my liking it so much - I think
      I must keep to my own room more

      [unclear]Pattison[/unclear] Book and Chaplin is the
      train for I felt painfully miserable.
      I feel that I can't go on caring
      any-more if it is too painful - but
      one has to bear these things because
      there is nothing else to do. To kill
      oneself seems undignified and is
      such a nuisance for everyone that it
      seems a spiteful thing to do.
      I wish Tyler's style was a little
      tauter and more lucid - the book
      is very easy to read and fairly well
      reasoned, but I think not very well
      expressed. He says some interesting
      and provocative things but one
      can draw one's own conclusions as
      well.
      I don't think I've any other news.
      I'm sorry to be so dreary - I don't
      think I can stay here long alone
      Perhaps it is because I am not
      well - but I do seem to get a
      dreadful melancholy here in spite
      of  my liking it so much - I think
      I must keep to my own rooms more
      I think then I should be happier.
      Tiny is so brusque and uncomfortably
      busy all the time.
