      The Pump Room, Bath
      11 V 51
      Dearest Sylvia,
      Thank you so much for your letter.  I think Miller has
      chosen excellently, don't you, and to judge from what you
      write it was a successful meeting.  I need not say how
      pleased I am about this.  What a wonderful thought - a
      room of your work at the Redfern.  I am sure we will
      see it soon and Miller is clearly sympathetic.
      I am sorry that despite this encouraging news you should
      yet feel depressed.  I recognize immediately M's work
      and can only feel regret that you should acquiesce so quickly
      in his professional dreariness.  I could kill him.  Can
      he not allow you to be happy or, al least, tranquil
      for a few days on end?
      I shall be back soon: probably Tuesday.  We shall meet
      immediately - for both our sakes, for I miss you very
      much.  I so wish you were here.  I am writing this in
      the pump room"the spring bubbling on my left, an orchestra
      playing sentimental miscellanies from Edwardian
      musical comedies.

      The Pump Room Bath    11 v 51

      Dearest Sylvia,

      Thank you so much for your letter.  I think Miller has chosen excellently, don't you, and to judge from what you write it was a successful meeting.  I need not say I how pleased I am about this.  What a wonderful thought - a room of your work at the [unclear]Redfern[/unclear]:  I am sure we will see it soon and Miller is clearly sympathetic.

      I am sorry that despite this encouraging news you should yet feel depressed.  I recognize immediately M's work and can only feel regret that you [unclear]loved acquiesce[/unclear] so quickly in his professional dreariness.  I could kill him.  Can he not allow you to be happy or, at least, tranquil for a few days on end?

      I shall be back soon: probably Tuesday.  We shall meet immediately - for both our sakes, for I miss you very much.  I so wish you were here.  I am writing this in the pump room:  the spring bubbling on my left, an orchestra playing sentimental [unclear]miscellanic[/unclear] from Edwardson musical comedies.  Dandy taking the waters
