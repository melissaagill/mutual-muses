      Monday evening

      My dearest Sylvia,
      Sequel to my eight anthology of more images is this one, denoted to Owls. As I shall be in Pelt soon I thought it wise to flatten them a little

      1. When cats run home and liger is come
      And dew is cold upon [unclear]the[/unclear] ground
      And the far off stream is [unclear]dumb[/unclear],
      And the whirring soil goes round,
      And the whirring soil goes round;
      Alone and warming his fine wits,
      The white owl in the [unclear]belfry[/unclear] sits.

      That is [unclear]Tennyson[/unclear] and I need only alude in this next one for the whole poem to come in you:

      2. The owl looked up in the stars alone,
      And sang in a small guitar...

      The Nursery Rhyme:
      3. 'who'll dig his grave?'
      'I' said the Owl
      'With my spade and trowel,
      I'll dig his grave.'

      [unclear]Blake[/unclear], although I rather doubt the [unclear]are a unkid[/unclear] he puts our poor symbol:

      4. The owl that calls upon the night
      Speaks the unbeliever's fright

      Wallace [unclear]Stenem[/unclear] has written a poem called The Owl in the Sarcophagus but he doesn't mention an owl in it, but here's a quota-tion from the [unclear]amateur[/unclear] poem of his:

      5. The little owl flew through the night
      As if the people in [unclear]dream[/unclear]

      [8-6-48]
      WIMbledon 1967                     11 MANSEL ROAD,

      Monday evening                       WIMBLEDON.

      My dearest Sylvia,

      Sequel to my slight anthology of [unclear]nose[/unclear]
      images is this one, [unclear]denoted/devoted[/unclear] to Owls.  As
      I shall be in Pett soon I thought it wise
      to flatter them a little.
      1  when cats run home and light is come
      And dew is cold upon the ground
      And the far-off stream is dumb,
      And the whirring sail goes round,
      And the whirring sail goes round:
      Alone and warming his fine wits,
      The white owl in the belfrey sits.

      That is Tennyson and I need only alude
      to this next one for the whole poem to come
      to you:
      2  The owl looked up to the stars above,
      And sang to a small guitar ...
      The Nursery Rhyme:
      3  'who'll dig his grave?'
      'I' said the Owl
      'with my spade and trowel,
      I'll dig his grave.'
      Blake, though I rather doubt the use to which
      he puts our poor symbol:
      4  The owl that calls upon the night
      speaks the unbeliever's fright.
      Wallace [unclear]Stemens[/unclear] has written a poem called
      The Owl in the Sarcophagus but he doesn't
      mention an owl in it, but here's a quota-
      tion from another poem of his
      5  The little owl flew through the night
      As if the people in the air

      [8-6-48]
      WIMbledon 1967   11 Mansel Road, Wimbledon
      Monday evening
      My dearest Sylvia,
      Sequel to my slight anthology of rose
      images is this one, devoted to Owls. As
      I shall be in Pett soon I thought it wise
      to flatter them a little.
      1 When cats run home and light is come
      And dew is cold upon the ground
      And the far-off stream is dumb,
      And the whirring sail goes round,
      And the whirring sail goes round:
      Alone and warming his fine wits,
      The white owl in the belfrey sits.
      That is Tennyson and I need only alude
      in this next one for the whole poem to come
      to you:
      2 The owl looked up to the stars above,
      And sang to a small guitar...
      The Nursery Rhyme:
      3 'Who'll dig his grave?'
      'I', said the Owl
      'With my spade and trowel,
      I'll dig his grave'.
      Blake, though I rather doubt the use to which
      he puts our poor symbol:
      4 The owl that calls upon the night
      Speaks the unbeliever's fright.
      Wallace Stevens has written a poem called
      The Owl in the Sarcophagus but he doesn't
      mention an owl in it, but here's a quota-
      tion from another poem of his:
      5 The little owl flew through the night
      As if the people in the air
