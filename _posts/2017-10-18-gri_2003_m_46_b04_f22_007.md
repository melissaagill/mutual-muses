      but a charming yound girl! I think Clifford has done wonders with her.
      Janina rang up the other day and wanted to come over - but of course everyone was away.
      I am going to Bexhill with Clifford so I must start preparing tea and laying supper.
      Michael is a [unclear]ditchling[/unclear] until Saturday doing some sets for Georgie - I think I told you.
      My landscape progresses well, it is almost as green as a pre-Raphaelite! Desiree is going to sit for me on Saturday morning and Monday.
      My dearest Lawrence, I love you so much - I am so afraid of depending on you. Love me if you can - I love you. Sylvia
