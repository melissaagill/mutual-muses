      to say. We had a long post-script at the end dealing with abstract paintings

      a dozen charming school-girls, delectable in their enormous mufflers & vast
      striped knitted gloves. My landlady here, despite her name ([unclear]Una[/unclear])
      is terribly nice: she gave me dinner before I went and now I am eating a light
      supper & she has just told me I can have a bath. Luckily I do have to go to
      Hartlepool early tomorrow so I intend having a look at this celebrated town.\nI
      have added 40 lines to the poem and I have picked up the [unclear]eye[/unclear]
      image and described the factories in terms of [unclear]surgeries[/unclear] and
      also echoed the 'lemons of departure' by describing the industrial squalor as
      a nature morte. You remember that you read me a few lines of Baudelaire's [unclear]giantess
      [/unclear] sonnet? Without realising it until now I had been developing 'the
      exhalations of the giantess' (the wind in the first part of the poem) into several
      giantess images in the new section. The poem grows yet at the same time becomes
      self-supporting, as I hoped it would. Dearest Muse, my time, short as it was,
      with you still guides my hand.\nMy tour is half-way now. I continue dividing
      my time between the lectures, everlasting journeys, reading the Journal of the
      Courtauld and Warburg Institute & Antal on mannerism, seeing as much as I can

      1 XI 50 Evening
      This time my lecture was very successful, I am glad to say. We had a long post-script at the end dealing with abstract paintings which was very lively and I used the epidiascope. 65 people came to it, including a dozen charming school-girls, delectable in their enormous mufflers and vast striped knitted gloves. My landlady here, despite her [unclear]name ()[/unclear] is terribly nice: she gave me dinner before I went and now I am eating a light supper and she has just told me I can have a bath. Luckily I do not have to go to Hartlepool early tomorrow so I intend having a look at this celebrated town.

      I have added 40 lines to the poem and I have picked up the [unclear]ape[/unclear] image and desribed its factories in terms of surgeries and also echoed the '[unclear]demons[/unclear] of departure' by describing the industrial squalor as a [unclear][/unclear]. You remember that you read me a few lines of Baudelaire's giantess sonnet? Without realising it until now I had been developing 'the exhalations of the giantess' (the wind in the 1st part of the poem) into several giantess images in the new section. The poem grow yet at the same time becomes self-supporting, as I hoped it would. Dearest [unclear]muse[/unclear], my time, short as it was, with you still guides my hand.

      My tour is over half-way, now. I continue dividing my time between the lectures, everlasting journeys, reading the Journal of the [unclear]and Working Institute and Artal[/unclear] on mannerism, seeing as much as I can of each place, my poems, and last, but not, in the least, least writing to you my muse, my receptive love.

      I love you dearly and long for you
      Lawrence

      P.S.
      The '[unclear]animals[/unclear]' are nearly finished. They say so much is happening now that they want to stay up and see it for themselves and won't go to bed till another poem.
