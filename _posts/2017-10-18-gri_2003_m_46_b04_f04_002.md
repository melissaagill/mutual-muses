      1.iv.51
      Dearest Sylvia --
      How happy I am to have seen you again though sad
      to have lost you so soon. I do hope that you are
      feeling happy and creative -- despite M [unclear]who[/unclear] is a [unclear]avid[/unclear] of
      machine for making people guilty or tense. Your spring
      picture and Kissing will occupy your hard and creative
      energy, I hope, for a day or two. They are all very good.
      Your grand and handsome dress on Friday evening was
      superb: how well the grand style suits you. When I am
      rich you shall wear such dresses to paint in -- in
      surroundings as perfects as those described by Lionardo.
      He clearly had you in mind. Coucheries shall sing and play Dandy's poems to you; [unclear]and honour[/unclear] attentively will
      the night hushes fan you.
      I do not know how you can fear I do not love
      you. Hetty says it is obvious at a glance that I adore
      you and Lionel, whom I met for a moment last night,
      placed a paw on my arm as he enquired after you.
      Yawalla, of course, must not be left out, and he keeps
      rushing in with crumpled old envelopes & pieces of paper
      to tell Dandy that the post has come with lots of letters
      from Sylvia. Then he laughs and cries: 'this fool'.
      But Dandy became sad so Hetty sent Yawalla to
      apologise for this [unclear]quick[/unclear]. Sylvia, I adore you.

      Dearest Sylvia,
      How happy I am to have seen you again though sad to have left you so soon.  I do hope that you are feeling happy and creative - despite M [unclear]hes[/unclear] is a kind of machine for making people guilty or tense.  Your Spring picture and Kissing will occupy your hand and creative energy, I hope, for a day or two.  They are both very good.  Your grand and handsome dress on Friday evening was superb:  how well the grand style suits you.  When I am rich you shall wear such dresses to paint in - in surroundings as perfect as those described by Leonardo.  He clearly had you in mind.  [unclear]Coucheries[/unclear] shall sing and play Dandy's poems to you; owls hover attentively with the right brushes for you.

      I do not know how you can fear I do not love you.  Hetty says it is obvious at a glance that I adore you and Lionel, whom I met for a moment last night, placed a paw on my arm as he enquired after you.  Yawalla, of course, must not be left out, and he keeps rushing in with crumpled old envelopes or pieces of paper to tell Dandy that the post has come with lots of letters from Sylvia.  Then he laughs and cries: "April fool'.  But Dandy became sad so Hetty sent Yawalla to apologize for this trick.  Sylvia, I adore you.
