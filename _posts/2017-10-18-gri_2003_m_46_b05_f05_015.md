      7th May 1952
      Dearest Sylvia,
      Many happy returns of the day.  I shall think of you for
      every minute and we shall celebrate when you come to town.
      I wish we were together.  At least you will see the Woods
      who are returning on Thursday, I think.
      Ronald Firbank wrote a chapter in a book which consisted
      of the name 'Mabel!' exclaimed eight times because Mabel
      occupied a character's thoughts to the exclusion of everything
      else. So might I exclaim- 'Sylvia', not eight times
      merely, but over and over because you are me life.
      I am not sending news in this letter sentiments,
      desires, kisses.  I cannot think why you doubt my love.
      Let your birthday be marked, in the absence of solid gifts,
      at least by the conviction of my love = believe me, I am yours totally.  I adore you, I adore you.
      To celebrate the 8th I have got out several more of
      your paintings, on chairs and so on.  I wish you could
      see it.
      Once again- happy returns of the day.  We will cele-
      brate in person on Sunday. Remember-
      I adore you
      Lawrence
