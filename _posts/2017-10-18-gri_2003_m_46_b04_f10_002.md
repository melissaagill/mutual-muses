      Blackheath
      2 - October

      Dearest Sylvia
           Your letters are delightful and inspiring -- and with what fine drawings they are embellished. What a delicious creature [unclear]Wasily[/unclear] is, so elegant, industrious, and, when on her new garden-seat, how [unclear]wuggely[/unclear]!
           I know that your decision about Carol is not an easy one to make and I wondered if perhaps my advice to you -- against having her for X'mas -- was selfish. It is a complex situation but I am convinced that it is better, for you not to have her:  she would not really appreciate what you were doing for her & you would be rather tired.  I think the Woods have been (A) sentimental to adopt her in the 1st place & (B) irresponsible to drop her like this. But you are not placed in a way to really help Carol -- if, indeed, she can be helped. The Rectory has been for her a place to start from and not a home as such. In place of the struggle with an immature and chaotic girl you shall produce a painting, or paintings, which by this example will state your order & lovingness. Maximum expression of love & order would not have been possible in the Carol-for-Christmas (and for how long after) relation. It would have been a digression.
           Dandy has just bought a buff shirt -- plain, with long sleeves, & my usual long pointed collar. However, as always, it is too small so I shall have to return it this afternoon & get either a larger size or a different type.
           I have just heard from Miss Chick that I shall be away all next week & lecture -- not just the beginning and end of the week. I will let you know more details when I get them.
           Dandy trying on his shirt:
           Paul admired your Wyatt house -- Bilston -- Hampden --& Mrs. [unclear]Hahe's[/unclear] view -- watercolors enormously. He made a drawing later which (unconsciously) derived its composition from [unclearPerlston][/unclear]. Paul admitted it when I pointed it out.
           I love you I love you

      Your letters are delightful and inspiring - and with what fine drawings they are embellished. What a delicious character Wassily is, so elegant, industrious, and, when on her new garden-seat, how [unclear]wriggly[/unclear]!
      I know that you decision about Carol is not an easy one to make and I wondered if perhaps my advice to you - against having her for Xmas - was selfish. It is a complex situation but I am convinced that it is better for you not to have her: she would not really appreciate what you were doing for her & you would be rather tired. I thinks the Woods have been (A) sentimental to adopt her in the 1st place & (B) irresponsible to drop her like this. But you are not placed in a way to really help Carol - if, indeed, she can be helped. The Rectory has been for her a place to start from and not a home as such. In place of the struggle with an immature and chaotic girl you should produce a painting, or paintings, which by their example will state your order & lovingness. Maximum expression of love to order would have not been possible in the Carol-for-Christmas (and for how long after) relation. It would have been a digression.

      Dearest Sylvia
      Your letters are delightful and inspiring - and with what fine drawings they are embellished.  What a delicious creature [unclear]Wassily[/unclear] is, so elegant , industrious, and, when on her new garden-seat, how [unclear]wassely[/unclear]!

      I know that your decision about Carol is not an easy one to make and I wondered if perhaps my advice for you - against having her for X'mas - was selfish.  It is a complex situation but I am convinced that it is better for you not to have her: she would not really appreciate what you were doing for her & you would be rather tired.  I think the Woods have been (A) sentimental to adopt her in the 1st place & (B) irresponsible to drop her like this.  But you are not placed in a way to really help Carol - if, indeed, she can be helped.  The Rectory has been for her a place to start from and not a home as such.  In place of a struggle with an immature and [unclear]dootie[/unclear] girl you shall produce a painting, or paintings, which by their example will state your ardor & lovingness.  Maximum expression of line or ardor would not have been possible in the Carol-for-Christmas (and for how long after) relation.  It would have been a digression.

      Dandy has just bought a buff shirt - plain, with long sleeves, & my usual long pointed collar.  However, as always, it is too small so I shall have to return it this afternoon & get either a larger size or a different type.

      I have just heard from Miss [unclear]Click [/unclear] that I shall be away all next week on lectures - not just the beginning and end of the week.  I will let you know more details when I get them.

      Dandy trying on his shirt:

      Paul admired your Wyatt house - [unclear]Bailston[/unclear] - [unclear]Harpenden[/unclear] - by Mrs. [unclear]Hake's[/unclear] view - watercolors enormously.  He made a [unclear]draining[/unclear] late undid (unconscious) derived its composition from [unclear]Perlston[/unclear].  Paul admitted it when I pointed it out.

      I love you I love you

      Lawrence
