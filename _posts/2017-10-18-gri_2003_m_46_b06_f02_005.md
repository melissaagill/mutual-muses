    annotation_text: 'Les Jeux Interdits has been described as harrowing. I can see
      how people get this impression bu it is not the relevant reaction to the film.
      Death is conceived as a serious matter by most people and this leads, in England
      and America particularly, to a solemnity concerning it. The French, however,
      can make excellent jokes about it, as in L''Armeoire Volante. I should describe
      Les Jeux Interdits as an idyll. Death governs the action of the film, but as
      an exquisite game. Though it is obvious to an adult audience that the enchantment
      of the children''s game cannot last indefinitely, there is little hint of menace
      as the adult world infringes on their play. On the contrary, there is an extension
      of implication outwards from the children''s actions. Innocence is made the
      vehicle of satire of religion, the official form of death: from Paulette''s
      prayers as she buries the dog to the grubby hand groping for the after-cross,
      the mockery is unmistakable. Lyricism and pathos, reminiscent of Poil de Garrotte,
      is strong, of course, but the sound of French tradition of anti-clericalism
      operates in Les Jeux Interdits. The power of these children to subvert - unconsciously
      in the case of Haulette, mischievously in the case of Michael, who is older
      - the French Republic acts to spare an audience''s feelings from the physical
      facts of death. The spells of Paulette''s and Michael''s world, in which death
      is displaced from reality to play, is lyrically expressed - whispered words
      at night, gifts, thefts (a realistic version of attitudes expressed in Cocteau''s
