      Westerner: pocket Phaebus -
      a last say, as through tweed.

      Windows substitute for sun
      But who moves there is only too clear;
      No radiance pricks the eye.
      Diffuse in darkness I wait late.

      You will notice the fact the poet occupies a high place (significant in children's games and drawings) - equated with time and the sun. As light goes the office windows show up but the inhabitants are banal: no chance of their taking Phaebus' place in the sun-window. It is a megalomaniac - anti-social poem.

      I have been reading Empson's poems (as opposed to his prose recently) and admire it very much. He always seems (as a reviewer put it) to say less than he could - which makes a better impression than (like modern romantics) hoping to say more than you know.

      I love and adore you and anticipate happily your letter saying when you will come.

      love you

    clean_transcription: 'Westerner: pocket Phoebus - <br/>a last ray, as though tweed.<br/><br/>Windows
      substitute for sun<br/>But who moves there is only too clear;<br/>No radiance
      pricks the eye<br/>Diffuse in darkness I wait late.<br/><br/>You will notice
      the fact the poet occupies a high place (significant in childrens games & drawings)
      - equated with time and the sun. As light goes the office windows show up but
      the inhabitants are banal: no chance of this taking Phoebus'' place in the sun-window.
      It is a megalomaniac anti-social poem.<br/>I have been reading Empson''s poems
      (as opposed to his prose recently) & admire it very much. He always seems (as
      a reviewer put it) to say less than he could - which makes a better impression
      than (like modern romantics) hoping to say more than you know.<br/>Would you
      look up SNIDE in C''s Dictionary of American slang for me, please.<br/>I love
      and adore you & anticipate happily your letter saying when you will come.<br/>Love
      you<br/>Lawrence'
