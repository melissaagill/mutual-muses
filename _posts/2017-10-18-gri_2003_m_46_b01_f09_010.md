      Sylvia, dearest, your comment breaks my heart. Do not [unclear]find[/unclear] in this a fresh course for grief because it is rather a sign of my continuing love. At a time like this existentialist dogma may seem true but it is at times like this we can judge matters lest clearly. I wonder if this is not [unclear]the[/unclear] unconscious determining factor in Michael's condition about us not meeting when we are so close in geography. It makes me seem 'remote' though in fact I am not. Recognize this darling because though 'absence' leads to a sense of psychological separation the role of my absence is the one you ask of me. Do recognize this darling for it is imperative that you think about Michael's actions as well as suffer from them. Does not that [unclear]room[/unclear] , not very good in itself I admit, remind you of our bonds - I mean the one in my last letter [unclear]that[/unclear] one? I want to see you before you return to [unclear]Pelt[/unclear] long enough to re-assure you of my physical reality and my undiminished love. I leave the arrangement totally to you and I do not expect the opportunity to consummate - just to see you for a short while and talk, not [unclear]analytically[/unclear] or pleadingly, but just to say [unclear]things[/unclear] which may [unclear]soothe[/unclear] you.

      Sylvia, dearest, your torment breaks my heart. Do not find in this a fresh cause for grief because it is rather a sign of my continuing love.

I wonder if this is not the unconscious determin-ating factor in Michael's condition about us not meeting when we are so close in geography. It makes me seem 'remote' though in fact I'm not.

Do recognize this darling for it is imperative that you think about Michael's actions as well as suffer from them.

I want to see you before you return to Pett long enough to re-assure you of my physical reality and my un-diminished love I leave the arrangement totally to you and I do not expect the opportunity to consumate - just to see you for a short while and talk, not analytically or pleadingly, but just to say things which may soothe you.
