      Blackheath
      Tuesday

      Dearest Sylvia:

      Two letters came in this morning, much to my delight. I am glad about the Kensington Gallery: what reasonable terms, much better than the Portrait Society. Greenwich measures 24" X 18".

      I hope to see you on the 25th. Come in any case on that day if there is a sale or not: I long to see you, as you can imagine.

      Alas, the wind last night blew the smaller begonia off the window ledge. I have brought the others in but I am not sure if I can save the fallen one or not. I have replanted it and I will tell you how it looks in my next letter.

      Tell Tiny that Hetty is only to happy to shop, especially for materials! I shall wear some of the finery I have on in the portrait she likes.

      My unwell feeling has quite gone: I think I had drunk something which disagreed with my but which felt terribly like a prelude to flu.

      I am very amused at the two reviews of The Salesman Named Desire or Death of a Streetcar, whichever it is. I know you have to Mirror, sharing it with the Woods, but how did you come by The Times? The Times review seems to have been written by a woman - don't you think?

      I fear you would be blown away today if the weather at Hastings is like the weather here so no Railway bridge painting I imagine.

      Tuesday

      Dearest Sylvia:

      Two letters came this morning, much to my delight. I am glad about the Kensington Gallery: What reasonable terms,  much better than the Portrait Society. Greenwich measures 24 x 18ins.
      I hope to see you on the 25th. Come in any case on that day if there is a sale or not: I long to see you, as you can imagine.

      Alas, the wind last night blew the smaller begonia off the window ledge. I have brought the others in but  I am not sure if I can save the fallen one or not. I have replanted it and I will tell you how it looks in my next letter.

      Tell Tiny that Hetty is only too happy to shop, especially for materials: I shall wear some of the finery I have on in the portrait she likes.

      My unwell feeling has quite gone: I think I had  drunk something which disagreed with me but which felt terribly like a prelude to 'flu'.

      I am very amused at the two reviews of  The Salesman Named Desire or Death of a Streetcar, whichever it is. I know you have the Mirror, sharing it with the Woods, but how did you come by the Times? The Times review seems to have been written by a woman - don't you think?

      Tell Tiny that Hetty is only to happy to shop, especially for materials! I shall wear some of the finery I have on in the portrait she likes.
