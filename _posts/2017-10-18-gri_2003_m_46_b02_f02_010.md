      Dearest Sylvia
      Thank you so much for your letters.  This morning's contained good news of your painting.  I am happy about this.
      Today at the BM I have been reading an C1819 classical dictionary with illustrations [unclear]by[/unclear] Hogarth.  It is charming - and, of course, important, putting H in the southern tradition.
      Last night my father took me to dinner (roast turkey - reminding me of Woverhampton) and to see PAISA - which was unexpectedly good.
      By the way - it might be a good idea to get a reader's ticket for the B.M. before you come to town.  What you need to do is send a letter of recommendation [unclear]to[/unclear] the Librarian, B.M., London about your 'character' and a note from yourself saying what you want to study.

      4th February 1949

      Dearest Sylvia

          Thank you so much for your letters.  This morning's contained good news of your painting.  I am happy about this.

          Today at the B M I have been reading an C18th classical dictionary with illustrations by Hogarth.  It is charming - and, of course, important, putting it in the southern tradition.

          Last night my father took me to dinner (roast turkey - reminding me of Wolverhampton) and to see Paisa - which was unexpectedly good.

          By the way - it might be a good idea to get a reader's ticket for the B. M. before you come to town.  What you need to do is send a letter of recommendation to the Librarian, B. M. , London about your clarades and a note from yourself saying what you want to study.  Clifford would be a good person for the first letter (it will in no way imperil his living):  If you used Solmon you'd have to see
