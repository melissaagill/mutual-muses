      on with a wall & a second lot of windows - it is a bit oppressive as a result.

      on the Zoo-side of the park.\n   My father brought me two pairs of nice & restrained
      nylon re-enforced socks, milk chocolate, & 1 lb of butter.  He liked Paris enormously
      and enjoyed it more than the seaside to my (& his own) surprise.\n   Mandy &
