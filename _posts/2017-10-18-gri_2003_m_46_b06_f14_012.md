      do it straight away - if these were convenient to you.
      I do look forward to the completed "Elegy for 2 Uncles" - what I have seen is so good, and full of wonderful subtle meanings! I adore your poems - and want more!
      What long letters I write, full of [unclear] instructions [/unclear] I'm afraid!
      I do believe you love me, but I'm afraid, at present, at any rate it is in a very un-ecstatic way! I'm afraid I'm very demanding - but I do love you so passionately, you are still an exciting experience to me - even after all these years! The truth is of course that I have bored everyone stiff with my show! Thank God when its over! The Woods are most good and kind - and do thank them if you have a moment!
      The trouble is we've noticed it with their other friends - They like to be the sun round which we revolve in almost fatal attraction - we mustn't start - or remain involved in one another!

      I love you
      Sylvia
