      3 inside of a week - I think I
      shall make it the 8th because of
      the Bank holiday; But do let
      me know if some other date suits
      your better as I want to fit in
      and to come when I can see the
      most of you.  Aunt Margaret is
      coming on the 21st of August - as
      I think I told you.
      By the way if you should go to
      Catford, could you get me a wall
      shad, such as you have, from that
      art shop - I need it for Andray's room - I should be so grateful if
      you would.
      On second thoughts I might come on the 7th as I should come
      by train and you have to deliver
      my water-colours on that day,
      so it would be easier for you
      to meet me, but let me know
      your opinion.

      3 inside of a week. I think I shall make it the 8th because of the Bank holiday; But do let me know if some other date suits you better as I want to fit in and come when I can see the most of you. Aunt Margaret is coming on the 21st of August - as I think I told you.
      By the way if you should go to Catford, could you get me a wall shade, such as you have, from that [unclear] Ant [/unclear] Shop - I need it for Audrey's room - I should be so grateful if you would.
      On second thoughts I might come on the 7th as I should come by train and you have to deliver my water-colours on that day, so it would be easier for you to meet me, but let me know your opinion.
