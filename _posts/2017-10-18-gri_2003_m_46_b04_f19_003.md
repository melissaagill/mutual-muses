      SYLVIA SLEIGH (stationary heading)


      I hope that you slept well - I imagine that you are still fast asleep - I hope so for I'm afraid you did not get enough while you were here.
           I shall think of you at the Hogworth Exhibition - don't forget Blairman - and to see that Hogworth at that private gallery.  Tell me the low-down on Madge! - the latest!
           I don't think I shall be able to paint in the garden as I think it will be much too wet.  So I shall do housework and gardening today - and lead the Burlington.

      I hope that you slept well-
      I imagine [unclear]that[/unclear] you are still
      fast asleep- I hope so for
      I'm afraid you did not
      get enough while you were here.

      I shall think of you at
      the Hogarth exhibitions-
      don't forget [unclear]Blairmen[/unclear]-
      and to see that Hogarth
      at that private gallery.
      Tell me the low-down or

      I don't think I shall
      be able to paint in the

      will be much too wet.
      So I shall do housework and
