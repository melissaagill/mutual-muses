      Thursday Wimbledon

      Dearest Sylvia
      As you may have heard from Clifford and Marjorie (whom I met in the Vega yesterday accidentally) I spent the night at Wimbledon. The mother was unpleasant and, in any case, I wanted the trays. Unfortunately my mother is still only willing to part with one of them - and I have reluctantly accepted this condition.
      The subject of my lecture next week will be 'Connaisseurship and Appreciation' - I hope it will not be too familiar to you. Your splendid eye for pictures will perhaps be patient in the cause of love. I have worked out a syllabus with the [unclear]clars[/unclear]. Only ten pupils so far but I expect it will go up. [unclear]Stupick[/unclear] the W E A have arranged Architecture lectures by Helen [unclear]Roseram[/unclear] for the same night!
      I feel tired and lazy today so I think I shall not do any work today but start a new chapter [unclear]to[/unclear] - [unclear]warrant[/unclear].
      Edward (whose flat I went to the other night) [unclear]Laofjurt[/unclear] returned from from France. He had been to Coleman and [unclear]Nancy[/unclear]. I was very envious and felt sure you would be, too. I thought of you very hard - especially when the conversation turned to the Rugby Pavilion.

      Thursday Wimbledon
      Dearest Sylvia
      As you may have heard from Clifford and Marjorie(whom I met in the [unclear]Vega[/unclear] yesterday accidentally) I spent the night at Wimbledon. The weather was unpleasant and, in any case, I wanted the [unclear]Crays[/unclear]. Unfortunately my mother is still only willing to part with one of them - and I have reluctantly accepted this condition.
      The subject of my lecture next week will be 'connoisseurship and appreciation'- I hope it will not be too familiar to you. Your splendid eye for pictures will perhaps be patient in the cause of love. I have worked out a syllabus with the class. Only ten pupils so far but I expect it will go up. Stupidly the W.E.A have arranged Architecture lectures by Helen [unclear] Rosenam[/unclear] for the same night!
      I fell tired and lazy today so I think I shall not do any work today but start a new chapter tomorrow.
      Edward (whose flat I went  to the other night ) had just returned from France. He had been to [unclear]Cale**as[/unclear] and Nancy. I was very envious and felt sure you would be , too. I thought of you very hard -especially when the conversation turned to the  Brighton Pavillion . Somebody there suggested Follies as a subject for a [unclear] King [/unclear] Penguin

    clean_transcription: Thursday Wimbledon<br/>Dearest Sylvia<br/>As you may have
      heard from Clifford and Marjorie(whom I met in the Vega yesterday accidentally)
      I spent the night at Wimbledon. The weather was unpleasant and, in any case,
      I wanted the Crays. Unfortunately my mother is still only willing to part with
      one of them - and I have reluctantly accepted this condition.<br/>The subject
      of my lecture next week will be 'connoisseurship and appreciation'- I hope it
      will not be too familiar to you. Your splendid eye for pictures will perhaps
      be patient in the cause of love. I have worked out a syllabus with the class.
      Only ten pupils so far but I expect it will go up. Stupidly the W.E.A have arranged
      Architecture lectures by Helen  Rosenam for the same night!<br/>I fell tired
