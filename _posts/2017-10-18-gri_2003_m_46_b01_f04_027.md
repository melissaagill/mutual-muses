      Really, my dear, I think you are being altogether too slack with your owls.  You give them too many circuses. They seem almost recalcitrant about my lecture.  Well, I wrote out most of the lecture before hand and also a skeleton of the main points I wished to make.  Had them all in my pocket but didn't use them once.

      With regard to your slides.  It's no good choosing them before I go to Pett, as you seem to imply, because they may be out when the time comes.  If Michael sends me home before the lecture I could get them.  Otherwise I don't see what I can do but if I've missed the point tell me and I'll do what you say.  As you know I won't only to help.  They are only allowed out for a week after all.

      This afternoon I send off the Phaidon Press Titian.  I got it from the Reference Library at Fulhma: I borrowed it.  The librarian gave me special concessions very kindly though I don't know why as I didn't see him, or plead my case.  It must go back however on the 25th of June as a month is the longest they would allow.  Oh, and they believe it is out to Dennis Simmons for his tickets are the only London ones I have.  Still what's a little forgery.  I had to fill a form you see.

      No, I didn't know Merciless Beauty but it sounds good and I adore you for finding The Gordian Knot.  I have to stop now as I have some shopping to do but in my nest letter I will start where this finished, with your quotations which are delightful.  I do want to talk about them.

      I love you.

      I have eaten all my sweets.  No war.  Am heartbroken and have indigestion.

      I adore you.

      Lawrence

      Really, my dear, I think you are being altogether too
      slack with your owls. You give them too many circuses.
      They seem almost recalcitrant about my lecture. Well, I
      wrote out most of the lecture before hand and also a skele-
      ton of the main points I wished to make. Had them all
      in my pocket but didn't use them once.

      With regard to your slides. It's no good choosing them
      before I go to Pett, as you seem to imply, because they may
      be out when the time comes. If Michael sends me home be-
      fore the lecture I could get them. Otherwise I don't see
      what I can do but if I've missed the point tell me and I'll
      do what you say. As you know I won't only to help.
      They are only allowed out for a week after all.

      This afternoon I sent off the Phaidon Press Titian.
      I got it from the Reference Library at Fulhma: I bor-
      rowed it. The librarian gave me special concessions
      very kindly though I don't know why as I didn't see him
      or plead my case. It must go back however on the 25th
      of June as a month is the longest they would allow. Oh,
      and they believe it is out to Dennis Simmons for his tic-
      kets are only London ones I have. Still what's a lit-
      tle forgery. I had to fill a form you see.

      No, I didn't know Merciless Beauty but it sounds good
      and I adore you for finding The Garden Knot. I have
      to stop now as I have some shopping to do but in my next
      letter I will start where this finished, with your quota-
      tions which are delightful. I do want to talk about
      them.

      I love you.

      I have eaten all my sweets. No war. Am heartbroken
      and have indigestion.

      I adore you.
