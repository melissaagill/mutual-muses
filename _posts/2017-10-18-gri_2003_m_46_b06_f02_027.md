      [11-2-53] Dearest Sylvia,
      Thank you for your letters. I must say at once,
      though it may seem unconvincing in a letter, that
      you should worry less. I do love you. I think
      that the anxiety of your approaching exhibition
      must help place everything in a tense
      perspective for you - so that lions become
      distracted and the customary importance of small
      things and large is exchanged.

      I am so pleased that you are getting on with
      the framing. It is rather a business but I am
      sure you will do it well, for your craftman-
      ship is now excellent in the matter of framing.
      Oh - goddamn - I have come out without mea-
      suring Tiny Tots! I am sorry. I will give you
      the measurements in my next letter. I do
      hope that will be convenient.

      Dearest Sylvia,
      Thank you for your letters. I must say at once,
      though it may seem unconvincing in a letter, that
      you should worry less. I do love you. I think
      that the anxiety of your approaching exhibition
      must help place everything in a tense
      perspective for you - so that lions become
      distorted and the customary importance of small
      things and large is exchanged.
      I am so pleased that you are getting on with
      the framing. It is rather a business but I am
      sure you will do it well, for your craftsman-
      ship is now excellent in the matter of framing.
      Oh - goddamn - I have come out without mea-
      suring Tiny Tots! I am sorry.  I will give you
      the measurements in my next letter. I do
      hope that will be convenient.
