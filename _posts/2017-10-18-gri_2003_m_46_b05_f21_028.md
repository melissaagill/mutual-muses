      7.
      picture for which you did start writing a poem - the rhyme more seems most irregular - but very pleasing and effective I think. You must read me some more of your work and bring some poems when you come. Have you thought any more of the Venetian play?
      Come as soon as you can on Thursday. Let me know how long you can stay.
      I love you, my sweetheart, I adore you, and think of you all the time.
      I love you
