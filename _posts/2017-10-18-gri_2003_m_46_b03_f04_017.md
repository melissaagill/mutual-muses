      has ended in .... what.<br/>My light lecture began, I think, rather poorly but
      got better & better and I ended feeling masterful - a real dandy. the people
      said how much they like it. I discovered things about the Catenodesign which
      I''ll tell you before it  one day ... and discussed Baroque use of light in

      I found Charles'' book and read the popeschapters - quite good really, sound
