      By the way Tiny said to manhood how strange it was that [unclear]Hoddins [/unclear] didn't get your book out and he said not at all - it was (the Burserie) a tax evation ad advertising stunt. they didn't care whether the book was published or not - so you'd better go and see whats happening soon - for if you're not interested they won't be.
      I shall go to bed now I am very tired - I had horrid night-mares (Beckman-like) and slept badly.
      I love you so much
      I love you
