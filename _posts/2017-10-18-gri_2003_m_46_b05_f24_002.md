      I re read your Dufy article and liked it very much - I haven't read your one on on the Kensington show - I'm shy about it!
      I am most amused by your description of Charles' place - and Roberts' apparent intelligent worldliness! I can well under-stand your feelings and it places Charles "friends" beautifully
      I have just had a caller (both the Woods are out)
