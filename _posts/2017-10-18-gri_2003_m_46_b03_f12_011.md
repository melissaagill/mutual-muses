      Pett 25.5.50
      Dearest Lawrence,
      What a delight to have a letter from you so
      soon, and so well illustrated. I wish I had your
      lecture and am longing to hear of the light, and
      if your discovery is the Catena design. I did not
      mention to you how very nice you looked - but
      you did - with an exquisitely tied bow!
      I enclose the 'Bonnard' ticket. I see it is until
      10.30 not 11.30 as I wrote! I must go to Berthe
      Morisot on my return. I shall just have time.
      Michael is coming up with his pictures on Saturday next
      to put it in to the Observer Exhibition - he will see
      it then.
      The garden here is very luscious owing to all the rain
      the apple blossom is almost over - but the laburnum is
      still in bloom, and the rhododendrons have surpassed
      themselves and are a glowing pink-mauve mass.
      This afternoon M bought a very nice very small
      Georgian portrait in a carved frame for a £ it is
      in the style of Morland, a rather red-faced man
      well drawn and solid - rather thickly painted.
      He hopes to make something on it - he thought he might
      try sending it to Christies.
      I feel terribly tired as I am not well -
      though I have not done much - we are going off early
      to-morrow morning - my address will be
      c/o Mrs Margaret Hicks
