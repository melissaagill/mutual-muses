      In The Bus

      Dearest Sylvia,
      I have been [unclear]rather[/unclear] [unclear]rusled[/unclear] with my
      lecture but I am sending this note
      (there will be a proper paper letter to-
      morrow) about you coming
      to town. I have some money
      at the moment so, of course,
      you must come.

      I think that in some ways Sunday morning
      would be best because I shall [unclear]have[/unclear]
      [unclear]...[/unclear] 3 lectures on Saturday! I can
      dust and tidy on Sunday morning
      then for you. But if you would
      prefer Sat. let me know and I will meet
      whatever train you decide on,
      either day
      More tomorrow - I long to see you
      I love you
