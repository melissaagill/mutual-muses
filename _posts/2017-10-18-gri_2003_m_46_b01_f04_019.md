      Sunday

      Dearest Sylvia:

      I hope your journey was a pleasant one; as pleasant as possible in the 'bus, tired as you were.  I hope, too, you had a good night's rest.  What a pity today that we can't sunbathe and be united in Phoebus' rays.  I'm sure some sun is just what architecture students require, after examinations.  Rain drips here in two tempos" quick and lively and continual on the leaves in the front garden, heavy and grave in the drops from the eaves.

      Poetry has not welcomed me back yet.  You are still tired, my Muse told me, come back when you've had a good rest.  I shall do so, and, for the present, prose must suffice.

      In a little while I am going to go to Putney and see La Belle et la Bete and I shall think of you all the time.

      Last evening I tried to get the two poems you told me about but I was unsuccessful but I shall not forget and will find them soon you can be sure.

      Have you read MacCarthy in the Sunday Times today?  The 17th century, he ventures, whatever you say, 'was the flowering-time of Religion in English poetry.'  'It was', he goes on to say, 'the age of Donne, Herbert, Crawshaw, Vaughan, Milton'.  While we have critics with MacCarthy's original gifts we shan't harm, shall we???

      I am so happy because you love me, so happy despite all the material obstacles.  I love you, Sylvia.  Perhaps this declaration is lacking in subtlety and elegance but with a typewriter you can't very well change what you put down and in any case I want to leave it just as it is.  I Love You.

      I have to stop because tea is clattering nearer but I shall write again shortly, dearest.

      Sunday

      Dearest Sylvia:

         I hope your journey was a pleasant one;  as pleasant as possible in the 'bus, tired as you were.  I hope, too, you had a good night's rest.  What a pity today that we can't sunbathe and be united in Phoebus' rays.  I'm sure some sun is just what architecture students require, after examinations.  Rain drips here in two tempos:  quick and lively and continual on the leaves in the front garden, heavy and grave in the drops from the eaves

      Poetry has not welcomed me back yet.  You are still tired, my Muse told me, some back when you've had a good rest.  I shall do so, and for the present, prose must suffice.

      In a little while I am going to go to Putney and La Belle et al Bete and I shall think of you all the time.

      Last evening I tried to get the two poets you told me about but I was unsuccessful but I shall not forget and will find them soon you can be sure.

      Have you read MacCarthy in the Sunday Times to-day.  The 17th century, he ventures, whatever you say, 'was the flowering-time of Religion in Eng-lish poetry.'  'It was' He goes on to say 'the age of Donne, Herbert, Cranshaw, Vaughan, Milton'.  While we have critics with MacCarthy's original gifts we shan't harm, shall we???

      I am so happy because you love me, so happy des-pite all the material obstacles.  I love you, Sylvia.  Perhaps this declaration is lacking in subtlty and elegance but with a typewriter you can't very well change what you put down and in any case I want to leave it just as it is.  I Love You.

      I have to stop because tea is clattering nearer but I shall write again shortly, dearest.

      Wimbledon

      Sunday

      Dearest Sylvia:

      I hope your journey was a pleasant one; as pleasant as possible in the 'bus, tired as you were. I hope, too, you had a good night's rest. What a pity today that we can't sunbathe and be united in Phoebus' rays. I'm sure some sun is just what architecture students require, after examinations. Rain drips here in two tempos: quick and lively and continual on the leaves in the front garden, heavy and grave in the drops from the eaves.

      Poetry has not welcomed me back yet. You are still tired, my Muse told me, come back when you've had a good rest. I shall do so, and, for the present, prose must suffice.

      In a little while I am going to go to Putney and see La Belle et la Bete and I shall think of you all the time.

      Last evening I tried to get the two poets you told me about but I was unsuccessful but I shall not forget and will find them soon you can be sure.

      Have you read MacCarthy in the Sunday Times to-day. The 17th century, he ventures, whatever you say, 'was the flowering time of Religion in English poetry.' 'It was' he goes on to say 'they age of Donne, Herbert, Crawshaw, Vaughan, Milton'. While we have critics with MacCarthy's original gifts we shan't harm, shall we???

      I am so happy because you love me, so happy despite all the material obstacles. I love you, Sylvia. Perhaps this declaration is lacking in subtlety and elegance but with a typewriter you can't very well change what you put down and in any case I want to leave it just as it is. I Love You.

      I have to stop because tea is clattering [unclear]neares[/unclear] but I shall write again shortly, dearest.

      Lawrence

      Here dandylion is at tea - a little [unclear]that you'll mature[/unclear].
