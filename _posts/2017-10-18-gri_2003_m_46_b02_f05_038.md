      II

      SYLVIA IN THE ORCHARD

      Medallions of light
      Start through the foliage
      Likenesses of Apollo

      Like chiffon at your throat
      The blossom curls and crinkles

      Your blossom is the frontispiece
      Of a summer full of fruit
      Of poems ripened in the sun
      Falling into baskets of rhymes

      Nervous and felicitous
      Your blossom lies on the page
      Like the blossom on the sky

      Anthologist of beauty

      (I wrote that with your new painting at my hand. It is a lovely addition to my collection.)
