      26 @ December
      Dear Sylvia,
      Sorry. I wrote a letter to you on Monday but failed to post it. Part of my Christmas Protest, I suppose. Anyway I expect you will have heard from Toynbee by now. I had a note from the Registrar in which he said he was hoping to fix up a meeting with you. Major Ellis, remember, is the highest-up, but Vanstone is the vigorous organiser with his finger on the pulse of the Common Heart. Do ring me if I've neglected anything you want to know.
      I'm looking forward to coming on the 1st. What train do you recommend?
      Yours sincerely,
      Lawrence
