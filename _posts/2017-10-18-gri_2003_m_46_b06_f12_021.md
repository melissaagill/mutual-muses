      8.25 -
      8.35 10.48
      Dearest Sylvia
      I plan to catch the 8.25 from Charing X on Friday morning - which gets me in to Hastings at 10.45. ( I can catch it at London Bridge at 8.35 - giving me 3 or 4 more minutes sleep in the morning.)
      I am busy correcting [unclear]Bansteads'[/unclear] homework now: they are getting too eager - almost too MANY now, after a slow start. (On the way home I have a science-fiction book by a lady to read. I wonder if it will be different to male science-fiction?)
      Longing to see you, my love. I live for Friday. see you in the station: I'll wait if I'm first.
      Love you
      Lawrence
