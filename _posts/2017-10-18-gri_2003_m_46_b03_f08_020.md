      Blackheath                   9th September 1950
      Dearest Sylvia
      I was so happy to have your letter this morning and though I am a tiny bit behind time I must reply to you. I am going to Brighton, I heard yesterday evening, and am meeting Bernard at Victoria at11:30. It is nearly 10:30...
      My Polydor poem is finished but not yet typed but I will send you a copy as soon as possible - I have nearly half of the temptation poem finished. No, the cubist article requires some more reading, so I have not added to it, but nor have I forgotten it.
      I am glad you are progressing with the portrait and the landscape- and I look forward to news of their completion.
      Veronese is quite my favorite artist this week - and Colbert about his mannerist and High Renaissance com-pound, his reconciliation of classical geometry and (16th symmetry and contrapposto. I enjoyed it very well.
      I have been reading lots of Apollinaire - he is mag-nificent- I suppose he is my next influence.
