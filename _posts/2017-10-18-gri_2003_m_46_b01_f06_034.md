I'm so glad you liked my poems or, I ought to say, your poems as they are for you and about you.  Alas, I did not hear Hindemith or Wolf on the Third programme.

You are intending, I see, to dazzle everyone and I think it's a good idea: I hope when you come to town I shall see it on .. please.
      By all means keep The Rectory umbrella & the other things: I don't require them at present and I like to think of you looking at them sometimes.  Don't you think Tennyson's Two Voices funny also?  I am glad Lines has not forgotten & in case he doesn't write could you let me have his address at the Art School?  Just in case.

      Monday

          Thank you for your letter. I am glad to have news of your painting; How I wish I covered the  every stage of it.  I'm so glad you liked my poems as, I ought to say, your poems as they are for you and about you.  Alas, I did not hear Mindemill as Wolf on the Third programme.  I forgot completely about them . . . "Fireweed" is a charming name for nail-varnish: is it as strong a color as the name suggests.  You are intending, I see, to dazzle Europe and I think it's a good idea; I hope when you come to town I shall see it on.  please.  By all means keep the Rectory umbrella by the other things:  I don't require them at present and I like to think of your looking at them sometimes.  Don't you think Tennyson's Two Voices funny also?  I am glad Lindy has not forgotten & in case he doesn't write could you let have his address at the Art School>  Just in case.

          I have to settle down and read Addisons 11 essays on Imagination today and shall do so when I stop writing.  Hey Ho!

      I love you, darling,
