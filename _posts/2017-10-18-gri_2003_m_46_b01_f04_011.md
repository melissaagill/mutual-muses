Poor son - commited but carefully used I think it will be possible to discount (mothers) fears about Mrs Greenwood and I easing Miss Sleigh into the dominant place.

      I have ( about ) upstairs ( The [unclear] is occupied ) and your Pett picture is before me. In a way I think, you have re-acted here against one of the consequences of recession and what goes into recession - looking into it, the first pencil sketches - sometimes disregarded later, the delicious sliding of one color into another, I feel very vividly your personality [unclear][/unclear]unclear] - But I'm supposed to be an art critic and I can only say in my official role I am the picture's victims rather than its possessor. It seems to me such a lot to say as a picture that is both delicate and bold that I can honestly say it as this.
