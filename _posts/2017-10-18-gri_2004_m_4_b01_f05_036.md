      I have read.  Does Clifford like it?  Today I have bought a new book - an illustrated
      life of Christ which will instruct even this pagan lion!  It costs 12s 6d but
      Father got it for 9s 3d!  (I haven't paid him yet!)<br/><br/>You fill me with
      happiness, and arrogant feelings of success overwhelm me.  I believe I can do
      anything that you wish - my muse, my rose.<br/>Let me know, if you can, by Thursday
      post what train you will catch on Saturday.  I shall come back from Birmingham
      in the morning so can meet you where and when you say.  Come in time to get
      back to Blackheath for last minute shopping if you can in the afternoon.<br/>Redcar
      dates are 8th - 15th December (and I go to Skegness in March).<br/><br/>Dearest
      love, precious beauty, I may write no more now.  I love you my marvellous muse,<br/>I
      love you<br/>Lawrence

           I am glad your slides are satisfactory.  Charles has lent me 4, and tomorrow is going to get the courtauld to give me some more, so I shall be alright.  I am making VAST preparatory notes for the David - I shall soon be on an ex-pert lion on him.
