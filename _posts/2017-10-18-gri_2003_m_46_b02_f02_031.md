      I have got another school lecture - on Saturday morning at 11:30. I am to talk about the Italians - I am sure you can guess the ones I shall choose. I think I will try and do what Rosenau told me she did recently - take the theme of triumph and show how the artists have handled it.

      I await news of your composition - is it an 'Historical Picture'? - with great excitement. The promise of a shelter pleases me enormously - but if you don't have time I shall understand.

      I have been reading Joan Evans' Taste and Temperament and have decided that there are 5 psychological types; quick introvert, quick extrovert, slow intro., slow extra., and ME. I seem to fit none of her pigeon holes!

      Now I am off to buy my socks.

      I hope you are well, and not too busy and I hope absence is not separating us much. I long to meet you...Sylvia - I love you Lawrence
