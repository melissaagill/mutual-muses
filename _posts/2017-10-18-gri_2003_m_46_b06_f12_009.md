      PAINTING 2
      tures of exisential individulism, lose as a reflective work
      than as an anguished act with paint and canvas. Jackson Pol-
      lock influenced some of these artists. In Paris this attitude
      to creation was expressed by Jean-Paul Riopolle, Georges Mathieu,
      Henri Michaux, and others. In England, the most conspicuous
      exponents of this anti-formal art were Alan Davie and Gerald Wilde.
      The 'aformal' artists considered most modern art manneristic.
      Modern German painting supported their view: though there was a
      great deal of German painting to be seen in 1953, most of it was
      either oriented to the recent past or rather superficially deriv-
      ative from other countries. Influences of the pre-war Bauhaus
      and post-war Paris conflict: though the Germans were free to
      experiment, no recognisable national style, comperable to that of the
      pre-Nazi years, emerged. Even Karl Hofer's recent work
      lacked the admirable purposefulness and strength of his earlier
      painting.
      There were many other aesthetic attitudes in Europe in 1953,
      besides the individualism of the 'aformalists' and the selecticism
      of the Germans. Typical of post-war aesthetics (in some quarters)
      is the narrowing-down of modern art. For example, the Eccle d'Aix -
      a group of artists led by Pierre Tal Coat, gathered like pilgrims
      round the cave-mouth at Bibemus. Faces with their misty abstractred
      scenes the question arose: was this a consolidation of a position
      won years ago, or was Cezanne's real achievement being dissipated
      by a decadent excess of refinement? Late Euston Road realists in
      England suggested similar doubts.

      Painting 2
      tures of existential individualism, less as a reflective work than as an anguished act with paint and canvas. Jackson Pollock
      influenced some of these artists. In Paris this attitude
      to creation was expressed by Jean-Paul Riopelle, Georges Mathieu,
      Henri Michaux, and others. In England, the most conspicuous
      exponents of this anti-formal art were Alan Davie and Gerald Wilde.

      The 'aformal' artists considered most modern art manneristic.
      Modern German painting supported their view: though there was a great deal of German painting to be seen in 1953, most of it was either oriented to the recent past or rather superficially derivative from other countries. Influences of the pre-war Bauhaus and post-war Paris conflict: though the Germans were free to experiment, no recogznisable national style, comparable to that of the pre-Nazi years, emerged. Even Karl Hofer's recent work lacked the admirable purposefulness and strength of his earlier painting.

      There were many other aesthetic attitudes in Europe in 1953, besides the individualism of the 'aformalists' and the eclecticism of the Germans. Typical of post-war aesthetics (in some quarters) is the narrowing-down of modern art. For example, the Ecole d'Aix - a group of artists let by Pierre Tal Coat, gathered like pilgrims round the cave-mouth at Bibemus. Faced with their misty abstracted scenes the question arose: was this a consolidation of a position won years ago, or was Cenzanne's real achievement being dissipated by a decadent excess of refinement? Late Euston Road realists in England suggested similar doubts.
