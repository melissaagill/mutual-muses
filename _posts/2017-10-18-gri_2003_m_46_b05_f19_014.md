      Dearest Lawrence,
      It has just struck 2 o'clock
      and I have just finished my lunch
      and am wasting for the kettle to
      boil to do my washing up.  I suppose
      if you withstood the journey you will
      be half-way through your lecture to
      the school.  I do hope you felt better
      during the journey and not worse.
      I am so sorry that you should have
      been ill. I hope you felt well
      enough to have alight lunch at
      the Vega.  I wonder if you traveled
      past of the way altogether.  I shall
      hope to hear from you soon as I
      shall be worried about you.
      Soon after you had all gone
      Mrs. Hake called which was very
      pleasant.  She brought masses of
