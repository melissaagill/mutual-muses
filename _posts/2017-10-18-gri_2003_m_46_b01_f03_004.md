      experience is possibly material for poetry but I am too much its victim at present.

      I went on the river on Thursday. Became pinker than ever. I was reminded continually of Berthe Morisot and Mary Cassatt in the way the river curls away above and beyond the shoulders of the oarsman when one is sitting int he stern steering. A weir, a swan, two girls running by the river, than only the sad willows and the sun going in and out rapidly: Proust.

      It is Molly's birthday soon - on the 6th. She insists I am not to spend any money on her but write a poem as I did last year. That's very pleasing. I shall try but, of course, you do dominate me poetically.

      I shall send you your poems in a day or two. There is a little revision to do first. I feel impelled to do this despite the delay it [unclear]causes[/unclear]. You, Muse, will understand the necessity for this.

      Johnson who saw me yesterday was very nice except that he was a bore, oh, what a bore. He made four drawings of the flowers you sent him. I am inclined to be cutting about this. I have already put his promiscuous action into a poem. Whether I shall leave it there I must decide shortly.

      To close I want to quote from Swift who is quoted in Books In General this week in the Old Statesman: 'I wish my cold hand was in the warmest place about you..'

      (Incidentally I apologize for the English of the Cauguin translation but that's Van Wyck Brooks not me.)

      I love you.
