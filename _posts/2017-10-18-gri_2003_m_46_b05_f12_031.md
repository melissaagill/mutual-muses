      London [11-12-52]

      Dearest Sylvia
      Your letter dated 6th came only yesterday.
      I am sorry you need to go to Georgie's on Friday but I do understand. The Saturday school lecture I had has been cancelled so I will meet what - ever train you decide on.
      I don't think I need any tea - but it was sweet of you to suggest it.
      I love your sketch of the new indeed - I am most impressed that Tiny considers it a good likeness - for she is most critical on that point. (It is high time you did justice to yourself in paint, my love.)
      Tonight is my social evening with the Johnsons - Penrner's lecture, dinner, a movie.
      I am so excited to be seeing you again so soon - It is nearly Saturday.
      I love you I adore you
      Lawrence
