      three
      This is the Mayor of..Hello, are you there.
      Could I speak to the Minister, please.
      This is the Mayor of South Eiderdown.
      Good morning, sir, good morning, yes.
      I'll come to the point.
      The people of this city need
      Relief from tax.  The tax is high.
      The people of this city plead...
      I see.  Thank you, sir.  Good bye.
      CROWD:  Well, what did he say?
      What did the minister say.
      MAYOR:  He said it is out of this hands.
      He said he is in the same boat.
      He said he would help if he could
      And suggests that you go to the King.
      He suggests an audience with the King.
      CROWD:  With the King.  An audience with the King.
      AGITATOR:  Yes, the King.  You must arrange it.
      Ring up the palace.  Ring up the palace.
      (Reluctantly the Mayor starts to dial.  The camera pans
      to another part of the market place where the Travel
      Agent is with the Princess.)
      IN ONE PLACE
      TRAVEL AGENT:  Though I may be expert
      On travel abroad
      And know all the import-
      and places you've heard
      About at school and in the movies
      It is at home and not overseas
      That my real love is.
      Nice to see the moon from a new angle
      And in an old market square to wrangle
      For exotic fruit or a slave bangle,
      But I'd be happy in one place with you.
      PRINCESS:  Despite the charms of distant, hot places
      And the pleasure of seeing new faces,
      Or shouting "They're off" in French at the races,
      I only want to go one place with you.
      I uses to visit all the winter sports
      And tour the Mediterranean ports.
      But now I can take it or leave it:
      I'd gladly forsake the world, please believe it.

      This is the Mayor of.. Hello, are you there.
      Could I speak to the Minister, please.
      This is the Mayor of South Eiderdown.
      Good morning, sir, good morning, yes.
      I'll come to the point.
      The people of this city need
      Relief from tax. the tax is high.
      The people of this city plead...
      I see. Thank you sir. Good bye.

      CROWD: Well, what did he say?
      What did the minister say.

      MAYOR: He said it is out of his hands.
      He said he is in the same boat.
      He said he would help if he could
      And suggests you go to the King.
      He suggests an audience with the King.

      CROWD: WIth the King. An audience with the King.

      AGITATOR: Yes, the King. You must arrange it.
      Ring up the palace. Ring up the palace.

      (Reluctantly the Mayor starts to dial. The camera pans
      to another part of the market place where the Travel
      Agent is with the princess.)

      IN ONE PLACE

      TRAVEL AGENT: Though I may be expert
      On travel abroad
      And know all the Import-
      ant places you've heard
      About at school and in the movies
      It is at home and not overseas
      That my real love is.

      Nice to see the moon from a new angle
      And in an old market square to wrangle
      For exotic fruit of a slave bangle,
      But I'd be happy in one place with you.

      PRINCESS: Despite the charms of distant, hot places
      And the pleasure of seeing new faces.
      Or shouting 'They're off' in French at the races,
      I only want to go one place with you.

      I used to visit all the winter sports
      And tour the Mediterranian ports.
      But now I can take it or leave it:
      I'd gladly forsake the world, please believe it.
