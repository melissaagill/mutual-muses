      Dearest Lawrence,
      Clifford tells me that the snow in
      London was thicker than it was here.
      I hope you have kept snow.  After your
      hectic weeks a couple of days at
      home will do you good.
      Yesterday evening taking my tiny
      Tennyson I read "the Princess" which en
      thralled me.  It is just the kind of
      thing I enjoy when I am not quite
      happy.  I miss my Lion and it reminds
      me of him.  This little book was a fav
      ourite of mine when I was a girl.
      and I am now reading several poems
      from it--May Queen, The Talking Oak
      and A Dream of Fare Women.  I shall
      show you.
      I have no news of course, but that
      I do love you, my dear one and long
      to see you again.
      I shall now go and do some
      thing towards my painting.  Start
      the jug in profile.

      Pett 30.3.52

      Dearest Lawrence,
      Clifford tells me that the snow in London was thicker than it was here - I hope you have kept snug. After your hectic weeks a couple of days at home will do you good.
      Yesterday evening - taking my tiny Tennyson I read "the Princess" which enthralled me - it is just the kind of thing I enjoy when I am not quite happy. I miss my Lion and it reminds me of him. This little book was a favourite of mine when I was a girl - and I am now reading several poems from it - May Queen, The Talking Oak and A Dream of Fair Women. I shall show you.
      I have no news of course - but that I do love you - my dear one and long to see you again.
      I shall now go and do something towards my painting - start the jug in profile.
