      Slow-motion of a second in a dream.
      We can even blow bottles for the coming wine.

      If someone's late excess, a mask, a drug,
      Wrung laurels from the earth, juice from the air,
      Poured neon into letters of his name
      Like sap along an alphabet of orchards,
      It is his field, the field of Mars and him.

      Mars for he won it from the noble blank.
      Venus is crouched in our symbolic selves,
      The happy voyeur, the amiable ear.

      I don't know how soon Miss Mercer's leaving but I think it is soon. Some woman, a young one I think Mrs Harrison called her, is due soonish. (Can Trumpet help with Miss mercer's luggage, she asks?)

      Here are two views of Dandy, trying to dress to suit the weather:

      Darling I must close now. If I am to please mother I must shave before I leave!

      I love and adore you. Think of me as I do of you.
      I love you
