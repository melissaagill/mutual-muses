      Lion feels more cheerful today than when he wrote yesterday. I hope he was not too dreary then but yesterday even his mane did not go right & you know how lions hate that!

      Father is boir have though he is still fairly weak but I gather that is to be expected. So I take it I shall have no inheritance of William IV silver tea-pots just yet.

      (A member of the public, dirtyish, in a black work overall has just attached what can only be described as 10s in his football forms. He has a Celenizion aireal coming and of his read, also.)

      Madeleine is raster at the ISA At Home evening on 10th November. Perhaps you would care to accompany your lion? I hope you will for me should had enjoy it.

      I will meet you whenever you suggest on Sunday or Monday.

      I love and adore you
      Lawrence
