      1-4-52 Pett Dearest Lawrence
      First my messages. Clifford is
      looking forward to seeing you on Monday
      next April 7th at Comsay Hall. If
      you wait for him in the lobby he
      will give you a ticket. Haire is
      having a "coffee party" afterwards,
      as he did once when we went.
      N.H. asked Clifford if any of Grace's
      friends would be at the lecture
      that she would like to come - and
      Clifford has said that you would!
      I thought you might enjoy it! Lovely
      grub! as you will be lecturing
      soon yourself you might have some
      things to discuss. Now mind you
      tell me all about it! and
      what Grace and Hetty wore!

      asked Clifford if any of Grace's<br/>friends would be at the lecture<br/>that
      she would like to come - and<br/>Clifford has said that you would!<br/>I thought
      you might enjoy it! Lovely<br/>Grub! As you will be lecturing<br/>soon yourself
      you might have some<br/>things to discuss. Now mind you<br/>tell me all about
      it! And<br/>what Grace and Wetty wore!
