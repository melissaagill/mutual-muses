      Thursday
      Dearest Sylvia
      Trevor Darrett's brother George is going to survey 46 on Monday morning at 9.30. I shall type out the list of our queries for him. I had a long talk with Peter Morrow last night & from my description he said he thought the house sounded a good buy, and cheap for what we are getting. Trevor D. says that his brother is very experienced in this work and I am sure we can rely on hm; the Pasmore introduction counts for a good deal. Well we will soon know; I am very confident and hopeful of a favourable report myself. I cannot wait to have my expectations confirmed. I will wire you when I know myself.
      I am glad that you are having such a social time. You know the opinion of a lion on that kind of thing. My only social engagement is next Sunday when I am dining with Hugh and Robin (mother's Americans) Jacobsen. After a week crazy with work I am looking forward to this very much.
      12.00 NG; 3.00 TG; are my lectures today. Then the 2nd ICA lecture this evening. Wish you were going to be there this time. Perhaps for the next one. I hope so.
      I feel better now; am, in fact, recovered (well, finally).
      I love love love you, dearest heart.
      I adore you
      Lawrence

      Dearest Sylvia

      Trevor [unclear]Darnett's[/unclear] brother George is going to survey 46 on Monday morning at 9.30. I shall type out the list of our queries for him. I had a long talk with Peter [unclear]Morrow[/unclear] last night & from my description he said he thought the house sounded a good buy and cheap for what we were getting. Trevor D says that his brother is very experienced in this work and I am sure we can rely on him & the Pasmore introduction counts for a good deal. Well, we will soon know: I am very confident and hopeful of a favourable report myself. I cannot wait to have my expectations confirmed I will write you when I know myself.

      I am glad that you are having such a social time. You know the opinion of lion on that kind of thing. My only social engagement is next Sunday when I am dining with Hugh & Rahim (mother's Americans) Jacobson. After a week crazy with work I am looking forward to this very much.

      12.00 NG & 3.00 TG: are my lectures today. Then the 2nd ICA lecture this evening. Wish you were going to be there this time. Perhaps for the next one. I hope so.

      I feel better now: am, in fact recovered (well, finally).

      I love love love you, dearest heart.
      I adore you
      Lawrence
