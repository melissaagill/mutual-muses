      17 June Blackheath Dearest Sylvia:

      Thank you so much for your letter which has just come.
      Forgive me for not writing before but yesterday was
      terribly busy.

      I miss you, too. I am not sleeping so well and I miss
      you whatever I am doing. I love you very much and you
      are always in my thoughts.

      I will 'note the contents' of your letter, as you ask.
      I will go through it now, point to point.

      I am sorry about not coming to Pett, but I understand and
      do not make it awkward for yourself. I beg you. I have
      made a note about the dates of the holiday, Thursday 30th
      July to 4th or 5th August. That is a delightful idea.
      Thank you for thinking of it.

      Do congratulate Clifford about the 3 articles: and G.
      wants 'a steady flow'. That is wonderful.

      I am sorry you feel bad but I hope that your social cal-
      endar (which seems very full) will distract you. You
      are in demand.

      Yes I will keep my eyes open and my ears to the ground
      about the Levy's flat, you may be sure.

      My Sutherland lecture went well (lots of people) and I have
      arranged an extra one, making three in all on the exhibition.

      Today I am going to the V and A (Moore slides for Peters-
      field), then lunch with Charles, a press show of Beware,
      my Lovely in the afternoon, and dinner at Wimbledon.

      Pasmore came last night, was very nice about the Art News
      article, and said: 'Lawrence, I like the bit on me very
      much' and borrowed a copy to show Wendy. I plan to do
      articles on (i) his abstract paintings and (ii) his constre-
      tions. He liked the idea of a Cambridge show very much
      (I'll tell M.).

      I must go to S. Kensington. But before I close this letter
      let me say again that I miss you and that I adore you.

      Take care of yourself, my painter, my love,
      I love you
      Lawrence

      Blackheath
      17 June
      Dearest Sylvia:

      Thank you so much for your letter which has just come. Forgive me for not writing before but yesterday was terribly busy.

      I miss you, too. I am not sleeping so well and I miss you whatever I am doing I love you very much and you are always in my thoughts.

      I will 'note the contents' of your letter, as you ask. I will go through it now, point by point.

      I am sorry about not coming to Pett but I understand and do not make it awkward for yourself, I beg you. I have made a note about the dates of the holiday, Thursday 30th July to 4th or 5th August. That is a delightful idea. Thank you for thinking of it.

      Do congratulate Clifford about the 3 articles: and G. wants 'a steady flow'. That is wonderful.

      I am sorry you feel bad but I hope that your social calendar (which seems very full) will distract you. You are in demand.

      Yes I will keep my eyes open and my ears to the ground about the Levy's flat, you may be sure.

      My Sutherland lecture went well (lots of people) and I have arranged an extra one, making three in all on the exhibition.

      Today I am going to the V and A (Moore slides for Petersfield), then lunch with Charles, a press show of Beware, my lovely in the afternoon, and dinner at Wimbledon.

      Pasmore came last night, was very nice about the Art News article, and said: 'lawrence, I like the bit on me very much' and borrowed a copy to show Wendy. I plan to do articles on (i) his abstract paintings and (ii) his constrctions. He liked the idea of a Cambridge show very much (I'll tell M.).

      I must go to S. Kensington. But before I close this letter let me say again that I miss you and that I adore you.

      Take care of yourself, my painter, my love.

      I love you

      Lawrence

      Blackheath

      17 June

      Dearest Sylvia:

      Thank you so much for your letter which has just come.
      Forgive me for not writing before but yesterday was
      terribly busy.

      I miss you, too. I am not sleeping so well and I miss
      you whatever I am doing. I love you very much and you
      are always in my thoughts.

      I will 'note the contents' of your letter, as you ask.
      I will go through it now, point by point.

      I am sorry about not coming to Pett but I understand and
      do not make it awkward for yourself, I beg you. I have
      made a note about the dates of the holiday, Thursday 30th
      July or 4th of 5th August. That is a delightful idea.
      Thank you for thinking of it.

      Do congratulate Clifford about the 3 articles: and G.
      wants 'a steady flow'. That is wonderful.

      I am sorry you feel bad but I hope that your social cal-
      endar (which seems very full) will distract you. You
      are in demand.

      Yes I will keep my eyes open and my ears to the ground
      about the Levy's flat, you may be sure.

      My Sutherland lecture went well (lots of people) and I have
      arranged an extra one, making three in all on the exhibition.

      Today I am going to the V and A (Moore slides for Peters-
      field), then lunch with Charles, a press show of Beware,
      my Lovely in the afternoon, and dinner at Wimbledon.

      Passmore came last night, was very nice about the Art News
      article, and said: 'Lawrence, I like the bit on me very
      much' and borrowed a copy to show Wendy. I plan to do
      articles on (i) his abstract paintings and (ii) his construc-
      tions. He liked the idea of Cambridge show very much
      (I'll tell M.).

      i must go to S. Kenginston. But before I close this letter
      let me say again that I miss you and that I adore you.

      Take care of yourself, my painter, my love,

      I love you
      Lawrence
