      THE MASQUE OF WATER    FOUR

      The liquid synthesis,
      The flood, on which we move or which
      We linger by on tilted banks,
      Rhetorical or langorous,
      Flashes by day and sighs at night,
      As we follow the capital stream
      By wharf and balustrade,
      By scarp and flat and delta,
      To the sea-shore and the foreign craft.

      A Dolphin Speaks:

      On the sea-shore at low-tide
      When the remote sea is heavy as custard
      and it seems the wave will never
      Be furious and agile
      Listen to the rumcuring shells.

      Listen.  Mermaids rise to pick
      White roses every wave renews.
      The shells confide to shells in hair,
      Of powerful disappearing swimmers
      Who are islands when we wake.

      Of caves in the chest of pirates,
      Of girls who were ships and now
      Of the unchanged beared anchors.
      Pearls tremble in your listening ear,
      Echo the metaphor and voyage.

      The Crew Chant:

      From the bubbling lathering source, high in the heath,
      Where ferns fold over the aprted banks, like lapels,
      We came, launched by a sigh, down the curving flood,
      To the Thames at Greenwich where we paused for provisions
      Under the perilous bridges and dizzy cranes,
      Till we reached, after eight days and seven May nights,
      The hundreds of lions in the thighs of the sea,
      Our hold alive with images and more in the masts like monkeys.
      We land on the Level beach and roll ashore our barrels.

      Lion, dressed as a Captain, telescope under one arm, com-
      pass in his other hand.  An apple is struck on one point of
      the compass; from the other point flutters a map of his
      voyage upon which the river is coloured red.

      The journey through I honour
      The subject of my voyage,
      Each gift a metaphor,
      And every name a thing.

      THE MASQUE OF WATER FOUR
      The liquid synthesis,
      The flood, on which we move or which
      We linger by on titled banks,
      Rhetorical or languorous,
      Flashes by day and sighs at night,
      As we follow the capital stream
      By wharf and balustrade,
      By scarp and flat and delta,
      To the seashore and the foreign craft.

      A Dolphin Speaks:

      On the seashore at low tide
      When the remote sea is heavy as custard
      And it seems the wave will never
      Be furious and agile
      Listen to the rumoring shells.
      Listen. Mermaids rise to pick
      White roses every wave renews.
      The shells confide to shells in hair,
      Of powerful disappearing swimmers
      Who are islands when we wake.

      Of caves in the chests of pirates,
      Of girls who were ships and now
      Of the unchanged bearded anchors.
      Pearls tremble in your listening ear,
      Echo the metaphor and voyage.

      The Crew Chant:

      From the bubbling lathering source, high in the heath,
      Where ferns fold over the parted banks, like lapels,
      We came, launched by a sigh, down the curving flood,
      To the Thames at Greenwich where we paused for provisions,
      Under the perilous bridges and dizzy cranes,
      Till we reached, after eight days and seven May nights,
      The hundreds of lions in the thighs of the sea.
      Our hold alive with images and more in the masts like monkeys.
      We land on the Level beach and roll ashore our barrels.

      Lion, dressed as a Captain, telescope under one arm, compass in his other hand. An apple is stuck on one point of the compass; from the other point flutters a map of his voyage upon which the river is colored red.

      The journey through I honor
      The subject of my voyage,
      Each gift a metaphor,
      And every name a thing.
