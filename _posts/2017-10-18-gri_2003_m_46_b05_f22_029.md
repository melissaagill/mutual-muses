      3 is so pleased with herself as she only works once a week!

      I am delighted to hear the the May Athene is [unclear]alright[/unclear] - poor lady I fear she's her Summer Helmet on!
      You will be pleased to hear that Mr Clark has paid the 21 guineas I had a cheque this morning.
      I shall be interested to know about Beryl of Bainstead's interior!!
      I have re-framed - I think perfectly - the decorative still-life I think it looks wonderful - I can't think why I haven't done it before. I have been working in the Attic - I have finished the trees and started
