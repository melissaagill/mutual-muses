      1) These darkening meadows & these closing flowers Reminds me as I walk of Sussex fields where I have walked, to which my heart returns. This common, dusty and inadequate, reminds me of its better, The spaces and the colors of that land I walked with love, and ending on the sea, The sea that pulses like a heart. The sun's last epaulet has fallen And country matters mean too much for me. My memories are tense as silhouettes (Venetian darling on the dazzled sheets). You sit in a compartment, between the town, between the sea; the sea I would forsake but for the unwritten pages.
      _____
      2) Beside my bed all night 2 roses burning invoked an empire in my sleeping head. Pink towers, out of Carpacero, were laid Against a cobalt sky. And animals were wreathed in floors and portals in my dream. This city had a symbol's power: It is the image of a journey taken It is a hidden world the future owns. The morning wakes me but does not efface the precious dream of the concluded night. O, could I wake from waking, find the city As real as lonely as these waking roses which were my dream and are reality
      ________
      3) The images of roses that I use Are common to the plots of centuries And yet they flourish in the summer light And yet they summon up your bone and flesh. The sea criss//-crossed by flashing sails and white pomposted surf is old as Venus' birth Yet is a symbol which transcends Associations of a place or time. As lovers who have loved a day and night And then a further day we gave to time who regulates our lives when we're apart A fine defeat we can renew at will.
      Upon our bed embracing like the rose We vanquished time by pure forgetfulness.

      Reminds me as I walk of Sussex fields
      where I have walked, to which my heart returns.

      Reminds me of its better,
      The spaces and the colors of that land
      I walked with love, and ending on the sea,

      invoked an empire in my sleeping head:
      Pink towers, out of Carpaccio, were laid

      1) These darkening meadows & these closing flowers
      Reminds me as I  walk of Sussex fields
      where I have walked, to which my heart returns.
      This common, dusty and inadequate,
      Reminds me of its letter,
      The spaces and the colors of that land
      I walked with love, and ending in the sea,
      The sea that pulses like a heart.
      The sun's last epaulet has fallen
      And country matters mean too much for me.
      My memories are [unclear]tense[/unclear] as silhouettes
      (Venetian darling on the dazzled sheets).
      You sit in a compartment,
      Between the town, between the sea; the sea
      I would forsake but for unwritten pages.

      2) Beside my bed all night 2 roses burning
      I marked an empire in my sleeping head:
      Pink towers, out of Carpaccio, were laid
      Against a cobalt sky. And animals
      Were wreathed in floors and portals in my dream.
      This city had a symbol's power:
      IC is the image of a journey taken
      IC is a hidden world the future owns.
      The morning wakes me but does not efface
      The precious dream of the [unclear]concluded[/unclear] night.
      O, could I wake from waking, find the city
      As real as lovely as there waking roses
      Which were my dream and are reality

      3) The images of roses that I use
      Are common to the plots of centuries
      And yet they flourish in the summer night
      And yet they summon up your love and flesh.
      The sea criss-crosses by flashing sails and white
      Impasted surf is old as Venus' birth
      Yet is a symbol which transends
      Associations of a place a time.
      As lovers who have loved a day and night
      And then a further day we gave to time
      who regulates our lives when we're apart
      A fine defeat we can renew at will.


      Uranus led embracing like the rose
      We vanquished time by pure forgetfulness.
