      The Kensington Art Gallery

      The autumn salon at the Kensington Art Gallery is well worth visiting. The standard of accomplishment is high combining anticipated excellence and pleasant surprises. The Gallery has a way of mingling familiar and new names, unified by the constant of painterly virtue.

      Of considerable interest among the celebrated names are two oils by Mark Gertler, one a School of Paris exercise, the other a [unclear]inspiring[/unclear] still life. There is a good recent portrait by Matthew Smith, a hit after many recent misses, and - something of a rarity - a Lowry oil sketch for a large picture. There are also two late works of Lucian Pissarro.

      Still life is a great 20th century theme in English as in French studios. There is Meninski's post-impressionism fruit, void of association, its raison d'etre purely formal; at the opposite extreme is The Library Table by Isobel Nevill in which the objects exist not in painterly terms at all but purely as symbols of the bourgeois good life (flowers and a penguin book). Gertler's large piece is in the Grand Manner - plaster cast, musical instrument, garland, grapes - classical associations organised in addition to the form. An enchanting example of objects in themselves commonplace given great distinction by colour and design is Sylvia Sleigh's Brassica Seedlings.

      Landscapes range from England seen through the eyes of a weekend on Shell (John Nash) to a South of France maize field as seen by fauve-revivalist (Anthony Gross). Between these
