      opportunity to study the German School.  I am amused to find that Valsari "Slangs" Pontoumo for being over-influenced by Durer in his later work.  However the present exhibition sounds enchanting.  I hope you can show me pictures of it when you return.

           I'm glad your stay with Peter is being pleasant.  I hope he so continues - it is economical and much nicer to be with a friend.

           To-day M. and I went in to Hastings to get a frame for Mrs. Hake's picture.  Michael found a nice narrow gold one -- of a nice silvery gilt which suits the picture extremely well and will please Mrs. Hake for it will match her other frames nicely.

           Our visit to Hastings went off nicely though I was very loath to go on Saturday - as the weather was perfect for painting.  The pageant was a great success and looked quite beautiful - using the gentle but fairly steep slopes of Lodge Hill was very effective - with trees

      3 opportunity to study the German School. I am amused to find that Varsari "slangs" Pontormo for being over-influenced by Durer in his later work. However the present exhibition sounds enchanting. I hope you can show me pictures of it when you return.
      I'm glad your stay with Peter is proving pleasant - I hope he so continues - it is economical and much nicer to be with a friend.
      Today M and I went in to Hastings to get a frame for Mrs Hake's picture. Michael found a nice narrow gold one - of a nice silvery gilt which suits the picture extremely well and will please Mrs Hake for it will match her other frames nicely.
      Our visit to Ditchling went off nicely though I was very loath to go on Saturday - as the weather was perfect for painting. The pageant was a great  success, and looked quite beautiful - using the gentle  but fairly steep slopes of Lodge Hill was very effective - with trees
