    clean_transcription: ' Monday morning : 8 XII<br/> The sun is bright this morning
      one can see the bushes in the front garden between the road and the lawn - so
      the fog is clearing. However, Mrs Harrison tells me the fog is predicted to
      return so I shall not go to the V and A as perhaps I really should. Instead
      I shall go tomorrow morning before catching the 12.44 to Chipstead. Then, when
      I get back from Chipstead, I have to go to the ICA to review the Max Ernst exhibit.
      So I shall not mind a quiet day at home today. I don''t suppose I shall have
      a chance to write tomorrow. What I shall do today (before the fog returns) is
      to go to Charlton library: otherwise my books will be overdue and I am trying
      - like a good Lion, not to let that happen.<br/> Perhaps it isn''t even foggy
      on the coast. In any case I hope you have sufficient light to get some painting
      done - you wouldn''t have had, here, I''m afraid.<br/>I love you , dearest love
      you<br/>Lawrence<br/>PROJECTED LION XMAS CARDS:<br/>XXX L'
