      9th November 1948

      Dearest Sylvia,

         Many thanks for your letters which are very
      sweet to me.

         I am so happy about your paintings - you
      seem to be producing them as I do poems. It
      is fine news.  I look forward very much to
      seeing Rye and the Oak Tree.

         I shall come Friday morning on the 8:45
      from Victoria which reaches Hastings at
      10:40.  Please meet me - dearest - for I
      don't suppose we will be permitted many
      opportunities to talk.  Come on the bus
      that arrives a little later than the train.
      Tell me if I should come to the front to
      meet your bus or wait at the station.
      I long for the chance to talk to you.

         Darling, of course, I shall be kind
      when I come out do not interpret this to
      mean we must not be precise about future
      arrangements.  We must talk about our
      plans - they are still rogue.  Oh I love you
      so much.

      P.S. By the time we get to Italy great new galleries in the Assisi for the Venetian pictures and the self-portraits will be open.    L.

      Dearest Sylvia,
      Many thanks for your letters which are very sweet to me.
      I am so happy about your paintings - you seem to be producing them as I do poems. It is fine news. I look forward very much to seeing Rye and the Oak Tree.
      I shall come Friday morning on the 8:45 from Victoria which reaches Hastings at 10:40. Please meet me - dearest- for I don't suppose we will be permitted many opportunities to talk. Come on the bus that arrives a little later than the train. Tell me if I should come to the front to meet your bus or wait at the station. I long for this chance to talk to you.

      Darling, of course, I shall be [unclear]kind[/unclear] when i come out do not interpret this to mean we must not be precise about [unclear]future[/unclear] arrangements. We must talk about our plans - they are still vague. Oh I love you so much.

      PS By the time we get in Italy great new [unclear]gallons[/unclear] in the Uffizi for the Venetian [unclear]pictures[/unclear] and the [unclear] sell-rantiats[/unclear] will be open.
      L.
