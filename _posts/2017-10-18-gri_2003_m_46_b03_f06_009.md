      I have heard from Chameleon and it is unlikely that it will ever appear, unfortunately.  I am going to write, checking on the prospects of publication.  If these are very remote I shall keep the Gilpin article and charge Mollie Herbert for the photographs and a few expenses, such as two fares to the V and A.  This is rather disappointing but compensating for this I have worked out a few details for my second book.  The artists would include Francis Hayman, George Lambert, and Henry Walton (tomorrow I shall see his work); then I could expand my Glipin article (I shall have 6 photographs already), and close, possibly, with 'Mannerism and Regency Architecture.'  I shall include two or three other articles, perhaps one on Wilson, Benjamin, I mean.  Do tell me your opinion of this projected scheme.  If you tell Michael would you ask him not to mention it to Ian Philips who might mention the subjects to a possible rival.  I know it is unlikely but there is a slight, but real, possibility of being thus anticipated - especially about the Regency one.

      I will send you the Millyard Book & The Eagle tomorrow.  How many more books must M. read?

      This afternoon I want, if possible, to work on D.O.A., and get the article into shape before going to France, in case anybody there is interested in such articles, as Peter [unclear]Simovous[/unclear] thought was likely.

      My darling Sylvia, I love you so dearly.  Your elegant image rises from memory born up by a great number of white owls which show up by their feathers the warm colours of your body.  I am so glad you are working well.  I adore you, extravagantly and constantly.  Continue to paint and you will ensure my contentment, which is tried at our long parting.  By painting the time will pass quickly - with the unexpected speed of an owl hunting in the evening.  I love you
