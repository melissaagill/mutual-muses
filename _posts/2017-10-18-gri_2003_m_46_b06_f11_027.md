      by means of opaque colored surfaces only. Here Klee is static
      whereas his line and plane are dynamic. His signs for movement
      and signs in movement are not supported by color in his theory.
      On the other hand, composition, another component of the Design
      section of the Bauhaus curriculum, is brilliantly, though indir-
      ectly, covered, because to Klee the work of art is an image of movement. Therefore space is 'a temporal conception'. The
      classes of active-medial-passive are all time-functions.
      Klee wrote: 'When I came to be a teacher I had to account ex-
      plicitly for what I had been used to doing unconsciously' (7).
      Actually, Klee was theoretically oriented before Gropius invit-
      ed him to join the Bauhaus in January, 1921. His main theo-
      retical period is ca.1918-25. As I say, the Sketchbook de-
      fines beautifully a dynamic world-view and offers advice on all
      but one of the methods with which to express space as time.
      However, Klee has omitted another quality from the Sketchbook
      which is as essential to his art as color: phantasy has been
      excluded from these elementary exercises. Magic in art is a
      quality that, if you have it, you can't get rid of and lacking
      it, you can't pick it up. The element of phantasy and the mys-
      terious arrival of images, discussed in another book by Klee
      in 1925, is excluded as personal. This voluntary suppression
      by the artist of a part of his personality helps, I think, to
      keep this book significant today. The Lady Demon, the Park near

      by means of opaque colored surfaces only. Here Klee is static whereas his line and plane are dynamic. His signs for movement and signs in movement are not supported by color in his theory. On the other hand, composition, another component of the Design section of the Bauhaus curriculum, is brilliantly, though indirectly, covered, because to Klee the work of art is an image of movement. Therefore space is "a temporal conception". The classes of active-medial-passive are all time-functions.

      Klee wrote: "When I came to be a teacher I had to account explicitly for what I had been used to doing unconsciously" (7). Actually. Klee was theoretically oriented before Gropius invited him to join the Bauhaus in January, 1921. His main theoretical period is ca.1918-25. As I saw, the sketchbook defines beautifully a dynamic world-view and offer advice on all but one of the methods with which to express space as time.

      However, Klee has omitted another quality from the Sketchbook which is an essential to his art as color: phantasy has been excluded from these elementary exercises. Magic in art is a quality that, if you have it, you can't get rid of and lacking it, you can't pick it up. The element of phantasy and the mysterious arrival of images, discussed in another book by Klee in 1925, is excluded as personal. This voluntary suppression of a part of his personality by the artist helps, I think, to keep this book significant today. The Lady Demon, the Park near Lu, the Stricken Town, the Magicians in Dispute are Klee's pro-
