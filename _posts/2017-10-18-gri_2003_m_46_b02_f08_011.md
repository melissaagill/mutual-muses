      Blackheath
      13 ix 1949
      Dearest Sylvia,

      I hope you are well my dearest creature and that
      you are painting. Tell me again what canvases you
      would like beside the one for the sequel to Venus.

      I have written two unrhymed sonnets about ourselves
      in this summer landscape: first LATE SUMMER:

      The Summer is a palinode
      To the Spring's uncertainties:
      The sudden storm that pricked flat
      Like a harsh unshaven chin
      The promising bed of flowers
      And dark regressive afternoons
      Of the silence of the postmen.

      This warm delaying epilogue
      Extends to Autumn Summer's bribe
      Of a sundae of bright fruit:
      The longer nights are cooler but
      The vivid climate lingers.
      Sunbathing among the crisp trophies
      We catch a brown leaf on the thigh.

      And, THE GARDEN:

      Summer bribed the fruit and evenings
      To be welcome to the lovers:
      The fallacies of war
      Are implicit in the ruin,
      Shattered green-house, aimless vane,
      But these trophies are defeated
      By the attributes of Ceres,
      Orchards rampant on the sky
      On a clement azure series.

      Exchanging emblematic fruit
      We mirror Summer in a glass.
