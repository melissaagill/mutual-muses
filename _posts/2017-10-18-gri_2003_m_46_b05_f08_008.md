      Blackheath
      6 August

      Dearest Sylvia
      I adore your sketch of The [unclear]Fang[/unclear]. It is wonderful. How I want to see
      it. To quote from the song in Singin' In the Rain: Nature must have
      fashioned it for you - it is completely a see-scene.

      It is marvelous news that you can visit me. You suggest
      coming on the 15th or 16th. [unclear]Little[/unclear] day suits me very well. I must
      warn you, I cannot be sure of having much money. So leaving
      that in mind you should arrange to go on to Bath from Blackheath
      when you think best. But do stay with me for as long as you can.
      I hope that is clear and quick about the dates, as you requested.

      I am glad George liked your painting; glad, too, that it
      was pleasant and says he will be helpful. Good!

      Thank you for your encouraging rewards about The Guard
      drawing. I will try and work it up soon. I have not time at the
      moment. I am busy getting tomorrow's lecture ready- on
      Realism & Surrealism. Word, by the way, was quite well-
      received: about 25 people.

      Had a very nice time at Passover. A pleasant supper:
      then Wendy disappeared at P., Hill, and I talked about ART.
      mainly about Picasso & Mondrian and the choice between
      concrete art and abstracting pictures from nature. Hill had
      some interesting opinions & recent news of art in Paris.
      He tells me, by the way, the [unclear]Picasso[/unclear] in the T.G. [unclear]etc.[/unclear], is in
      1912 - which is incredibly early. [unclear]Pasmore[/unclear] is coming to
      tea, here, on Sunday 10th.

      Darling, I must do some more work on Duchamp. He is terribly difficult to explain impartially to popular audience.

      I will write again very soon.

      Love you,
      Lawrence

      6 August Blackheath Dearest Sylvia
      I adore your sketch of the Forge. It is wonderful. How I want to see
      it. To quote from the song in Singin' In The Rain: Nature must have
      fashioned it for you - it is completly a see-scene.

      It is marvellous news that you can visit me. You suggest
      coming on the 15th or 16th. Either day suits me very well. I must
      warn you, I cannot be sure of having much money. So bearing
      that in mind, you should arrange to go on to Bath from Blackheath
      when you think best. But do stay with me for as long as you can.
      I hope that is clear and quick about the dates, as you requested.

      I am glad George liked your paintings; glad, too, that it
      was pleasant and says he will be helpful. Good!

      Thank you for your encouraging remarks about The Guard
      drawing. I will try and work it up soon. I have not time at the
      moment. I am busy getting tomorrow's lecture ready - on
      Dadaism & Surrealism. Ward, by the way, was quite well -
      received: about 25 people.

      Had a very nice time at Pasmores. A pleasant supper:
      then Wendy disappeared & P., Hill, and I talked about ART.
      Mainly about Picasso & Mondrian and the choice between
      concrete art and abstracting pictures from nature. Hill had
      some interesting opinions & recent news of art in Paris.
      He tell me, by the way, the Picahin in the T.G. ech., is in
      1912 - which is incredibly early. Pasmore is coming to
      tea, here, on Sunday 10th.

      Darling, I must do some more work on Duchamp. He is
      terribly difficult to explain impartially to a popular audience.
      I will write you again very soon
      I love you
      Lawrence
