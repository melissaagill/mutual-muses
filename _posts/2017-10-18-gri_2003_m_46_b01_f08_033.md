      How re-assuring it was to get your letter this morning in an unfamiliar landscape though I am sorry that your news is not all happy.

I will try and arrange [unclear] the kind of light[/unclear] you particularly want: I shall send the Tawney One down to you long enough to fix the weather. He shall be[unclear]my mercy[/unclear].
      The Beggar's Opera was enchanting. Do listen to one of the broadcasts this week: they are not all on the third, I believe. Poor Dandylion clean forgot about [unclear]Fortenums. of well perhaps[/unclear] in September 1949. I'll book if I can for Crime [unclear]Passioned[/unclear] on my return which will be next weekend. I would like to see it again.
      Sylvia, would you send me The Building of Bats. I do not have it (any white owl [unclear] could not get it[/unclear] - despite the duffel coat). Would you send it as promptly as possible for I have only a few days here. First post Friday is the absolute outside. Thank you darling so much.
