      LYRIC

      I will never relinquish the image
      Of girls yielding to the light
      Which eats their weight until they flow.

      We become what we have eaten.
      I swallow cherries. The orchard sways
      In the wind that is never hungry.

      Dressed by afternoon the girls
      Dissolve like fruit in the sun's mouth.
      Eaten by the sun they burn
      In the sky above the orchards.

      LYRIC

      White masks of surf surround the islands
      Like young girls visiting a ball:
      Fans of fern are silhouetted
      On the undulating traces.

      Like columns of a fallen town
      That breaks on the barbarous coast
      The waves fall in corinthian fragments.

      O classical nostalgic shore.

      When I romantically elude
      Hierarchies of rock inland
      The animistic sea consigns
      Such disturbing and erotic shells. . .

      LYRIC
      I will never relinquish the image
      Of girls yielding to the light
      Which eats their weight until they flow.

      We become what we have eaten.
      I swallow cherries.  The orchard aways
      In the wind that is never hungry.

      Dressed by afternoon the girls
      Dissolve like fruit in the sun's mouth.
      Eaten by the sun they burn
      In the sky above the orchards.

      LYRIC
      White masks of surf surround the islands
      Like young girls visiting a ball:
      Fans of ferns are silhouetted
      On the undulating traces.

      Like columns of a fallen town
      That breaks on the barbarous coast
      The waves fall in corinthian fragments.

      O classical nostalgic shore.

      When I romantically elude
      Hierarchies of rock island
      The animistic sea consigns
      Such disturbing and erotic shells...
