      I am anxious to do some more work on the Rose-garden - I have "done" some of
      the roses and dugs over over a little putting in some lupin seedlings. I had
      hoped to do some more this afternoon. I also want to do a more detailed sketch
      for my mural. <br/>I shall try to come as soon as I can - I will let you know.
      I think I have the dates wrong - and card goes back a bit earlier. '
