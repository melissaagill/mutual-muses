      Blackheath
      Monday

      Dearest Sylvia,

      I can't think what you are doing applying for the job at
      Durham. Have you thought what our position would be like if
      you got it? Can you be so irresponsible? When should we
      meet? Certainly you would be able to Keep Michael financial-
      ly but you would hardly retain my love if you sacrificed me
      to that end. I feel depressed and hurt that you consider
      such a course. You cannot place this importance on money
      before love, surely; if Michael would only get a job
      instead of farting about the problem would be less acute.
      What you have told me about love and proved in your actions
      shows up the real value of this wretched lecturing post.
      You suggest I apply: I won't for the reasons that I wish
      you hadn't. I hope it is only as the result of pressure
      from M that you take this step. You cannot want it to
      happen. Our meetings would be far between and haunted.

      I am sorry to write so but what you suggest seems to me
      to run counter to the reality of love, the reality-principle
      of love.

      Yesterday Charles took us all in a ride in his car: we
      went to Eltham, hoping to see the palace, but it is only
      open on Thursdays. It is on rather dilapidated crown
      lands. He took a wide route coming back, through Woolwich
      and other places like that which are vile in their stifl-
      ing urban appearance. Blackheath, I realise it increasingly,
      is happily situated, neither too far out nor in.

      Jaspers is an existentialist philosopher - hence the con-
      trast with Dandy which obtains even today when he is a bit
      saddened.

      I can't make out what Ruth has had but I'm glad she looks
      more healthy.

      I long to see you because I love you, you make me happy,
      and I will make you happy, too.

      What of your painting if you go to Durham?

      Dearest Sylvia, I love you dearly, but I also love you
      passionately: possibly that makes for occasional difficulties
      but I believe on the whole it is an advantage. I adore,
      adore, adore, you. Come soon
      Lawrence

      Blackheath
      Monday

      Dearest Sylvia,
      I can't think what you are doing applying for the job at
      Durham.  Have you thought what our position would be like if
      you go it?  Can you be so irresponsible?  When should we
      meet?  Certainly you would be able to Keep Michael Finanical-
      ly but you would hardly retain my love if you sacrifised me
      to that end.  I feel depressed and hurt that you consider
      such a course.  You cannot place this importance on money
      before love, surely.  if Michael would only get a job
      instead of farting about the problem would be less acute.
      What you have told me about love and proved in your actions
      shows up the real value of this wretched lecturing post.
      You suggest I apply:  I won't for the reasons that I wish
      you hadn't.  I hope it is only as the result of pressure
      from M that you take this step.  You cannot want it to
      happen.  Our meetings would be far between and haunted.

      I am sorry to write so but what you suggest seems to me
      to run counter to the reality of love, the reality-principle
      of love.

      Yesterday Charles took us all in a ride in his car:  we
      went to Eltham, hoping to see the palace, but it is only
      open on Thursday.  It is on rather dilapidated crown
      lands.  He took a wide route coming back, through Woolwich
      and other places like that which are vile in their stilf-
      ing urban appearance.  Blackheath, I realise it increasingly,
      is happily situated, neither too far out nor near in.

      Jaspers is an existentialist philosopher, hence the con-
      trast with Dandy which obtains even today when he is a bit
      saddened.

      I can't make out what Ruth has had but I'm glad she looks
      more heathy.

      I long to see you becuase I love you, you make me happy,
      and I will make you happy, too.

      What of your painting if you go to Durham?

      Dearest Sylvia, I love you dearly, but I also love you
      passionately:  possibly that makes for occasional difficulties
      but I believe on the whole it is an advantage.  I adore,
      adore, adore, you.  Come soon

      Blackheath
      Monday

      Dearest Sylvia,
      I can't think what you are doing applying for the job at Durham. Have you thought what our position would be like if you got it? Can you be so irresponsible? When should we meet? Certainly you would be able to keep Michael financially but you would hardly retain my love if you sacrificed me to that end. I feel depressed and hurt that you consider such a course. You cannot place this importance on money before love, surely; if Michael would only get a job instead of farting about the problem would be less acute. What you have told me about love and proved in your actions shows up the real value of this wretched lecturing post. You suggest I apply: I won't for the reasons that I wish you hadn't. I hope it is only as the result of pressure from M that you take this step. You cannot want it to happen. Our meetings would be far between and haunted.
      I am sorry to write so but what you suggest seems to me to run counter to the reality of love, the reality-principle of love.
      Yesterday Charles took us all in a ride in his car: we went to Eltham, hoping to see the palace, but it is only open on Thursdays. It is on rather dilapidated crown lands. He took a wide route coming back, through Woolwich and other places like that which are vile in their stifling urban appearance. Blackheath, I realize it increasingly, is happily situated, neither too far our nor near in.
      Jaspers is an existentialist philosopher - hence the contrast with Dandy which obtains even today when he is a bit saddened.
      I can't make out what Ruth has had but I'm glad she looks more healthy.
      I long to see you because I love you, you make me happy, and I will make you happy, too.
      What of your painting if you go to Durham?
      Dearest Sylvia, I love you dearly, but I also love you passionately: possibly that makes for occasional difficulties but I believe on the whole it is an advantage. I adore, adore, adore, you. Come soon.
