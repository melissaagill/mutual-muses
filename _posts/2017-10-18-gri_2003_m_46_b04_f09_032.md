      BLACKheath:  28 ix  1951

      Dearest Sylvia,

      Thank you so much for your wonderfully long letter.  Hetty, Lionel, Yawolla, and Dandy read a page each and then exchanged: there was a little confusion but luck-ily  Lionel was equal to the occasion and saw to it that the exchange was orderly. Without him we would never have been sure that each of us had read all the news.

      You ask about Banstead. Well (I have already told you how you were missed), I found, after a long search, most of the slides I wanted: Cellini's salt cellar, Sutton Place, Family of More, Flemish (Vertumnus and Pomona) and French (Danae) tapestries, early wallpaper, leather hangings, furniture, plasterwork, &c. I have established the intricate and complex side of N Europ-ean art in 16th century: next week I shall deal with Spain and Florence and liberal republic of Venice.

      Dandy is sitting with nothing on in the sun to write this. It is, however, cloudy in the distance: also, wasps keep chasing me into corners.

      Herbert Reiser suggested I write an article about Turnbull's sculpture and place it in a Swiss journal. Turnbull invited me to his studio so I may write something. We'll see.

      This evening I am going to the South Bank with Mary: I am meeting her at 5 and then I am going on, later, to Wimbledon for the night. Then Saturday afternoon I shall see McHale and, perhaps, see a fim. (I have not been for nearly 3 weeks:  it seems . . . shorter.) My war films art-icle that i read at Pett is growing longer: soldiers as 'things', by theme of the Quest. How interesting about the Cleggs, by the way. I shall put in a footnote (see below)*.

      I have a vivid picture of you at work on the Village Green. It sounds charming, busy and gratifying at the same time. You seem to be Tiny's proxy at the moment. I hope you are looking after your hands during all  this gardening. Are you now?


      * The author wishes to thank Miss Wassily for drawing his attention to this material.

      28 ix 1951 BLACKheath: Dearest Sylvia,

      Thank you so much for your wonderfully long letter.
      Hetty, Lionel, Yawolla, and Dandy read a page each and
      then exchanged: there was a little confusion but luck-
      ily Lionel was equal to the occasion and saw to it that
      the exchange was orderly. Without him we would never
      have been sure that each of us had read all the news.

      You ask about Banstead. Well (I have already told
      you how you were missed), I found, after a long search,
      most of the slides I wanted: Cellini's salt cellar,
      Sutton Place, Family of More, Flemish (Vertumnus and Pom-
      ona) and French (Danae) tapestrides, early wallpaper,
      leather hangings, furniture, plasterwork, &c. I have
      established  the intricate and complex side of N Europ-
      ean art in 16th century: next week I shall deal with
      Spain and Florence and liberal republic  of Venice.

      Dandy is sitting with nothing on in the sun to write
      this. It is, however, cloudy in the distance: also,
      wasps keep chasing me into corners.

      Herbert Reiser suggested I write an article about
      Turnbull's sculpture to accompany his photographs and
      he will try and place it in a Swiss jounal. Turnbull
      invited me to his studio so I may write something. We'll
      see.

      This evening I am going to the South Bank with Mary:
      I am meeting her at 5 and then I am going on, later, to
      Wimbledon for the night. Then Saturday afternoon I shall
      see McHale and, perhaps, see a film.  (I have not been for
      nearly 3 weeks: it seems...shorter.) My war films art-
      icle that I read at Pett is growing longer: soldiers as
      'things', the theme of the Quest. How interesting about
      the Cleggs, by the way. I shall put in a footnote (see
      below)*.

      I have a vivid picture of you at work on the Village
      Green. It sounds charming, busy and gratifying at the
      same time. You seem to be Tiny's proxy at the moment.
      I hope you are looking after your hands during all this
      gardening. Are you now?

      * The author wishes to thank Miss Wassily for drawing
      his attention to this material.
