      first time I've done that for ages, and wrote this sonnet for you:

      Where lawns slope to a lake
      Orlando holds a glass
      (Carved with the castle of desire)
      While Dorinda plaits her hair

      Rocks in a livery of moss
      Support a downpour
      That wakes the sleeping lake
      Where swans glide and rear

      Overlapped by grass
      Like a fringe of reeds
      And silver as a pool
      The glass lies on the lawn

      Reflecting a bird whose flight
      Rates castle walls at naught

      Dearest I love you and long for Thursday. Oh, my love.

      I love you
      Lawrence
