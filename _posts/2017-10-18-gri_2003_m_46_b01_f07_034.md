      VIII 1948<br/><br/>Dearest Sylvia,<br/><br/>I know it is wicked of me to write
      twice in one day when I have work  to do and you have Michael to think of. Still
      I feel I must write a few lines. <br/><br/>Thank you for sending me Clifford''s
      translation from Tuchs. I have written a note to him which I shall post this
      evening-later than this letter-because I have to get some stamps. <br/><br/>This
      quotation may amuse you. It''s from a old handbook for painters - by LOMAZZO:
      <br/><br/>''Wanton embracings are also of diverse forms, and must always be
      expressed with this regard, that the hands as the instruments thereof, do touch
      the most tender parts of the body'' (16th translation  which Hogarts read.)<br/>____________________________________________________
      Today I have written about 2000 words. I believe I must have thought of you
      at last 2000 times. Perhaps I should say you are never out of my mind. O, what
      pleasure reading your twin letters. You have, in the past, apologized for yourself
      as being a poor letter writer. This is quite wrong (here at least I venture
      to contradict Minerva, though rarely else) for I catch in your words exquisite
      modulations of mood and thought so that I share the thoughts behind your words.
      If this is not the secret of letter writings what can it be!<br/><br/>Another
      thing your letters do is encourage my love by revealing yours to me. And yet
      my love is implicit in the words you write originally. I hope my letters do
      the same, for two lovers who are separated silence is the worse torment, I am
      sure. It is impossible to define the reciprocal abilities of love yet how strongly
      we feel them and how piercing the experience of recognition. <br/><br/>I love
      you,<br/><br/>Lawrence '
