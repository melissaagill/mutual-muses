      BLACKHEATH
      24 X 1952

      Dearest Sylvia,

      I am wild about your sketch of your
      new painting.  It is a lovely comp-
      osition with ravishing perspective,
      sucking one into the picture but this
      movement is delayed by linear design
      and, I am sure, color.  And what a good
      shape!

      Yes, we must talk it over, but I do
      think some publicity in the local paper
      would be an excellent thing.  With a
      little discretion and ambiguity we can
      get over it.  Here the illiteracy of
      20c journalism will work for us.  And
      it might do you some good, I think.

      Poor cat, I hope Nora is not too
      fucking spiritual today.  Perhaps she
      will be earthbound for your tea date...
      Any hope of that?

      I enclose the Ramsgate cheque and
      thank you very much for advancing it
      to lion.  (Lion, by the way, has just
      paid two months' rent!)  Good lion.

      I have been typing out my Lincoln
      notes. Soon I must go to town to
      lecture to some Roman Girls about Ital-
      ian Art, at the NG.  Then tea with CJ.

      Already this morning I have been
      out shopping and time is 'whizzing' to
      quote Yawolla 'b'.  S I cannot write at
      length today.  But I must say how much
      I long to see you and love you.
      Lawrence.

      sucking one into the picture but this
      movement is delayed by linear design

      Yes, we must talk it over, but I do
      think some publicity in the local paper
      would be an excellent thing. With a

      it might do you some good, I think.

      Poor cat, I hope Nora is not too

      will be earthbound for your tea date...
      Any hope of that?

      I enclose the Ramsgate cheque and
      thank you very much for advancing it
      to lion. (Lion, by the way, has just
      paid two months' rent!) Good lion.

      I have been typing out my Lincoln
      notes. Soon I must go to town to
      lecture to some Roman Girls about Ital-
      ian Art, at the N. G. Then tea with CS.

      Already this morning I have been
      out shopping and time is 'whizzing' to
      quote Yawolla 'by' So I can not write at
      length today. But I must say how much
      I long to see you and love you,
      Lawrence
