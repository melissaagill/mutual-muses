      FOR MY MUSE

      'All the time of writing his Paradise lost, his
      veine began at the Autumnall AEquinoctiall and
      ceased at the Vernall or thereabouts' (Aubrey).

           Autumn is said to be a poet's time,
           When walking through the orchards poets
           Are stunned by falling fruit  :   imagination.
           Miltonic grandeur of colour
           Glazons the landscape of a Fall.

           Early while the morning's wet
           Is the time to write;  early
           Before the dinner-gong wounds the silence;
           Or in the early morning ringed
           By a solar system of candles.

           The country's best where there is a sense
           Of order in the metrical grass-hop:
           Though in the city moving figures
           Occupy the poet's anti-self
           Even as he launches the dazzling image.

           Naked but for a straw hat,
           Glareglasses on against the rhymes
           Strong in this part of the afternoon,
           The poet follows figures of ships tht curve
           Half on the water, half on air.

           Or Egyptian in one room
           Above the cracked and splintering river,
           Warmed by the contrast of fire and snow,
           He write a sestina in six hours,
           About the lion of summer in his cage.

           Now the painter can erect her easel
           Among the daffodils and transparent clouds
           And paint the flowered dresses and their girls,
           Agile or langorous, and poets
           Pursue the colour-adjectives.

      FOR MY MUSE
      'All the time of writing his Paradise lost, his
      veine began at the Autumnall Aequinoctiall and
      ceased at the Vernall or thereabouts' (Aubrey).

      Autumn is said to be a poet's time,
      When walking through the orchards poets
      Are stunned by falling fruit: imagination.
      Miltonic grandeur of colour
      Blazons the landscape of a Fall.

      Early while the morning's wet
      Is the time to write; early
      Before the dinner-gong wounds the silence;
      Or in the early morning ringed
      By a solar system of candles.

      The country's best where there is a sense
      Of order in the metrical grass-hop:
      Though in the city moving figures
      Occupy the poet's anti-self
      Even as he launches the dazzling image.

      Naked but for a straw hat,
      Glareglasses on against the rhymes
      Strong in this part of the afternoon,
      The poet follows figures of ships that curve
      Half on the water, half on air.

      Or Egyptian in one room
      Above the cracked and splintering river,
      Warmed by the contrast of fire and snow,
      He write a sestina in six hours,
      About the lion of summer in his cage.

      Now the painter can erect her easel
      Among the daffodils and transparent clouds
      And paint the flowered dresses and their girls,
      Agile or languorous, and poets
      Pursue the colour-adjectives.
