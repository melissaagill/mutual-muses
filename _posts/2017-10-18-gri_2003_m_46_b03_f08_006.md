      A) Theseues' black sail diminished to a pupil,
      Tiny and curious in the iris of the day.
      B) When I found her she was stunned like grain in a mill
      By the rotating stones the mill sails drive.
      A) My eylelids collapsed like caves on the bay.
      B) I heard her heart in the silence boast that she was alive.

      A) On this coast, long as a tragic monologue,
      I know that I must lose whom I adore,
      Choose lovers by the attributes of loss,
      Prophetic in their eyes or speech and long for death.
      B) Beyond surprise and sexual metaphor
      I post you then, past blood, past breath.

      B) the theatrical vista admits in great numbers
      personages not guided by the head:
      By the knots in their hair they are maenads,
      And their bodies are splashed with the blood of members

      Gamins) You who play Bacchus, faithful only to his profile,
      Suppress his leaps and grapes, build a fence
      Of academic ideals of permanence,
      We burn your straw, upend your idyll.

      A) They would divert my sorrow by ureason,
      Disrupt the casue of grief love and effect of grief,
      Chop logic like a swan's neck and laugh
      At its last song so early in the season.

      Gamins) Ignite the fuse and ride the explosion:
      Sensations of flight replace your stolid feet.
      They key of flesh can open gravity's gate
      And wings on your bottom guard against erosion.
