    clean_transcription: 3 2 major cuts - I don't know<br/>why the cinema audience
      is more<br/>adolescent that the theatre audience -<br/>but these are a pity
      - owe is<br/>the refereces which Blanche makes<br/>to Mitch in the story of
      her<br/>marriage to her husband's homosexuality,<br/>so that in the film the
      real reason<br/>for her double shock is not<br/>clear. The Second is in the
      end Stella<br/>is in the play comforted by her<br/>husband who starts making
      love to<br/>her, whereas in the film she goes<br/>upstairs with her child and
      says she<br/>is never coming back - which is quite<br/>out of character. But
      do read the<br/>play, I think you would like<br/>it very much - it is so full
      of<br/>symbolism - I haven't sorted it all<br/>out yet! It is a bit too near
      me!<br/>I am very grateful to the Savages for<br/>taking me!<br/>
