      Dearest Sylnia,
       Your dram ravishes me and has cast an exciting kind of /
      distortion in [unclear] the [/unclear] direction of enchantment one all my laughs /
      and actions.  [unclear] All morning [/unclear].  Dearest Sylnia, your magic accom- /
      panies your letter, as [unclear] wings [/unclear] accompany your hand on its /
      'flight', as [unclear] putti [/unclear] play in your shadow, as I adore you. /
         I am sorry to learn that you are still tired but I
      can understand how it happens after [unclear] the [/unclear] sustained effort /
      at the large painting.  Nonetheless, to adapt Michelangelo's /
      aphorism, no body will mind that you were tired, when con- /
      fronted with the painting itself.  For I am sure its colour - /
      istic lyricism and compound of repose and monument /
      will capture attention and delight.  But I mind at present - /
      as hope that household nonsense does not claim your /
      attention too much. /
      When are you coming? /
      S. John's school last night was amusing.  The boys  /
      were very keen and after a 10 minute delay when the lan- /
      tern caught fire (!) and I was near the end of the allotted /
      period, I wondered whether to stop or go on and the boys /
      roared: 'go on'.  The school is a near 1860 gather -  a quaint /
      and [unclear] interestingly [/unclear] kind of gather compared to the real thing at /
      King's, Ely.
                                   I love you,
                                       Lawrence
