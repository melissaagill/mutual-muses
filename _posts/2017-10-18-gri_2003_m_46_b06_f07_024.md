      Blackheath
      Tuesday

      My dearest Sylvia
      Thank you for such pleasing news - about my being ex-
      pected at Pett, after all. What a subtle cat you are,
      to have pulled this off. I will travel down on Fri-
      day, late in the afternoon. I will tell you in my
      next letter the time of the train. I can stay until
      Tuesday morning, when I have a lecture. That
      will give us 3 clear days, 4 full nights, as well
      as a bit each end.
      This means that I shall be able to see all your new
      paintings. I look forward to going to Rye, too,
      very much. (Tell me how the private view went.)
      I have the B'ham application forms: they came this
      morning.
      Magda sent her love & hopes to see you again soon.
      The Encyclopaedic Britannica have asked me to
      contribute to their year book. I am to cover painting & sculpture for 1953 and art exhibitions:
      3 articles in all.

      I must rush & get ready my Expressionism lecture.

      I adore you
      Lawrence

      Blackheath
      Tuesday
      My dearest Eylxia
      Thank you for such pleasing news - about my being ex-
      pected at Pett, after all. What a subtle cat you are,
      to have pulled this off. I will travel down on Fri-
      day, late  in the afternoon. I will tell you in my
      next letter the time of the train. I can stay until
      Tuesday morning, when I have a lecture. That
      will give us 3 clear days, 4 full nights, as well
      as a bit each end.
      This means that I shall be able to see all your new
      paintings. I look forward to going to Rye, too,
      very much. (Tell me how the private view went.)
      I have the B'ham application forms: they came this
      morning.
      Magda sent her love and hopes to see you again soon.
      The <ul> Encyclopedia Britannica <ul> have asked me to
      contribute to this year book. I am to cover
      painting & sculpture for 1953 and art exhibitions:
      3 articles in all.
      I must rush & get ready my Expressionism lecture.
      Adore you
      Laurence
