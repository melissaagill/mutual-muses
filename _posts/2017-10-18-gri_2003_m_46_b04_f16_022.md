      I am delighted to hear that
      Olson Rodwell is giving you a
      picture--splendid I shall look
      forward to seeing it.
      I have heard from the Kensington
      gallery--water colours have to
      be in on Tuesday May 18th
      so I will get Michael to call in
      for them on Monday when he passes.
      I think it may well be that
      I shall come on Sunday along.  Can
      you meet me if so?
