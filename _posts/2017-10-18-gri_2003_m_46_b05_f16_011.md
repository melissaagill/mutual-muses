      4    Mrs. Banger came up to me afterwards

      must ask Paul for hints. I think
      it really only mans prompting.  I'm
      very flattered of course!  but I
      would really rather be just audience.
      Yesterday I went to eversong and
      brought Mrs. Hake back for coffee and
      sandwiches before returning to
      hear Stainers Crnotition admirably
      done by the choir--but oh, I knew
      it was bad, but I had forgotten just
      how bad, how empty, how intermediate
      how thin, like watered piss,
      not a thought in it, a mandkis
      musical!
      I shall to bed now, my love, and
      I wish I were in your arms.  I adore
      you.  Dearest Lion love me
      I love you
