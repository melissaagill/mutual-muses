      Blackheath
      2nd February 1950
      Dearest Sylvia
          In your last letter I was charmed by your description /
      of being 'very busy'.  In the morning you had painted /
      Tiny - in the afternoon you 'sat'.  It conveys a feel- /
      ing of domestic and artistic calm to me - certainly in /
      contrast to my day yesterday.
           I got very wet several times.  After the W.I. lec- /
      ture which was successful despite some bad organizing /
      of the epidiascope so we could only see half a picture /
      at a time I went to Sutton.  First I tried the library: /
      it was cold.  So I went to the pictures and saw the /
      end of a western in which three people were shot:  I /
      know who did the killings but not why.  Then I saw /
      half of another film in which three people were stabbed, /
      and here I can guess the motive but do not know who. /
          The evening lecture was good, I believe:  neo-impres- /
      sionism, symbolism, and, finally, Cezanne.  Despite /
      the dreadful weather everybody was there - more than on /
      the first night. /
           I am delighted to hear of the jug - and long to see /
      it, and the cups.  I hope they will not complicate the /
      problem of packing unduly.  'Antiques' unfortunately /
      cannot get any more of that nice French material to cov- /
      er in the fireplace:  I wish I had better news of that /
      to answer your exciting acquisitions. /
          I have re-read Laforgue's psycho-analytical study of /
      Baudelaire (for Hogarth) and I am writing a poem about /
      Cythera, entitled Versions of Cythera, including B's /
      horrifying version of the island, though not of course confining myself to it.

      Note:  Words underscored for emphasis.

      Blackheath 2nd February 1950 Dearest Sylvia

      In your last letter I was charmed by your description
      of being 'very busy'.  In the morning you had painted
      Tiny, in the afternoon you 'sat'.  It conveys a feel-
      ing of domestic and artistic calm to me, certainly in
      contrast to my day yesterday.

      I got very wet several times.  After the W. I. lec-
      ture which was successful despite some bad organising
      of the epidiascope so we could only see half a picture
      at a time I went to Sutton.  First I tried the library;
      it was cold.  So I went to the pictures and saw the
      end of a western in which three people were shot: I
      know who did the killings but not why.  Then I saw
      half another film in which three people were stabbed,
      and here I can guess the motive but do not know who.

      The evening lecture was good, I believe: neo-impres-
      sionism, symbolism, and, finally, Cezanne.  Despite
      the dreadful weather everybody was there, more than on
      the first night.

      I am delighted to hear of the jug, and long to see
      it, and the cups.  I hope they will not complicate the
      problem of packing unduly.  'Antiques' unfortunately
      cannot get any more of that nice French material to cov-
      er in the fireplace: I wish I had better news of that
      to answer your exciting acquisitions.

      I have re-read Laforgue's psycho- analytical study of
      Baudelaire (for Hogarth) and I am writing a poem about
      Cythera, entitled Versions of Cythera, including B's
      horrifying version of the island, though not of course
      confining myself to it.
