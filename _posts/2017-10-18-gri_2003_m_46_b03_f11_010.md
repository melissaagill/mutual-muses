      before lunch, and I can meet your bus in the afternoon. Do, oh do come my dearest
      love, my rose. If I had not your pictures to delight me here, both aesthetically
      and for their loving content, I do not know how I could bear this void in which
      Time goes by for an unaccustomed time with-out bringing you here on his back,
      like Clio among the feathers of his wings. Come, bringing every owl, and Metty
      will comb Dandy's mane & Dandy hold the mirror for Metty and even Jawally, he
      has assured me, will be smartly dressed & with his hair combed back. For Jawalla
      is terribly subdued with you away. 'When is she coming?' he keeps asking Dandy
      & poor Dandy looks dejected as he turns out his trou-sers' pocket and answer,
      'soon'.  I have told Jawalla, in an effort to lighten his spirits, that you
      are coming on Saturday, and he has turned a rather hesitant cartwheel as he
      starts to recover. So come my love, come.\nI enclose two poems for you - ones
      which please me particularly and I hope will please you, too.\nIthell[unclear][/unclear]
      Calquahoun, whom I met last night, seems very nice. I will talk over with you
      her suggestions about a magazine. She is a strange person, very naive in many
