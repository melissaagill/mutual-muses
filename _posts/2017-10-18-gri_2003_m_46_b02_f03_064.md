      The Aubreys
      29 III 1949

      Dearest Sylvia

      Thank you for your letter which crossed my worried one in the post. This morning I shall finish [unclear]mahon[/unclear] and get down to Hogarth again - so that we can afford Italy. I feel more confident now for my muse has given me a motive for working again.

      I have a rather stuffy cold this morning which makes me breathe rather heavily but otherwise I'm alright.

      Last night's lecture was enjoyable and I think a success: over 30 people. I talked for 35-40 minutes and then we had about on hour's discussion.

      Poor Sylvia,  dearest [unclear]pussy[/unclear], how I feel for your indecision. I'm glad you are painting and reading, however, and to judge from your words, painting well and frequently. You are a lesson to Dandylion as he is first to admit. I hope you are sleeping well, my darling.

      Although it is Wednesday the post has brought nothing from Aberdeen House unfortunately.

      Oh, I must tell you. I [unclear]ware[/unclear] my bow all
