      [27-4-53]
      Wimbledon
      Monday
      Dearest Sylvia:
      I do hope that you are enjoying the visit of Aunt Doe.
      Until today the weather has been pleasant so perhaps she
      has accompanied you sketching.  If I do not make a mistake
      Tiny returns today; I expect everything will go off very
      pleasantly.  Does she get on with Aunt Doe?  Probably, I
      should think, remembering that she got on nicely with your
      Welsh aunt (whose name escapes me just now).  Let me
      have all the news, won't you.
      I went to the Ball at Hampstead:  Paul came, too.  He asked
      after you and said how good your exhibition was.  He looked
      very well.  The Ball went very well:  many excellent cos-
      tumes and everybody was happy and charming (except for one
      fight).  Wish you had been there, wish you had.  George
      Borchard made most of the arrangements and made an elegant
      job of the decorations and procession (Elizabethan).  Tho'
      the theme was Surelizabethan I just wore my suit.  I slept
      the night at Madeleine's and was woken by Charlie, her great
      cat, staring into my face from a distance of 6 inches.  I
      had the presence of mind to lie quite still.
      I finished Madeleine's introduction to the catalogue in time.
      It is vague as I ahve not seen the actual pieces but I have
      tried to make it serious.  As Empson lives above the place
      where the exhibition is to be held I made it pretty fancy
      in the hope he sees it.
      Also I have finished a first draft of my version of the bal-
      let Isabelle.  I have given it to a woman who knows Anthony
      Tudor and she is going to make a few suggestions.  Then I
      can make a final version.  It was quite a struggle adapting
      the novel.  I think I have hit on one really balletic equiva-
      lent for a buried theme in the novel.  In the climatic dance
      with Isabelle Gerard starts falling and stumbling like Casimir,
      Isabelle's son.
      I miss you very much and I hope that you think of me as I
      think of you; I find my thoughts turning to you all the time.
      I hope you feel confident and happy and not worried.  Are
      you sleeping properly?
      I came to Wimbledon last night.  I thought I might as well
      as I have an early appointment with the dentist today (for
      one hour).  Mother has gone to Brighton for a few days with
      a girl who is convalescing from scarlet fever (daughter of a
      friend of mother's):  tonight I am meeting father in town
      for dinner (if I am allowed to eat by then) and a film.
