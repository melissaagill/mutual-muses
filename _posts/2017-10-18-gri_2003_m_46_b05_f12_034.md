      21 XII 52

      Dearest Sylvia,
      Oh how I miss you.  All day I miss you--
      as I go to town, or get a lecture ready, or
      eat, or read.  I wish so much that you were
      here with me.  At night I am terribly
      restless and sleep very lightly.  I love you
      so much.
      I console myself by thinking of you.  How
      did you enjoy George's party?  I hope
      it was amusing and not maddening.  I
      hope you are now safely and comfortably
      settled in the Rectory with no more traveling
      to do for a bit.
      I keep looking at your new painting--
      which I admire very much (though I am
      sorry you sacrificed your lunch to it).
      Yesterday's lecture went very well:  not
      a lot of people but those who were there--
      very enthusiastic.  I am getting ready
      my Tudor portrait lecture now--inter-
      rupting work for the pleasure of writing
      to you.

      Blackheath
      21 XII 52

      Dearest Sylvia,
      Oh how I miss you. All day I miss you -
      as I go to town, or get a lecture ready, or
      eat, or read. I wish so much that you were
      here with me. At night I am terrible
      restless and sleep very lightly. I love you
      so much.
      I console myself by thinking of you. How
      did you enjoy Georgie-s party? I hope
      it was amusing and not maddening. I
      hope you are now safely comfortably
      settled in the Rectory with no more traveling
      to do for a bit.
      I keep looking at your new painting -
      which I admire very much (though I am
      sorry you sacrificed your lunch to it).
      Yesterday's lecture went very well: not
      a lot of people but those who were there -
      very enthusiastic. I am getting ready
      my Tudor portrait lecture now - inter-
      rupting work for the pleasure of writing
      to you.
