      Though there are many attractions about my coming to Pett for the day I can't
      help feeling there will be a difficult meeting with [unclear][/unclear] in the
      evening. Perhaps I am exaggerating. Tell me if you think I am. If you came to
      town might it not be possible for you to stay with the Phillips or somebody,
      one night? Then we could have 2 days. You could then, perhaps, look at some
      architecture, too, or say you were going to if you need a justification. The
