      [9-2-53]
      Blackheath
      Monday, February.

      Dearest Sylvia,

      Please find enclosed (as they say) your Vogue letter and
      the typed version. I have left out the Art News bit as I
      don't suppose Vogue knows much about that paper. You left
      out one of the pattern no. so I could only leave a space.
      Also I have put in the Kensington Art Gal. cards which may
      interest you. I enclose Art News letter, also.

      The morning the sun is bright and I can see birds darting
      about. Possibly this is a good sign of better weather, or
      maybe only another tease. I hope it is the real thing for
      I am sure that some nice weather would do you so much good.
      How are you now? Better? I do hope that you can say you
      are. Tell me exactly how you are, my love, my rose.

      Oh, something else I should have put in the first para-
      graph. Please find enclosed, your photographs. How charm-
      ing you are in them, charming. I am reluctant to send them
      back but you will need them for Vogue. What about Homes and
      Gardens? Your painting of SYLVIA arrived safely and though
      I do not see quite what you have altered it is much better,
      as you say. I have it on the mantlepiece, now.

      I have a copy of the Matisse poster used for the current
      exh. which I have pinned up. It is charming and bright.
      I do not usually like posters up but I will make an exception
      for this one.

      Thank you for the spelling corrections in Les Jeux Interdits.
      Another one, I think, is carrotte for carotte. I was very ner-
      vous to realise that C was going to see the film on my recom-
      mendation. I hope it will not be another Le Diable au Corps.
      Let me know if he likes it. (I agree about Impinges: thanks.)

      I hope you are sleeping better. My own nights are a little
      odd at present. I always wake up at 8.00, sometimes sleeping
      very lightly and fitfully from about 6.00. And I can never
      get to sleep before about 1.00. So I am having regularly a
      short seven-hour night. I cannot break the pattern, but I
      feel alright...

      The geranium and the hyacinth are both blooming.

      Dearest Sylvia, I love you, I do love you, I adore you,

      I love you,
      Lawrence

      Blackheath
      Monday, February.

      Dearest Sylvia,
      Please find enclosed (as they say) your Vogue letter and
      the typed version.  I have left out the Art News bit as I
      don't suppose Vogue knows much about that paper.  You left
      out one of the pattern no. so I could only leave a space.
      Also I have put in the Kensington Art Gal. cards which may
      interest you.  I enclose Art News letter, also.
      This morning the sun is bright and I can see birds darting
      about.  Possibly this is a good sign of better weather, or
      maybe only another tease.  I hope it is the real thing for
      I am sure that some nice weather would do you so much good.
      How are you now?  Better?  I do hope that you can say you
      are.  Tell me exactlly how are are, my love, my rose.
      Oh, something else I should have put in the first para-
      graph.  Please find enclosed, your photographs.  How charm-
      ing you are in them, charming.  I am reluctant to send them
      back but you will need them for Vogue.  What about Homes and
      Gardens?  Your painting of SYLVIA arrived safely and though
      I do not see quite what you have altered it is much better,
      as you say. I have it on themantlepiece, now.
      I have a copy of the Matisse poster used for the current
      exh. which I have pinne dup.  It is charming and bright.
      I do not usually like posters up but I will make an exception
      for this one.
      Thank you for the spelling corrections in Les Jeux Interdits.
      Another one, I think, is carrotte for carrotte.  I was very ner-
      vous to realise that C was going to see the film on my recom-
      mendations.  I hope it will not be another Le Diable su Corps.
      Let me know if he likes it.  (I agree aobut Impinges:  thanks.)
      I hope you are sleeping better.  My own nights are a little
      odd at present.  I always wake up at 8.00, sometimes sleeping
      very lightly and fitfully from about 6.00.  And I can never
      get to sleep before about 1.00.  So I am having refularly a
      short seven-hour night.  I cannot break the pattern, but I
      feel alright...
      The geranium and hyacinth are both blooming.
      Dearest Sylvia, I love you, I do love you, I adore you,
      I love you,
      Lawrence
