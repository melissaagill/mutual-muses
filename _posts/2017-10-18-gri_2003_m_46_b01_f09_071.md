      THE DEATH OF LOVERS

      Headlines of legend tell
      The dying swan sounds
      Sweeter than the spheres
      Or Saint Cecilia

      But ah to die with you
      My swan of human shape
      Is music that mocks
      The operatic bird

      It is Apollo's tune
      Lovers alone can sound
      Who with their bodies
      Create a lyre of flesh


      THE MUSE

      She is a girl avid for colour
      A classical heroine of stars
      A fountain sipped by wind
      The masked beauty on the stairs

      She is the lady in the maze
      Who fascinates the unicorn
      The bride of January smiling
      The incendiary goddess of the barn

      She is thoughtful and impassioned
      She is the model for the South
      With poems in her hair and underfoot
      With poems on the table on the roof

      THE SHELL

      Held to my ear the shell
      Whispers sea-images,
      The waves scuffling the pebbles
      The blue tree of the distance
      A light-house like a pillar-box

      Its lips have other topics
      And speak of Sylvia,
      As an ambassador
      Speaks of his rare princess
      Whom he announces with a symbol

      27-28 October MCMXLVIII
