      Dearest Sylvia

      I am sorry that you cannot come on
      Wednesday after all but rejoice at the pros-
      pect of seeing you on Sunday or Monday.
      Can you give me an idea of about how
      long you can stay? I must, alas, warn
      you that I am still broke and shall be
      next week, too.

      I will ring up the Kensington Gallery &
      let you know in my next letter what
      they say. I seem to remember that
      they are always rather late in sending
      out the invitations to artists.

      I doubt if I shall be disappointed
      in your new picture: I am sure to like
      the finished work more than the sketch.
      I long to see it, incidentally.

      I enclose my autumn poem which is
      now just about finished. I have not
      written very much of anything lately

      I am sorry that you cannot come on Wednesday after all but rejoice at the prospect of seeing you on Sunday or Monday. Can you give me an idea of about how long you can stay? I must, alas, warn you that I am still broke and shall be next week, too.

      I will ring up the Kensington Gallery and let you know in my next letter what they say. I seem to remember that they are always rather late in sending out the invitation to artists.

      I doubt if I shall be disappointed in your new picture: I am sure to like the finished work more than the sketch. I long to see it, incidentally.

      I enclose my autumn poem which is now just about finished. I have not written very much of anything lately.

      The National Gallery
      Trafalger Square
      London W.C.2
      Dearest Sylvia

      I am sorry that you cannot come on Wednesday after all but rejoice at the pro-spect of seeing you on Sunday and Monday. Can you give me an idea of about how long you can stay ? I must, alas, warn you that I am still broke and shall be next week, too.

      I will ring up the Kensington Gallery & let you know in my next letter what they say. I seem to remember that they are always rather late in sending out the invitations to artists.

      I doubt if I shall be disappointed in your new picture: I am sure to like the finished work more than the sketch. I long to see it, incidentally.

      I enclose my autumn poem which is now just about finished. I have not written very much of anything lately
