      Dearest Sylvia,

           I hope that my letters to you will
      be of more standard size for a bit as
      today I have bought some 'Basildon
      Bond'. This morning's crested envelope
      is replaced by a uniform edition.

           The weather is a little more pleas-
      and than when I first wrote to you so I hope
      this will ease your journey somewhat.
      The rain has stopped, I can hear a bird
      whistling - and so can Pablo, he is
      sitting up with his ears perked up.

           I have been glancing at Castiglione
      during my lunch and I must lend it to
      you soon. You tell me when you are
      ready for it and I shall slip it into
      a Basildon Bond envelope at once. I
      did not realise that he was contempor-
      ary with Giorgione. It may give you
      material for the background of your
      painter.

           Molly looked at a biy of my book
      this morning and seemed to be impress-
      ed. She remarked how little of me
      there was in it - so much quotation,
      for it is The Analysis of Beauty chap-
      ter. So you see I hope your critic-

      Sylvia,<br/><br/>I hope my letters to you will<br/>be of more standard size
      for a bit as<br/>today I have bought some 'Basildon<br/>Bond'.  This morning's
      crested envelope <br/>is replaced by a uniform edition.<br/><br/>The weather
      is a little more pleas-<br/>ant that when I first wrote so I hope<br/>this will
      ease your journey somewhat.<br/>The rain has stopped, I can hear a bird<br/>whistling
      - and so can Pablo, he is<br/>sitting up with his ears perked up.<br/><br/>I
      have been glancing at Castiglione <br/>during my lunch and I must lent it to<br/>you
      soon.  You tell me when you are <br/>ready for it and I shall slip it into<br/>a
      Basildon Bond envelope at once.  I<br/>did not realise that he was contempor-<br/>aary
      with Giorgione.  It may give you <br/>material for the background of your<br/>painter.<br/><br/>Molly
      looked at the bit of my book<br/>this morning and seemed to be impress-<br/>ed.  She
      remarked how little of me<br/>there was in it - so much quotation,<br/>for it
      is The Analysis of Beauty chap-<br/>ter.  So you see I hope your critic-

      14th October 1948

      Dearest Sylvia,

      I hope that my letters to you will be of more standard size for a bit as today I have bought som 'Basildon Bond'. This morning's crested envelope is replaced by this uniform edition.

      The weather is a little more pleasant than when I first wrote do I hope this will ease your journey somewhat. The rain has stopped, I can hear a bird whistling - and so can Pablo, he is sitting up with his ears perked up.

      I have been glancing at Castiglione during my lunch and I must lend it to you soon. You tell me when you are ready for it and I shall slip it into a Basildon Bond envelope at once. I did not realise that he was a contemporary with Giorgione. It may give you material for the background of your painter.

      Molly looked at a bit of my book this morning and seemed to be impressed. She remarked how little of me there was in it - so much quotation for it is The Analysis of Beauty chapter. So you see I hope your critic-
