      Dearest Sylvia
      Here is a copy of my review.
      TG Red Dress is in the hall, with a Pasmore near
      by. Brassiia Seedlings is in the lower room derated -
      or Chase says - to important pictures. They look very well.
      I am  rushing to the shops so I cannot say more
      now, but I wanted you to see the review.
      More soon, my love, my love

      I adore you
