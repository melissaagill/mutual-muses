      (iv)

      Don't forget delicate sleeping spells,
      Nocturnal embassies of repetition:
      Inspect the mores of repetition,
      Say them over until eight next day.
      Keep the humped villain off the spine
      By sleeping spells, adept, well-wishing.

      Be up in time to welcome, not eat,
      Lyrical birds for their chants and feathers
      Praise the world this side the trespass-board,
      Pleasure of Spring, grandeur of trees,
      Braving Winter like sentimental towers.

      (V)

      As ointment of dawn is smeared on roofs
      Pastoral bells tinkle against succubi.
      It has been so quiet - the floating storms
      Rained umbrellas on the hurrying sea.

      Wait - whips of water throng nearby rocks,
      White sabres flash against the barricades:
      Smooth caves worn by more tides than knowledge,
      Convoluted as a conch, are threatened.

      The lassitude of slowest mornings
      When thought would Westernise the sun,
      Incorrigible fountain, leaping
      Buried lands like stairs, three at a time:

      Like charms and ardours of a youth
      Slower to challenge than the glove he owns,
      Or a bridge with ceremony weighed
      Nostalgically tendering her veils to hangers.

      Like being asleep, only to discover
      Your refuge for the night was a giant's shoe:
      Admiring baroque works in a museum
      Where workmen of awake put autumn stiffs.

      Knives reduce the curtain to a trophy,
      Supposing me captive on the divan:
      The aubade grows into a world next door.
      Aubades too often heard from one bed
      Are like whores that only asses fill.

      The lullabye that sends house-holds to sleep
      Cures me of the primitive night:
      September is outside, green or rueful.

      (iv)
      Don't forget delicate sleeping spells,
      Nocturnal embassies of repetition:
      Inspect the mores of repetition,
      Say them over until eight next day.
      Keep the humped villain off the spine
      By sleeping spells, adept, well-wishing.

      Be up in time to welcome, not eat,
      Lyrical birds for their chants and feathers
      Praise the world this side the trespass-board,
      Pleasure of Spring, grandeur of trees,
      Braving Winter like sentimental towers.

      (v)
      As ointment of dawn is smeared on roofs
      Pastoral bells tinkle against succubi.
      It has been so quiet - the floating storms
      Rained umbrellas on the hurrying sea.

      Wait - whips of water throng nearby rocks,
      White sabres flash against the barricades:
      Smooth saves worn by more tides than knowledge,
      Convoluted as a conch, are threatened.

      The lassitude of slowest mornings
      When thought would Westernise the sun,
      Incorrigible fountain, leaping
      Buried lands like stairs, three at a time:

      Like charms and ardours of a youth
      Slower to challenge than the glove he owns,
      Or a bride with ceremony weighed
      Nostalgically tendering her veils to hangers.

      Knives reduce the curtain to a trophy,
      Supposing me captive on the divan:
      The aubade grows into a world next door.
      Aubades too often heard from one bed
      Are like whores that only asses fill.

      The lullaby that sends house-holds to sleep
      Cures me of the primitive night:
      September is outside, green or rueful.
