      at the tate are J. Wright of Derby's The Lighthouse (in very good condition)
      - a nocturnal Italian seacoast, and a big Frances Hodgkins drawing (Gainsborough
      tells me my Ital. letters will be in the next Art News.)<br/><br/>I adore you.  As
      it rained I have not yet watered the plants.  Do not worry your lion is vigilant
      and conscientious (oh dear - how should I spell that).<br/><br/>I looked at
      Daltons today as I came in.  I look forward very much to the day when you will
      paint it (as a pendant, of course, to the Red Lion).<br/><br/>How are your geraniums?  I
      hope they welcomed you as Dandelions should.  I thought of you at the various
      stages of your journey yesterday - I hope you caught a convenient 'bus.<br/><br/>Dearest
      Sylvia, I love you, I adore you.  The better I know you - the more I am with
      you so my desire increases<br/><br/>I love you<br/><br/>Lawrence

      Dennis yesterday and me had a friendly talk.) So that's alright! You forget to mention John Shipp. I am having lunch with him on Friday - he, too, seems very amiable.
      Among the new acquisitions at the Tate are J. Wright of Derby's The Lighthouse (in very good condition) - a nocturnal Italian seacoast, and a big Frances Hodgkins drawing. (Gainsborough tells me my Ital. letter will be in the next Art News.)
      I adore you. As it rained I have not yet watered the plants. Do not worry. Your lion is vigilant & conscientious (oh dear how should I spell that).

      Dearest Sylvia, I love you, I adore you. The letter I [unclear]draw [/unclear]you - the more I am with you so my desire increases.
