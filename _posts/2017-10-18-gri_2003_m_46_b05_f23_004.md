      I hope your lecture went well on Saturday - I expect you went to Wimbleton after it? I have nearly finished my charts of [unclear]markings[/unclear] - I spent all yesterday on them, but I think I can finish in under an hour today - then I must get on with the last half of my lecture.

      Clifford is very disgruntled with me and making the most of his cold - Tiny says he'll probably have it the rest of the winter - his appetite is quite unimpaired however and the intake of starch enormous. It "Armistice Sunday" as Clifford and I still continue to call it
