      SYLVIA BATHING
      argument:  The poet as voyeur, listener, poet, court
      taster, and lover.  In imitation of George Chapman.

      Her footsteps a moon in the water.
      I was not far away and heard
      Water applaud as she advanced.
      A river slapped her bottom.
      Eyelashes of trees were modest
      But could not close my eyes nor hoard
      For dumb material her beauty,
      Who swam wherever eyes could go.

      She sang as she floated tidelessly:
      'I heard a song and it went
      Down the open of my ear
      Like the wanderer of the telling.
      There he spoke and echo bent
      Like a brother answering.
      The hill is a head and while I'm here
      I'll know the mystery of words'.

      There was the Latin poet's girl,
      Julia to an English poet,
      Describing her delighting Ovid,
      Among her atmospheric jars:
      Inhaling from air's ancient pot
      The Latin poet closed his eyes;
      Perfume's invisible spiral
      Entered his head with subtle power.

      Ambiguous as Musidora
      Crouched above her Friday's footprint
      She promises to blood with flesh
      The early nymph above the wier:
      She entertains the mute adorer
      On a night by History hidden;
      He tastes her lips, her mouth's soft spring
      Runs in the barn to drown his fears.

      When I touch you my hands have grown
      Breasts and eyes and teeth and groin:
      Contact is like a girl shouting
      Inside my body's cave until
      Echoes of you are my heart beating.
      And the muscles' loving tremble.
      This time I swim and you are now
      The river feeling the river flow.

      (November 1951)
