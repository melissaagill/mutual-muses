      [Sketch]

      Dearest Lawrence,

      Here is a rather earnest looking "Pusso" very anxious to get it right for he is commissioned to being a laurel wreath for the end of your triumphant tour. I hope it was pleasant.

      Today the King died so you know the date Feb. 6th. You must know the news! I expect Lionel will appreciate so timely an exit, so that the new Queen will begin her reign as the year waxes.  Will Hetty buy any [unclear][/unclear] veils do you think?

      My painting is going well. I think that I should be able to get to town by Thursday week- perhaps Wednesday. I'll do my best!

      I have done dressing-making
