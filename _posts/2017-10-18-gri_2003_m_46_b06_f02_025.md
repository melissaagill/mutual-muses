      Tuesday NG Dearest Sylvia
      This is a hasty note to say that
      I will catch the 4:20 from Claring
      X on Friday, which is due at
      6:10 - I have just heard my
      Tuesday 4th August lecture is cancelled,
      so I shall not have to leave so
      early - not until late Tuesday,
      in fact.

      I am sorry to have to ask you but
      can you send me the 95 - submission
      fee for the Brit in Watercolor
      exhibition, as I am short (though
      not broke).
      Love you
      Lawrence
