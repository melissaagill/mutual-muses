      London to see Doris who is being made well enough to go home to die. They need her bed. So Tiny will come home for the weekend. Which will be very nice. God knows when she will be here as usual!

      By the way, if you can easily get hold of one, procure a catalogue of the "100 Years of British Taste" M. says there are [unclear]ammonia[/unclear] comments by contemporary critics - he borrowed [unclear]at[/unclear] catalogue.

      I did some more of the Cricket Field this morning including the seat and the hedge on the left of the picture so it won't be long - but it's so misty I cannot start as soon as I would like. There was really rather a cold north wind this morning - it seemed to come straight up Elms Lane at my back.

      I love you dearest Lawrence,
      I love you,
      Sylvia
