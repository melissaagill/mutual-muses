      told me that they had a telgram
      from you this morning, as, quite
      irrationally, I felt rather worried
      as I did not hear from you on
      Saturday - but I realize that you
      must be most busy, I hope
      you are well.
      I enclose a cutting from "Times" on
      the Dobson which may interest you.
      I have been struggling with
      "Kissing" but have not resolved it
      yet. I hope to start on an oil
      of spring flowers tomorrow - I have
      something in mind. You will be
      pleased to hear that after some
      discussion and explanation Tiny
      likes the "Poet in the Garden" very
      much, and she is most encouraging
      which is a "good thing" so I
      miss it when I am with-out
