      25th September  Dearest Sylvia
      This is little more than a note to give you my love - &
      my thanks for the SUPERB drawing of Warrily - so well-drawn &
      deliciously inventive.
      It is 7:20 in the evening.  I have just returned from
      London where I have the Whistles lecture - with, I think,
      success.  In a few moments the post will go but
      I did not want to leave you without any thing from my
      paw.  Forgive me but I have been fairly busy -
      right up to the last moment nor will I have much leis-
      ure until after Thursday's lecture.
      My beautiful painter - your new self-portrait is
      very good, very good indeed.  I have studied it for
      several days.  (I came back Sunday from Wimbledon.)

      Must run to the post in the heavy rain now,  More
      tomorrow.  I love you
      Lawrence

      25th September

      Dearest Sylvia
      This is little more than a note to give you my love--& my thanks for the SUPERB drawing of Wassily--so well-drawn & deliciously inventive.

      IC in 7.20 in the evening I have just returned from London where I gave the Whistler lecture--with, I think, success. In a few moments the part will go but I did not want to leave you without any thing from my paw. Forgive me but I have been fairly busy--right up to the last moment nor will I have much leisure until after Thursday's lecture.

      My beautiful painter--your new self-portrait is very good, very good indeed. I have studied it for several days. (I came back Sunday from Wimbledon.)

      Must run to the port in the heavy rain now. More tomorrow.

      I love you
      Lawrence

      more than a note to give you my love--& my thanks for the SUPERB drawing of
      Wassily--so well-drawn & deliciously inventive.<br/><br/>IC in 7.20 in the evening
