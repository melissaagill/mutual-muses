      2    as it is so tiring standing--o I find
      it so.  I think I worked just
      under 2 hours.
      I love your poems.  What a splendid
      poet you are, how rich your letters
      and I do enjoy the 2 portraits of
      Dandylion.
      I wonder if you will do any
      drawings.  I like the idea of the
      guard with a flag as you sketched
      it.  I love that kind of composition!
      and I have noticed in your sketches
      how well you compose-it shouldn't
      be otherwise as you have such a
      well-developed sense of balance and
      rhythm.  By the way I hope
      you appreciate my mistake above!
      "Wonderful" as a shortened form
      of "wonder if you"!
      We did have one nice shower
      for the beans.  I managed to bathe
      yesterday though I am still not

      I love your poems - what a splendid
      poet you are, how [unclear]neat[/unclear] your letters
      and I do enjoy the 2 portraits of
      Dandy-lion.
      I wonder if you will do day
      drawings - I like the idea of the
      guard with a flag as you sketched
      it - I love that kind of composition!
      And I have noticed in your sketches
      how well you compose - it couldn't
      be otherwise as you have such a
      well-developed sense of balance and
      rhythm. By they way I hope
      you appreciate my mistake above!
      "Wonderful" as a shortened form
      of "wonder if you"!
      We did have one nice shower
      for the beans. I managed to bathe
      yesterday though I am still not
