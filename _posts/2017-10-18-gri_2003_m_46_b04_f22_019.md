      I have not quite finished the cricket field view - but very nearly - I think it most successful. I have taken great care. I think I may sell it. It has been much admired on the [unclear]sight[/unclear] - by Josephine (Horsewoman's) [unclear]est[/unclear] while landlord and his wife - (a Mrs. Pengelly who is about to leave the district) for 10 [unclear]gns[/unclear] - he also wants a pendant - the  [unclear]Mill[/unclear] - I think - he and his wife are coming on Monday to inspect.

      I enclose the London Group Form - I wonder if you could possibly take and "Ajax and the Poet" on Monday or Tuesday? What do you think - I enclose a P.O. Labels etc. I should be glad if you could possibly.

      Rejections have to be collected on Friday and Saturday!

      In haste as I have the Savages to dinner.

      I love you
      Sylvia

      I have not quite finished the cricket field view--but very nearly--I think it most successful- I have taken great care.  I think I may sell it - It has been much admired on the sight by Josephine[unclear] (Horeswomans)[/unclear] erstwhile landlord and his wife - (or Mrs Pengelly who is about to leave the district) for 1- [unclear]gnh[/unclear] - he also wants a pendent - the [unclear]aull[/unclear] - I think - he and his wife are coming on Monday to inspect.
      I enclose the London Group [unclear]Loem[/unclear] - I wonder if you could possibly take "Ajax and the Poet" on Monday or Tuesday?  What do you think - I enclose a P.O. labels etc.  I should be glad if you could possibly.
      Rejections have to be collected on Friday and Saturday!
      In haste as I have the Sawyers to dinner.  I love you.
