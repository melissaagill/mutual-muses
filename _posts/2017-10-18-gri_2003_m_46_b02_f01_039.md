      Dearest Sylvia,

      We said on the phone that 'heads' were working against your heart at Pett.  Thinking it over I am not so sure.  I think reason is on our side as well as passion.  If you were not to come now doubt and frustration would cling forever to what remained of our love.  It is I think reasonable to come to me for three months.  If compromises are to be made they ought to come after that - not before.  I want the chance to make you happy, free ENTIRELY from Michael, the associations of Pett, Tiny's projected guild, and so on.  I know it will be difficult for Michael but it was difficult for you for a long time.  You say in your letter he can't understand 'why I should leave him'.  Good Heavens, what more does he have to do to you?  I should have thought he had done more than enough against you and against Eros.

      If you will come I ask one more thing.  Do not, if you can help it, come with the mental reservation of a compromise being reached soon.  Try whole-heartedly for not less than three-months to be with me.  Please, do this, sweetheart.  I love you so deeply.  Come to Blackheath and come soon.

      said on the phone that 'heads' were working a-\ngainst your heart at Pett. Thinking
      it was over I am not\nso sure. I think reason is on our side as well as pas-\nsion.

      remained of our love. It is\nI think reasonable to come to me for three months.
      If  \ncompromises are to be made they ought to come after that - \nnot before.
      I want the change to make you happy, free\nENTIRELY from Michael, and the associations

      for Michael but it was difficult for you for a long\ntime. You say in your letter
      he can't understand 'why\nI should leave him'. Good Heavens, what more does
      he\nhave to do to you? I should have thought he had done \nmore than enough
      against you and against Eros.\n\nIf you will come I ask one more thing. Do not,
      if\nyou can help it, come with the mental reservation of \na compromise being
      reached soon. Try whole-heartedly\nfor not less than three-months to be with
      me. Please,\ndo this, dearest. I love you so deeply. Come to \nBlackheath and
