      Blackheath
      Wednesday

      Dearest Sylvia,

      Last night I went to the AIA and the Committee meeting lasted for 2 and a half hours. I am going to another one tomorrow. I think this one will be shorter as a lecture by Ruhemann on cleaned pictures starts at eight. Am I not the lion of love, sitting on such committees for my cat. Forgive my former slackness...

      This morning I have been working on Joyce, in bed, because I am tired. It progresses very slowly. I am turning into a slow-coach-erie.

      Have you painted any Spring watercolours? Gay yellow daffodillies are out here, looking very pretty and fresh.

      I have no slides for this evening but I hope the slices of Mrs Smith will make up for my omission. Would you were coming...

      I love you so much. I think of you all the time, lovingly, sometimes fearfully, always adoringly. My sweet Minerva, how I hate the separation and complications attendant on our love. But - how I love you.

      I am happy to be writing poems for you and about you again. There had been a dull patch which seems to be breaking as the Spring advances. How you inspire me to write.

      When you wait beside the unicorn,
      Symbol of touch, your fingers
      Resting on the spiral horn,
      I long to touch, my hand hungers.

      When a mirror holds your face
      I long to touch what you see,
      And let my eyes in that place
      Be fingers on your cheek and knee.

      Sight and touch are not such enemies
      As the unicorn and lion:
      Lady, permit the unity
      Of sight and touch in one design.

      Oh, it is nearly two, and I am hungry. Lion must cook some blue antelope.

      I love you - I adore you
      Lawrence

      Dearest Sylvia,

      Last night I went to the AIA and the Committee meeting lasted for 2 and a half hours. I am going to another one tomorrow. I think this one will be shorter as a lecture by Ruhemann on clean-ed pictures starts at eight. Am I not the lion of love, sit-ting on such committees for my cat. Forgive my former slack-ness...

      This morning I have been working on Joyce, in bed, because I am tired. It progresses very slowly. I am turning into a slow-coach-erie.

      Have you painted any Spring watercolours? Gay yellow daffo-dillies are out here, looking very pretty and freshh.

      I have no slides for this evening but i hope the slices of Mrs Smith will make up for my ommission. Would you were com-ing...

      I love you so much. I think of you all the time, lovingly, sometimes fearfully, always adoringly. My sweet Minerva, how I hate the separation and complications attendant on our love. But - how I love you.

      I am happy to be writing poems for you and about you again. There had been a dull patch which seems to be breaking as the Spring advances. How you inspire me to write.

      When you wait beside the unicorn,
      Symbol of touch, your fingers

      I long to touch, my hang hungers.

      When a mirror holds your face
      I long to touch what you see,

      you wait beside the unicorn,<br/>Symbol of touch, your fingers<br/>Resting on
      the spiral horn,<br/>I long to touch, my hang hungers.<br/><br/>When a mirror

      such enemies<br/>As the unicorn and lion:<br/>Lady, permit the unity<br/>Of
      sight and touch in one design.<br/><br/>Oh it is nearly two, and I am hungry.
      Lion must cook some blue antelope.<br/><br/>I love you - I adore you<br/>Lawrence
