      garden this afternoon - it wasn't quite so hot today as it was yesterday, which was wonderfully summery, but it was lovely.

      Desiree is coming to sit tomorrow which will be nice - I will fit in your message when convenient.

      I think Carol is coming to stay in the village for half-term, Clifford and Tiny are cross and would like to prevent it, which is I think unreasonable - I shall be very interested to see her - and perhaps glad - ! Poor Carol - I have a soft spot for her though I expect she thinks I'm an old fool!

      I love you so much and long to see you - I have dreams of trying to find you, and waiting for you - then just catching glimpses of you round the corner and being unable to move towards you.

      I love you so, I love you
      Sylvia
