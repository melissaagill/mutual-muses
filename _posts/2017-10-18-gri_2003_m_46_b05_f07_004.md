      4.
      to write the Portrait which I started early in the year and abandoned. I will start it again and make it the equivalent of a painting by you, if I can. I hope I do not trespass too far on your medium - my rose, my swan.

      I have written to Gibson about seeing the Giorgione next week. And to the Barber Institute.

      Here is Dandy at work last night.

      P.S. I nearly sent this to the Barber Institute. Did you get a letter for Young? Sorry!

      I love you,
      Lawrence
