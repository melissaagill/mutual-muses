      Because you are their climate,
      Because they never crinkle,
      In your summer-equilibrium.

      Desire is not a Rhine Castle
      Astoundingingly maintained on ice
      Because I am your climate
      And melt the iceburg prisms
      Into rivers where we swim.
      The sun is our simple mirror.
      Around our love what paradox is felt?

      SONG

      I met an old man on the path.
      Of Time he had this rule:
      'It is the snow, my beard,
      'It is the harvest, my hands.
      'Time is a pastoral'.

      I met a man in the square.
      And he said: 'I believe
      'Time is stepping stones,
      'Like coins to the future's bank.
      'Time is progressive'.

      'Time is the lover's name',
      I sat on the bed and sighed:
      'For the waste land between kisses,
      For the wall that stonily delays
      'The union of the lovers on each side'.

      WORDS AS THINGS

      Who is the primitive that can suppose
      The old gun on the wall, the anecdote
      Of metal in the genre scene, is the gun
      To drop a panting animal on the floor:
      As well believe that musical objects
      Shiny in a still life can be blown
      To charm the fear which is not lenient
      In the broken lustre of dead silence.
      Well, I am victim of the sign, the bear deceived
      By rumours of honey on the sunlit floor:
      For as I write the letters Sylvia,
      Your shadow and perfume mock new disbelief.

      Until Saturday when we actually meet and touch remember
      how much I adore you.  I shall write again tomorrow.
      I love you,
      Lawrence
