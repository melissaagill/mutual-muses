         AT HOME
      A mirror puts they sky
      in the corner of my room.
      A bed imports the east.

      The houses on the hill
      hide the earth and soil
      the washing of the gods.

      When I watch the sky
      in the angle of my room
      east becomes west.

      The brick chin of the hill
      excedes the hidden soil
      and the buried gods.

         WINTER
      Frost is Paduan on grass,
      the feet shy from metal.

      Winter welds the garden
      as it remakes the town.

      Light alone is solid
      in tangible rays and plates.

      Buildings are shades we tried
      half-successfully to conjure.

         IN PUTNEY, LATELY

      The doubts of daughters are refined.
      On Swinburne's hill no stately glide
      of king-size women, sure to to/wer.
      Whips that do not whistle down
      are only hair at the temples-
      adorable maybe, that only.

      No hamadryads in those heads,
      though wooden their character.
      Miss myth of nineteen fifty two.

                               (1952)

      AT HOME

      A mirror puts the sky
      in the corner of my room.
      A bed imports the cast.

      The houses on the hill
      hide the earth and soil
      the washing of the gods

      When I watch the sky
      in the angle of my room
      east becomes west.

      The brick chin of the hill
      excedes the hidden soil
      and the buried gods.

      WINTER

      Frost is Paduan on grass,
      the feet shy from metal.

      Winter welds the garden
      as it remakes the town.

      Light alone is solid
      in tangible rays and plates.

      Buildings are shades we tried
      half-successfully to conjure.

      IN PUTNEY, LATELY

      The doubts of daughters are refined.
      On Swinburn's hill no stately glide
      of king-size women, sure to tower.
      Whips that do not whistle down
      are only hair at the temples -
      adorale maybe, that only.

      No hamadryads in those heads,
      though wooden their character.
      Miss myth of nineteen fifty two.
