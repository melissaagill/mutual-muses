      Wimbledon

      My dearest Sylvia

      I am delighted to hear you're painting and it sounds a nice subject.  And I'm glad too that Michael is working, as you put it 'at great speed' - I'm sure that is a good thing for him.

      Do you know of any good poets in fiction;  any nice plausible ones, that is - or even plausibly romantic ones?  I have tried to think of some but cannot.  Would Michael know of any?  It is only a train of thought at present but I might follow it up one day with amusing results possibly in an essay.

      The repetitions of the birthday poem were intended to sug-gest that there is no element of loss in your birthday - no loss to time that is.  Three goodbye stanzas and three hello ones; the same images repeated with differences to suggest the contin-uing structure.

      I'm afraid at present there's no definite news about Mother as Patron.  Father is worried about money and cannot pay out four pounds odd for a picture though he has just had a heating thing installed at about a hundred pounds.  Mother however is interested and something may come of it.

      Paul and I discovered a shop in Brixton the other day called 'Black and Jutting' and a friend of Molly's has a friend who knows two ladies named Miss Cockshut and Lady Hayter.  Really.  What would Flugel say about the professional tie-up of the former pair?  So with names like these I don't care if I am called Hetty Remington.

      I am so glad that you are happy.  I love you.

      This is the end of the prose and I turn into...

      Hers was a spear the clouds had fallen on.
      Goddess, both savage and erudite.
      And who would not decide Marsyas' fate
      Ample reward for touching her invention.
      Who would not covet immobility
      Mirrored forever in the fatal shield.
      Arachne who, we say,  the Goddess killed
      Fears to take vengeance on her statuary.
      But when the earliest rays of Phoebus
      Enters her temple and warms the Goddess,
      Then I forget all antique myths which are
      Like inessential robes of revery
      That fall (now eyesight wakes) below her knee.
      Minerva's body.  Symbol's vanquisher.

      My dearest Sylvia

         I am delighted to hear you're painting and it sounds a nice subject.   And I'm glad too that Michael is working, as you pt it 'at great speed' - I'm sure that is a good thing for him.

         Do you know any good poets in fiction;   any nice plausible ones, that is - or even plausibly romantic ones?   I have tried to think of some but cannot.   Would Michael know of any?   It is only a train of thought at present but I might follow it up one day with amusing results possibly in an essay.

         The repetitions of the birthday poem  poem were intended to suggest that there is no element of loss in your birthday - no loss to time that is.   Three goodbye stanzas and three hello ones;   the same images repeated with differences to suggest the continuing structure.

         I'm afraid at present there's no definite news about Mother as Patron.   Father is worried about money and cannot pay cut four pounds odd for a picture though he has just had a heating thing installed at about a hundred pounds.   Mother however is interested and something may come of it.

         Paul and I discovered a shop in Brixton the other day called 'Black and Jutting' and a friend of Molly's has a friend who knows two ladies named Miss Cockshut and Lady Hayter.   Really.   What would Flugel say about the professional tie-up of the former pair? So with names like these about I don't care if I am  called Hetty Remington.

         I am so glad you are happy.   I love you.

         This is the end of the prose and I turn into...

                     Hers was a spear the clouds had fallen on.
                     Goddess, both savage and erudite.
                     And who would not decide Marsya's fate
                     Ample reward for touching her invention.
                     Who would not covet immobility
                     Mirrored forever in the fatal shield.
                     Arachne who, we say, the Goddess killed
                     Fears to take vengence on her statury.
                     But when the earliest ray of Phoebus
                     Enters her temple and warms the Goddess,
                      Then I forget all antique myths which are
                       Like inessential robes of revery
                       That fall (now eyesight wakes) below her knee.
                        Minerva's body.   Symbol's vanquisher.

    clean_transcription: My dearest Sylvia<br/><br/>   I am delighted to hear you're
      painting and it sounds a nice subject.   And I'm glad too that Michael is working,
      as you pt it 'at great speed' - I'm sure that is a good thing for him.<br/><br/>   Do
      you know any good poets in fiction;   any nice plausible ones, that is - or
      even plausibly romantic ones?   I have tried to think of some but cannot.   Would
      Michael know of any?   It is only a train of thought at present but I might
      follow it up one day with amusing results possibly in an essay.<br/><br/>   The
      repetitions of the birthday poem  poem were intended to suggest that there is
      no element of loss in your birthday - no loss to time that is.   Three goodbye
      stanzas and three hello ones;   the same images repeated with differences to
      suggest the continuing structure.<br/><br/>   I'm afraid at present there's
      no definite news about Mother as Patron.   Father is worried about money and
      cannot pay cut four pounds odd for a picture though he has just had a heating
      thing installed at about a hundred pounds.   Mother however is interested and
      something may come of it.<br/><br/>   Paul and I discovered a shop in Brixton
      the other day called 'Black and Jutting' and a friend of Molly's has a friend
      who knows two ladies named Miss Cockshut and Lady Hayter.   Really.   What would
      Flugel say about the professional tie-up of the former pair? So with names like
      these about I don't care if I am  called Hetty Remington.<br/><br/>   I am so
      glad you are happy.   I love you.<br/><br/>   This is the end of the prose and
      I turn into...<br/><br/>               Hers was a spear the clouds had fallen
      on.<br/>               Goddess, both savage and erudite.<br/>               And
      who would not decide Marsya's fate<br/>               Ample reward for touching
      her invention.<br/>               Who would not covet immobility<br/>               Mirrored
      forever in the fatal shield.<br/>               Arachne who, we say, the Goddess
      killed<br/>               Fears to take vengence on her statury.<br/>               But
      when the earliest ray of Phoebus<br/>               Enters her temple and warms
      the Goddess,<br/>                Then I forget all antique myths which are<br/>                 Like
      inessential robes of revery<br/>                 That fall (now eyesight wakes)
      below her knee.<br/>                  Minerva's body.   Symbol's vanquisher.
