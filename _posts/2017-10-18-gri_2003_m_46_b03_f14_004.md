      Dearest Lawrence,
      Thank you for your delightful letter so amply and beautifully illustrated. And for your paper on Berthe Morisot. Which is very subtle and perceptive I think. I am so glad that you can enjoy Blackheath with contentment  it is nice to be free to work- even alone- if one has a lot of ideas. I am delighted to hear that you have finished Gilpin and hope you will soon have finished Hogarth. I very much look foreward to hearing the rest of the Chapter of Sigismondo - the psycho-analytical one.
      I did not do much work yesterday I think I am still rather tired I had a bad head-ache - eyes and jaw - I went to church with Jimmy in the morning, and in the afternoon which was hot and sunny lay in the garden naked and sunbathed. After tea I worked on my garden picture which progresses nicely.

      on Berthe Morisot. Which is very subtle and perceptive I think. I am so glad
      that you can enjoy Blackheath with contentment  it is nice to be free to work-
      even alone- if one has a lot of ideas. I am delighted to hear that you have
      finished Gilpin and hope you will soon have finished Hogarth. I very much look
      foreward to hearing the rest of the Chapter of Sigismondo - the psycho-analytical
      one.<br/>I did not do much work yesterday I think I am still rather tired I
      had a bad head-ache - eyes and jaw - I went to church with Jimmy in the morning,
      and in the afternoon which was hot and sunny lay in the garden naked and sunbathed.
      After tea I worked on my garden picture which progresses nicely.
