      [unclear][/unclear][unclear][/unclear]II
      Ricky has given me that fascinating book on classic-
      cal paintings.  It is my price for the Hogarth article,
      for his Diploma at the R.C.A.  He wanted to pay me cash
      but I thought that undignified.  Don't you agree?

      I bought some gammon this morning at Sainsbury's
      so I shall not harm.

      'The Herm' is increasingly attractive and I look at
      it daily with greater pride and pleasure than ever.
      Do tell me, precisely, what canvases you want, beside
      the 24 x 24.  Then I can get them this week.  In town
      if necessary.

      When you come will you bring your watch?  Mine has
      been stopping frequently and it needs cleaning.  As I
      have no other time piece I thought I would take it in
      if you could bring your watch.  It is bad for watches
      to work when dirty, they told me in the shop, when they
      examined it for me.  Do you mind?

      Please write me a nice, long letter.  I adore you,
      my sweetest creature, my ravishing love, my only love.

      I adore you so well,
      Oh Sylvia I love you
      Lawrence

      Dandy, at the N.G. on
      Saturday between
      Duty and Pleasure
