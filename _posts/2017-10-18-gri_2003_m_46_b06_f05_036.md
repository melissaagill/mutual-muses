      Dearest Sylvia
      I read the play at Magdas' on Monday and I am relieved to say that the reaction like yours was favourable. Carter thought his idea really amounted to something in my treatment. Frank criticised particular lines but implicit in what he said was the willigness to set it to music. Magda liked it; John said 'excellent' twice. Your critic-ism of my feeble sense of plot must have impressed me, because I took trouble here and everybody liked its shape.
      So that's it. It remains to get TV to accept it. I finish the script and that is what it is sold on (if it is sold) along with Frank's and Carter's reputation. Frank is willing to work with me on pro-jects for sound, too. I have one idea for this - and I propose work-ing out several rough treatments. I am pleased to have the chance of writing this kind of thing. IC confirms our theory of adaptability of craftmanship and it may tap my low side. However, I can imagine your reaction to this so let me, I hope, reassure you with a new poem (a real one). Do not think there is iconoclasm in it, tho' it is called Against Pygmalion. Pygmalian is the dead work of art the artist wishes alive; Frank-enstein is the work of art alive with base energies the artist wishes dead.

      When the rain comes, when the new slain
      take life from somewhere unsupposed
      and threatens with its life my room,
      my habits in a word, I can run
      past early refugees to peace
      in silence and disgust. Remain
      locked up girl in the paged plinth.
      Dislocate the springs of my bed:
      rest your fertile arms in my hair;
      but only be a muse and not
      the poem escaping from me,

      Blackheath
      Dearest Sylvia
      I read the play at Magda's on Monday and I am relieved to say that the reaction like yours was favourable. Carter thought his idea really amounted to something in my treatment. Frank criticised particular lines but implicit in what he said was the willingness to set it to music. Magda liked it; John said 'excellent' twice. Your criticism of my feeble sense of plot must have impressed me, because I took trouble here and everybody liked its shape.
      So that's it. It remains to get TV to accept it. I finish the script and [unclear][/unclear]is what is sold on (if it is sold) along with Frank's and Carter's reputation. Frank is willing to work with me on projects for sound too. I have one idea for this- and I propose working out several rough treatments. I am pleased to have the chance of writing this kind of thing. It confirms our theory of adaptability of craftsmanship and it may tap my low side. Heavens, I can imagine your reaction to this so let me, I hope, reassure you with a new poem ( a real one). Do not think there is iconoclasm in it, tho' it is called Against Pygmalion. Pygmalion is the dead work of art the artist wished alive; Frankenstein is the work of art alive with base energies the artist wishes dead.
      When the rain comes, when the new [unclear]skin[/unclear]
      take life from somewhere unsupposed
      and threatens it with its life my room,
      my habits in a world, I can run
      past early refugees to peace
      in silence and disgust. Remain
      locked up girl on the [unclear]poged/unclear]plinths.
      Dislocate the springs of my bed:
      rest your fertile arms in my hair;
      but only be a muse and not
      the poem escaping from me,
