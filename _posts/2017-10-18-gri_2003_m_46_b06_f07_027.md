      play, so I must resume work on that.
      I met Donald Parsons again. He invited me to Sark, Channel Islands, where he is living until the Autumn. However, I can't go, of course.
      How have you been sleeping? I do hope well.
      Did you see Cooper [unclear]crocking[/unclear] David in The Listener this week? I wonder if he'll reply next week? I expect so.
