      one tends to exaggerate the
      sweep to make up for the lack of
      colour.
      By the way I wonder if you would
      ask the Kensington Gallery (phone)
      if they intend to invite me as
      I haven't received a form and time
      is getting on if I have to send
      it to you.  I wanted to send
      in my Church Yard picture - I
      might perhaps send it by train
      if I don't get up in time to bring
      it.  I hope to come on Sunday
      or Monday next but I am not
      sure.  If I came by train
      Monday would be alright -
      A more lucid letter tomorrow
      I love you
      Sylvia.
