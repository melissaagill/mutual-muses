      I am writing this in bed (11.45) and am going to post it early tomorrow at the same time as the book though separately. I think I'll lie down now and I'm sure to dream of you all night. I'll think consciously of you, then gradually as I become drowsy you will become free of the force of gravity and appear in exuberant disguise of fantastic design and exotic origin. No matter to what length you will go I shall always recognise your disguise; why is this you may ask? Because the disguises are not intended to deceive but only to delight, both yourself and me. The child part of both of us can have full play, Sylvia. One dream will beget the next and so on. In the morning you will become less wild, your meta-
      morphoses less spectacular, life-size. I shall still tremble with delight and surprise at you; the morning light cannot take away the sparkle of the dream though you won't be there. Oh, to wake and see my dream with me still. I love you, dearest Sylvia, my only Sylvia, Sylvia adorable, Sylvia, Sylvia.
      All, all my love
      Lawrence

      I am writing this in bed (11.45) and am going to post it early tomorrow at the same time as the book though separately. I think i'll lie down now and I am sure to dream of you all night. I'll think consciously of you, then gradually as i become drowsy you will become free of the force of gravity and appear in exuberant disguises of fantastic design and erotic origin. No matter to what lengths you will go I shall always recognise you disguise; why is this you may ask? Because the disguises are not intended to deceive but only to delight, both yourself and me. The child part of both of us can have full play, Sylvia. One dream will beget the next and so on. In the morning you will become less wild, your metamorphoses less spectacular, life size, I shall still tremble with delight and surprise at you: the morning light cannot take away the sparkle of the dream though you won't be there. Or, to wake and see my dream wilt me still  I love you dearest sylvia, my only sylvia, sylvia adorable sylvia sylvia.
      All, all my love
      Lawrence
