      I have just finished my lecture on classical pictures which I enjoyed and now I must go to the [unclear][/unclear] Galleries to see Buffet & Helion before rushing to Banstead for the last lecture of the twelve. I can't believe they will actually  have me again. Indeed I anticipate a rest from them. On the way home I must read about Rubens for Friday's lecture!
