      3 Haise to say that he is so impressed by Clifford's articles and reviews in Sex News that he wants him to collaborate by adding an article to a book that he, Flugel, is writing - isn't that splendid?
      Clifford tells me that one of his class, is to remote and dull a place as Seaford said he had read your article in "World Review", and discussed it with Clifford. He said that he knew you and had your photograph in his pocket!
      I wish I was coming on Monday!
      Look after yourself, dearest one, I am so excited about all your activities next week!
      I love you, my Apollo
      I love you
      Sylvia
