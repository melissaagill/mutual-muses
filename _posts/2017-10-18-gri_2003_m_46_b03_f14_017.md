      Pett  10.7.50
      Dearest Lawrence,
      Thank you so much for your two delightful letters with the charming drawings of Dandelion.  I am delighted to hear that my letters take so short a time - I am amazed - perhaps they send them to New Haven.  Both yours came to-day - one this afternoon.
      I'm so glad that you had a good journey - and sorry it was crowded. Your "time-space" theory is both wise and ingenious - that surely should stimulate some poems; but I expect at present you are "resting" for you must be rather tired, and acclimatizing yourself.  I'm so glad that [unclear]Mme. Coillcams[/unclear] is looking after the flowers - how very kind of her.  I am delighted by [unclear]Mme.[/unclear] Brock's appreciation - I only wish that it was something which you liked better!  As [unclear]Tiny[/unclear] said - what a pity it was chocolate!

      with the charming drawings of Dandelion. I am delighted to hear that my letters
      take so short a time - I am amazed - perhaps they send them to New Haven. Both
      yours came to-day - one this afternoon.  I'm so glad that you had a good journey
      - and sorry it was crowded. Your "time-space" theory is both wise and ingenious
      - that surely should stimulate some poems; but I expect at present you are "resting"
      for you must be rather tired, and acclimatizing yourself. I'm so glad that Mrs.[unclear][/unclear]
      Williams is looking after the flowers - how very kind of her. I am delighted
      by Mme[unclear][/unclear] Brock's appreciation - I only wish that it was something
      which you liked better! As [unclear]Tiny[/unclear] said - what a pity it was
      chocolate!

    clean_transcription: Dearest lawrence, Thank you so much for your two delightful
      letters with the charming drawings of Dandelion. I am delighted to hear that
      my letters take so short a time - I am amazed - perhaps they send them to New
      Haven. Both yours came to-day - one this afternoon.  I'm so glad that you had
      a good journey - and sorry it was crowded. Your "time-space" theory is both
      wise and ingenious - that surely should stimulate some poems; but I expect at
      present you are "resting" for you must be rather tired, and acclimatizing yourself.
      I'm so glad that Mrs. Williams is looking after the flowers - how very kind
      of her. I am delighted by Mme Brock's appreciation - I only wish that it was
      something which you liked better! As Tiny said - what a pity it was chocolate!
