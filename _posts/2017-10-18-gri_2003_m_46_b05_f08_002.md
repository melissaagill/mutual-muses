      Blackheath
      Sunday
      Dearest Sylvia,
      Lion has been busy writing since breakfast.  It is now 3.00
      in the afternoon and I am going to post this letter on the way
      to Wimbledon to visit my parents.  I shall stay the night and
      spend Monday with them, returning here tomorrow evening.
      On Tuesday Anthony Hill is coming here as I mentioned Vic-
      tor Pasmore has invited us both round to dinner in the evening
      so that should be very pleasant I think.
      Yesterday's lecture on Manet was very well-attended.  About
      70 people.  I find Manet most interesting nowadays:  I think
      I was right about his drawing but he is still a fascinating art-
      ist.  I have done a lot of work on the Bar (more than I can put
      into a letter without turning it into a lecture) so I shall save
      it till I see you.
      The weather here is thundery and sunny alternately.  And at
      Pett?  I hope you are having a pleasant time with M and MMGG.
      Did you have a nice time with the Savages on Friday?  I'm sure
      you did.
      Here is a poem for you:

      The clouds are waistcoats dressing up the sky,
      Sweet labels on the curving blue bottle,
      Tufts of a Christian angel's softest wing:
      But being alone
      Summer's a doublecross.

      Rain in my face, slipping through air's net,
      Each crystal oval happy with rebirth,
      Dew on our morning, come on with the rain:
      The winter with you
      Has a summer charm.

      The fact of you, of being there with you,
      Remakes the winter, softs the balustrade
      Of ice, and lacking you the summer is
      A lock without your key,
      A hidden sun.

      And here follows a poem about art:

      Dearest Sylvia,

      Lion has been busy writing since Breakfast.  It is now 3.00 in the afternoon and I am going to post this letter on the way to Wimbledon to visit my parents.  I shall stay the night and spend monday with them, returning here tomorrow evening.

      To witness the mutation of a fruit (The word our editor's the need our own) The ripeness on the round, he plants a pip, Lies down until he can sleep in the shade, Starves till the fruit bubbles on the green.

      [3.8.52]
      Blackheath
      Sunday
      Dearest Sylvia,
      Lion has been busy writing since breakfast. It is now 3.00
      in the afternoon and I am going to post this letter on the way
      to Wimbledon to visit my parents. I shall stay the night and
      spend Monday with them, returning here  tomorrow evening.
      On Tuesday Anthony Hill is coming here as I mentioned. Vic-
      tor Pasmore has invited us both round to dinner in the evening
      so that should be very pleasant I think.
      Yesterday's lecture on Manet was very well-attended. About
      70 people. I find Manet most interesting nowadays: I think
      I was right about his drawing but he is still a fascinating art-
      ist. I have done a lot of work on the Bar (more than I can put)
      into a letter without turning it into a lecture) so I shall save
      it till I see you.
      The weather here is thundery and sunny alternately. And at
      Pett? I hope you are having a pleasant time with M and MMGG.
      Did you have a nice time with the Savages on Friday? I'm sure
      you did.
      Here is a poem for you:
      The clouds are waistcoats dressing up the sky,
      Sweet labels on the curving blue bottle,
      Tufts of a Christian angel's softest wing:
      But being alone
      Summer's a doublecross.
      Rain in my face, slipping through air's net,
      Each crystal oval happy with rebirth,
      Dew on our mornings, come on with the rain:
      The winter with you
      Has a summer charm.
      The fact of you, of being there with you,
      Remakes the winter, softs the balustrade
      Of ice, and lacking you the summer is
      A lock without your key
      A hidden sun.
      And here follows a poem about art:
      To witness the mutation of a fruit
      (The word our editor's, the need our own),
      The ripeness on the round, he plants a pip,
      Lies down until he can sleep in the shade,
      Starves till the fruit bubbles on the green.
