      ([unclear]OEUFS[/unclear] DE PA QUES)

      Encased at first in silver
      Then ready for the lips
      Its anal charm provokes
      Our fatal appetite

      Not given by the swan
      (white question of the lakes)
      Nor by the [unclear]jeweled[/unclear] peacock
      That perfect brunette oval we ate

      vii

      Wednesday

      ... And row there poems, light as they are, turn into prose. It is
      Wednesday again and I miss you as agonisingly as ever. I have 'got
      [unclear]down[/unclear]' to a great deal of gallery goings (8 times to the Vienna pictures) and
      for the rest of the week I have the Louvre, the Jeu de Paume, on schedule.
      No time for writing, taking in so much. All of which however does not
      in the least distract my libido from you. Architecture must come
      next week. I have got a few books - including Valery's [unclear]Callede[/unclear]
      poems. Michael will be interested in this.

      Have you made a decision about Paris yet? It is difficult
      to write without your letters here and I'm beginning to worry about how long
      the mail takes back and forth as I asked at cooks yesterday
      without any luck. Actually it is now fixed and we are staying at
      the Hotel de I'Avenir indefinitely. You could write me direct. I
      expect to return in about 2 weeks from now - roughly - that is
      before the final lecture. I wish I could come before but I realise
      that I must not if my money holds out.

      Albert is rather unhappy at present - it is the anniversary
      [unclear]willies[/unclear] [unclear]the[/unclear] days of when his wife left him. It manifests itself in
      an inability to paint and to sexual [unclear]urges[/unclear] that my celibate position
      has not assisted. He has met a Swedish girl, a night that dances,
      but things are rogue and harmless so far. He has talked - for the
      first time about his past and really he's the Sartre - Milles
      underground man - violent, hunted, [unclear]etc.[/unclear]

      urgethat my celibate position has not assited. He has met a Swedish girl, a
      night club dancer, but things are vague and formless so far. He has  talked
      - for the first time about the past and really he's the Satre-Mills underground
      man - violent, hunted etc.

    annotation_text: vi. (OEUFS DE PA QUES)  Encased at first in silver Then ready
      for the lips Its oval charm provokes Our fatal appetite.  Not given by the swan
      (white question of the lake) Nor by the jeweled peacock That perfect brunette
      oval we ate  vii.  Wednesday   ......And now there poems, light as they are,
      turn into prose.  It is Wednesday again and I miss you as agonizingly as ever.  I
      have "got down" to a great deal of gallery paintings (8 times to the Vienna
      pictures) and for the rest of the week I have the Louvre, the Jeu de Paume,
      on schedule.  No time for writing, taking in so much.  All of which however
      does not in the least distract my libido from you.  Architecture must come next
      week.  I have got a few books including Valery's [unclear][/unclear] poems.  Michael
      will be interested in this.  Have you made a decision about Paris yet?  It is
      difficult to write without your letters here and I'm beginning to worry about
      how long the mail takes back and forth as I asked at Cooks yesterday without
      any luck.  Actually it is now fixed and we are staying at the Hotel de l'Arenis
      indefinitely.  You could write me direct.  I expect to return in about 2 weeks
      from now - roughly - that is before the final lecture.  I wish I could come
      before but I realise that I must not if my money holds out.  Albert is rather
      unhappy at present.  It is the anniversary [unclear][/unclear] two days of when
      his wife left him.  It manifests itself in an inability to paint and a sexual
      [unclear][/unclear] that my celibate position has not assisted.  He has met
      a Swedish girl, a night club dancer, but things are vague and formless so far.  He
      has talked for the first time about his past and really he's the Sartre-Miller
      underground man - violent, hunted, &c.
