      4 me excellent - I want to hear them again when I come - and I also look forward to reading about "Doll-phobia"!
      I adore your picture of Dandylion contemplating "the Long Engagement". What fun! Poor Dandy I do ease!
      I was happy to read your articles in Art News - it reads well. I was glad that they wrote up Heffers - it will help Michael - thought it wasn't a very intelligent article - what credit is there in listing the already famous with only the most banal of comments? and with the superior air of one who has discovered something or performed with more than usual dexterity a conjouring trick. How I dislike these parvenu lords of criticism. I much preferred Chase's article which reveals his unpretentiousness and rather touching earnestness - he tries very hard to be just! and I think he writes quite weel.

      me excellent. I want to hear them
      again when I come, and I also
      look forward to reading about "Doll-
      Phobia"!
      I adore your picture of Dandylion
      contemplating "the Long Engagement." What
      fun! Poor Dandy I do tease!
      I was happy to read your article
      in [unclear]the[/unclear] news. It reads very well.
      I was glad that they wrote up [unclear]Weffers[/unclear],
      it will help Michael, though it wasn't
      a very intelligent article. What credit
      is there in listing the already famous
      with only the most banal of comments?
      and with the superior air of one who
      has discovered something or performed
      with more than usual dexterity a
      conjuring trick. How I dislike these
      [unclear]pasvenn[/unclear] lords of criticism! I much
      prefered chase's article which reveals
      his unpretentiousness and rather [unclear]tonely[/unclear]
      earnestness, he tries very hard to be
      just .1 and I think he writes quite well.
      I looked and looked at the Academ
      -ic Ingres-like drawing of M. Evans
