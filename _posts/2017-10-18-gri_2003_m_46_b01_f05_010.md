    annotation_text: "Your reflections on absence are very\nlogical but I hope that
      this time, on the \n18th, it won't be difficult for you. As \nyou know I swoon
      with pleasure at the mere\nsight of you. What I think I shall try \nand do is
      send an encouraging poem to you\non the 17th. I am so happy the you en-\njoyed
      my last poems. As soon as I had read your\nletter this morning I wrote the poem
      which \naccompanies this letter; inspiration is\nthus simply, exactly, equated
      with you.\nI adore your letters and have re-read many \nrecently but think that
      some of your last letters are the most expressive, the\nmost precious. But to
      go back to the theme\nI started this paragraph with: much as I \nmiss you (see
      so many of my letters in the\npast) I have acheived a compromise by con-\nsidering
      your letters part of you. Not the \nfullest part, but important, covetable,\nstimulation,
      full of echoes and shadows of \nyour self. Since some kind of arrangement\nhad
