      THIS CHRISTMAS AND NEXT YEAR
      to SYLVIA

      Mistletoe shadows
      On your face send
      lions to their doom.
      Ah! soft [unclear]cage[/unclear]
      I

      The book of the year is open.

      The course of the wintered year
      Ends on the seasonal page.

      Bemused summer is words;
      Spring is in there, somewhere:
      Autumn is tired, having come early.

      Without reading I remember
      This year as episodes of you,
      Without or with, May or September.

      What I hope for the next page
      Is a book of, only, you.

      O the January of it, open.

      The house is the head
      of a lion.
      It is warm.
      It is thoughtful.
