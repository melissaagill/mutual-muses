      Pay blossom makes this April gay
      Flints in a field glint and sparkle
      And the beams of early sunlight fall
      Like fronds of hair from a woman's head combed

      There. I am still tinkering with the sonnets so no more in this letter

      I hope you are not doing any work again yet, anything really serious I mean. but I hope that soon you will feel alright to adapt those clothes you mentioned and use those feathers. When you have done this and I see you wearing them I think I shall have to write some Mallarmesque compliments - delighted and intricate. And what about the material you have with Clifford's blessing? How pleasant to go to church in it. Though I fear the very stones will groan at the pagan sophistication of the material's new appearance. Do tell me when you start and what you do. You will look ravishing in the new look, Sylvia.

      It is exactly eleven o'clock. I love you.

      I have not yet found any book of Titian although I have looked in several libraries. But really I shall leave no shelf unturned.

      Johnson wnet to the Albertina drawings yesterday with the Poisers (spelling?) but - see above - I prefer red Chelsen in the afternoon. However I am having tea with him tomorrow and he tells me it wasn't sunstroke but a kind of influenzxa and the doctor doesnt' really know what it was. (Could it have [unclear]see[/unclear]psychological?)

      Oh, this is delightful. Another clock has just struck eleven. Still I am thinking of you. I love you.

      I ache this morning because I played various running about games with Myranda, Marien, and Lynda yesterday, three cousins whose combined age is about twenty-three. Please don't be patronising about it.

      Today I think I shall eat all my sweet ration because I think there is going to be a war soon.
      I love you. All my love.
