      The Aubreys 3rd April 1949

      Dearest Sylvia

      Your letters have been a consolation for your absence. I am glad you have been able to write so regularly, my sweetheart. My heart gave, then, a little movement, beating faster than usual, when I thought that I shall see you soon again. Ah, my dearest - I love you so much, much more, I confess, than is expedient or discreet. I love you.

      I am impatient ot see your new paintings. What pleasure it gives me that you are working!

      By the way, I suppose you, too, have received the final certificate from the Univ. of London? It, like so many other
