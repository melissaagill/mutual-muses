      Changing the mood abruptly I must give you a few pieces of news; first, I am going to see some Hogarths in the basement of the N.G. (thanks to Charles) - part of the British Council's Scandinavian show. 2 Time & Tide have rejected my poems. 3 I shall see Sir Orbert in mid-October (he goes to Italy in a day or two): his letter was charming - but waiting is a bore. I am perfectly confident of writing and working well but I am so irritated by the slowness of every design _ still no word from Dilys Powell.
      That is my news over and done with - so let me return to my favorite subject and send you, as far as I can by letter, my love. I send you as many kisses as hairs in my mane and long to hug you with all four paws.
      Sylvia, my rose, my beauty, I love you

      Changing the mood abruptly, I must give you a few pieces of news, - first, I am going to see some Hogarths in the basement of the N.G. (thanks to Charles) - part of the British Council's Scandinavian Show, 2 Time & Tide have rejected my poems, 3 I shall see Sir Osbert in mid-October (he goes to Italy in a day or two): his letter was charming but waiting is a bore. I am perfectly confident of writing & working well but I am so [unclear]vivitated[/unclear] by the slowness of every design - still no word from Dilys Powell.

      That is my news over and done with - so let me return to my favourite subject and send you, as far as I can by letter, my love. I send you as many kisses as hairs in my mane and I long to hug you with all four paws.
      Sylvia, my rose, my beauty, I love you
      Lawrence
