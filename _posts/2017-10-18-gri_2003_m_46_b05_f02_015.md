      Monday
      Dearest Sylvia
      Thank you for your letter.  I am delighted
      you have painted the pineapple already:  each
      named fruit is a succulent milestone saying
      fewer hours to Blackheath.
      My last two lectures went very nicely and I
      enjoyed private hospitality, instead of hotels.
      Your divine and constable pusso arrival with
      is Garland before the last lecture, so anx-
      ious was he not to be late--so I lectured
      in it.  The purro worked the lantern.  He was
      timid at first but masterly by the middle.
      I do hope you are not so worried, my darling.  I
      love you very much, my precious beauty, my
      muse, my delight.  (Perhpas Tiny is nice
      now--at any rate I hope so.)
      I have been getting various lectures ready today
      and am soon to meet Paul (Harding) for the even-
      ing.  Tomorrow I am taking part in something called
      algad by inoge--a discussion I gather--at the
      ICA Richard Lanroy has arranged it.
      When are you coming?  Do you grow yet?
      I long to see you.  I will meet you whenever
      and wherever you say.
      I love you
      Lawrence.
      P.S.  Father is coming to the TG on Saturday--not Miss Long.  L

      Monday

      Dearest Sylvia,
      thank you for your letter. I am delighted
      you have painted the pine-apple already: each
      named fruit is a succulent milestone saying
      fewer hours to Blackheath.
      My last two lectures went very nicely & I
      enjoyed private hospitality, instead of hotels.
      Your divine and covetable pusso arrived with
      his garland before the last lecture - so anx-
      ious was he not to be late - so I lectured
      in it. The pusso worked the lantern - he was
      timid at first but masterly by the middle.
      I do hope you are not worried, my darling. I
      love you very much, my precious beauty, my
      muse - my delight. (Perhaps Tiny is nicer
      now - at any rate I hope so.)
      I have been getting various lectures ready today
      and am soon to meet Paine (Harding) for the even-
      ing. Tomorrow I am taking part in something called
      [unclear]Alyad[/unclear] & Image - a discussion in gallery - at the
      I. C. A. Richard Lanvay has arranged it.
      When are you coming? Do you know yet?
      I long to see you. I will meet you whenever
      and wherever you say.
      I love you
      Lawrence

      P.S.Father is coming to the T. G. on Saturday - bit Miss [unclear]Lacey[/unclear]! L
