      very glad to see it.  I should like
      Clifford to see some of your latests work.
      I am so glad that you are
      so full of ideas for the fun book,
      and very interested in the Ballebrie,
      or Masque typo and the "Pedestrian"
      musical!  Freet doesn't sound very
      flattering!
      It's now pouring with rain so
      I shall paint in the studio.  I
      have dashened the wall of the picture
      of you in the garden with lupins and think
      I have solved it!  I am thinking
      of doing a small still-life with pansies
      they are so pretty.  The rain has since
      found to hail like small moth balls--I'm
      most indignant.
      You will have letters waiting for
      you at Blackheath.
      I love you, dearest Poet, I
      love you.
      Sylvia

      very glad to see it.  I should like
      Clifford to see some of your latest work.
          I am so glad that  you are
      so full of ideas for the film book --
      and very interested in the [unclear]Balletie[/unclear]
      or Masque type and the "Pedestrian"
      musical!  That doesn't sound very
      flattering!
         Its now pouring with rain so
      I shall paint in the studio.  I
      have darkened the wall of the picture
      of you in the garden with lupins and think
      I have solved it!  I am thinking
      of doing a small still-life with pansies
      they are so pretty.  The rain has since
      turned to hail like small moth balls -- I'm
      most indignant --
         You will have letters waiting for
      you at Blackheath,
          I love you, dearest Poet, I
      love you
              Sylvia.
