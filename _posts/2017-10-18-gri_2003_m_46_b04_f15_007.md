      nearly blown away glass and all!

      I haven't done very much at present, yesterday I felt so tired - I'm better today, all is well and fairly cheerful. I asked Clifford about the names - he is going to look them out.

      I will enquire about parcels and put it on the bus. Let me know when it would suit you best. What about Saturday arrive at about 12.43?

      I hope to cut out my suit today, I have bought cotton for it. I have got "Kissing" out ready to do - will you tell me the size?

      Clifford is anxious to have his books as soon as possible.

      Have you found out about Othello's copyright?

      I adore you - dearest one my beautiful Lion, my poet,
      I love you
      Sylvia

      nearly blown away glass and all!

      I haven't done very much at present yesterday I felt so tired - I'm better today, all is well and fairly cheerful.  I asked Clifford about the names - he is going to look them out.

      I will enquire about parcels and put it on the bus.  Let me know when it would suit you best.  What about Saturday arrive at about 12:43?

      I hope to cut out my suit today.  I have bought cotton for it.  I have get "Kissing" out [unclear]ready[/unclear] to do - with you to tell me the size.

      Clifford is anxious to have his books as soon as possible.  Have you found out about [unclear]Ethel's[/unclear] copyright?

      I adore you - dearest one by beautiful Lion, my poet, I love you
      Sylvia
