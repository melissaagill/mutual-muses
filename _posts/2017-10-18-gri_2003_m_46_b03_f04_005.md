      At present, says Metty, the yellow pansy is in the best condition. They require a lot of attention, she says.

      Perhaps Clifford's lecture stopped you feeling<br/>too dreary . . . <br/>It
      is 10:30 and I think I must wrap up the Mermaid<br/>and Raven and see about
      taking them to town.<br/>I enclose the library tickets which have caused<br/>you
      so much concern. Thank you for allowing me<br/>to use them when I had no tickets
      of my own. I apol-<br/>ogize if I have abused your kindness by keeping<br/>books
      overdue on them.<br/>I love you<br/>Lawrence

      Yesterday, before going to dinner, I re- visited Chiswick House.  You will be pleased to hear that restoration is proceeding conscientiously - and is even extended to the [unclear]wins[/unclear].  The obelisk has had a new coat of paint - very smart.
      Paul has given me more raw materials so I should now be able to write several books with needing [unclear]arg[/unclear] materials.  Even two- colored type-writer ribbons which, for different reasons, both Hetty & Iawalla enjoy.
      At present, says Hetty, the yellow pansy is in the best condition. They do require a lot of attention, she says.
      You do not sound very cheerful in your letter.  I am glad, however, ou are better, that's a good thing.  Perhaps Clifford's lecture stopped you feeling too dreary....
      It is 10.30 and I think I must wrap up the mermaid and raven and see about taking then to town.
      I enclose the library tickets which have caused you so much concern.  Thank you for allowing me to use them when I had no tickets of my own.  I apologise if I have abused your kindness by keeping books overdue on them.
      I love you
