      my values were 'anti-values' and by Robert saying I have 'an erotic interest in inferior objects' (movie, bad reproductions, &c.).
      Sylvester was to have opened the Henry Moore ICA discussion tomorrow but has become temperamental & will be late: so I've agreed to open it (which means some extra work).
      I am expected to criticise Moore. (That shouldn't be difficult.)
      This evening I am dining with Pasmore. I shall post this letter, on the way.
      I am looking forward so much to Wales. It will be wonderful. I love you, I love you.
      I adore you
