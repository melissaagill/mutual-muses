      Wednesday

      Dearest Sylvia,

        I have your darling letter beside me now and I need not tell you how much I look forward to receiving a dark pink rose.   Like the Cavalier poet I shall know where Jove bestows the rose when June is over.   I am excited to hear, too, that you hope to start the sketch for our double portrait.   I cannot honestly share yours and Michael's pleasure about the rain since I want to sunbathe:  already I have lost what color I had.   And since I may miss the strawberries I have no interest in the fertility of peas and beans.   Ugh;  my rococo typewriter gave a tiny shudder, imperceptible to other fingers perhaps, as I put down the names of those vegetables.   Yes, my dearest, the 18th is wonderful, and I shall come early of course.   Thank you so much;  and do thank Michael too.

         I hugely enjoyed your description of eleven o'clock on Sunday:  Job, me, and your own delicious irreverence.   I am glad too that your visionary dandylion was counter to Blake's images also.

      share yours and Michael's pleasure about the rain since I want to sunbathe:
      already I have lost what color I had. And since I may miss the strawberries
      I have no interest in the fertility of peas and beans. Ugh; my rococo typewriter
      gave a tiny shudder, imperceptible to other fingers perhaps, as I put down the
      name of those vegetables. Yes, my dearest, the 18th is wonderful, and I shall
      come early, of course. Thank you so much; and do thank Michael too.\n\nI hugely
      enjoyed your description of eleven o'clock on Sunday: Job, me, and your own
      delicious irreverence. I am glad too that your visionary dandylion was counter
      to Blake's images also. "

      Sylvia,<br/>I have your darling letter beside me now and I need not tell you
      how much I look forward to receiving a dark pink rose. Like the Cavalier poet
      I shall know where Jove bestows the rose when June is over. I am excited to
      hear, too, that you hope to start the sketch for our double portrait. I cannot
      honestly share yours and Michael''s pleasure about the rain since I want to
      sunbathe: already I have lost what color I had. And since I may miss the strawberries
      I have no interest in the fertility of peas and beans. Ugh; my rococo typewriter
      gave a tiny shudder, imperceptible to other fingers perhaps, as I put down the
      name of those vegetables. Yes, my dearest, the 18th is wonderful, and I shall
      come early, of course. Thank you so much; and do thank Michael too.<br/><br/>I
      hugely enjoyed your description of eleven o''clock on Sunday: Job, me, and your
