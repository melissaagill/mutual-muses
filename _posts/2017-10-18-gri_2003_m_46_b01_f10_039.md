      the future is a vase that time will turn
      to show the matching picture, the design
      continued round the camber of the urn,
      the abstract pattern or hand-painted vine.
      this trail of roses leads beyond our sight
      but we need fear no autumn and no break:
      the lovers on the swing are answered quite
      by their doubles lounging by a lake.
      or dancing figures dancing in a ring
      around a classic urn delight the mind with flawless continuity but bring
      more to the eyes than eyes at first can bind.
      the future is a vase that we shall turn
      to find and flowers and dances going on.
