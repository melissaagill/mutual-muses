      3.
      I shall be interested in your opinion of [unclear] Lam[/unclear]- from photographs years ago in Horizon I didn't feel very enthusiastic but I expect he has developed and so have I! Also his organisation of colours may be very interesting- I only remember some bambo wallpaper effects- or am I thinking of someone else?

      I slept well last night, thank you, but very little the night before. I am better now though I feel tired and fragile!

      I shall read "The N of the N" but I must read Ulysses first! at present I'm struggling with Savage! It's very good but his attitudes are not mine.

      I am very glad to hear of the good and expensive restaurant. I hope that you are well, dearest one. Your letter seems a happy and confident one which cheers me for I know one can do so much more if one is in that mood.

      I shall give this to Clifford to post in case you have time to waste be-[unclear][/unclear]
