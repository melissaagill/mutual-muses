      been trying to clean up the Studio it is better now It has been too cloudy to do the beach scenes, we went down [unclear]bathing[/unclear] this morning and I hoped it would clear but it was no good - I think I shall do some R and A this afternoon.
      I think perhaps I had better go to Ditchling on the 15th but let me know how you feel - then I would come to town on Saturday.
      In haste to catch the post
      I love you
