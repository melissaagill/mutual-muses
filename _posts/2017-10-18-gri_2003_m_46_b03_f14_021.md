      5. I adore the Prince. What a pity it was so savaged by Queen Victoria. I like nothing about her.
      I have no other news. I love you dearest. Your ever present golden image spins me on to efforts of painting and I feel quite guilty if I am doing anything else! I hope to do a painting of Michael and Clifford on the beach if the weather permits but it seems most uncertain. I love you my darling Apollo--my beauty--sweet one. I love you. Sylvia
