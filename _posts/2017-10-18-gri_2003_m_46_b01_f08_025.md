      Sylvia,\n\nThank you so much for your nice fat letter. It was both thoughtful
      and gay and I was glad for both halves. Glad for the description of you and
      Michael at present because it does help me. Glad for the charming Minervan passages
      because it is time we were cheerful again.\n\nYour White Owl arrived this morning
      quite early and gave me news of you. When we heard the post come he winked at
      me and said: 'There's one for you. No. Stay there - I'll get it'. The Tawny
      Owl patronises him a little but is genuinely fond of him. I have, however, warned
      the White One against certain traps for Owls in the West End of London where
      it is not safe for him to venture. He said that he would be safe because you
      would appear in a cloud if he was in danger and carry him off as you did for
      many Greek heroes. But I persuaded him it was unfair to disturb you as you were
      busy painting and 'with a wisdom beyond his years' he agreed. Still, I'm glad
      the Tawny One will keep an eye on him. Thank you, Minerva, for him: I shall
      sacrifice a kiss morning and night on your altar (it is in the rose-corner of
      my room). Yesterday the three of us visited the exhibition of Picasso lithographs
      and were especially struck by five owl pictures (you will just be in time to
      see them when you come to town.). The Tawny Owl says it is a speaking likeness
      of an owl he knew during the war (he was in the Free France Owls) named Pierre
      Hibou. The White Owl wants his portrait done now. I have told him that only
      you can do him.\n\nI am so happy about the reflection. The fact it is solid,
      like Michael's portrait and my fauve one, shows surely that your drawing advances
      in the way you desire. \n\nMy address in Bath is: c/o Mrs Lyttle, 64 St. John's
      Road, Bathwick, Bath, Somerset. (Bathwick is essential.) I shall be there from
      the 18th to about the 23rd. I hope you will write to me there for be sure I
      shall write to you. Both owls are looking forward to the trip. I have sent the
      White Owl out in my duffle coat to see if he can 'pick up' a good book on Bath
      for me. The Tawny Owl had scruples about this but I managed to bring him around
      to my way of thinking but I notice that he jumps at every knock or ring on the
      door."

      16th September 1948

      Dearest Sylvia,

      Thank you so much for your nice fat letter. It was both thoughtful and gay and I was glad for both halves. Glad for the description of you and Michael at present because it does help me. Glad for the charming Minervan passages because it is time we were cheerful again.

      Your White Owl arrived this morning quite early and gave me news of you. When we heard the pot come he winked at me and said: 'There's one for you. No. Stay there -I'll get it'. The Tawny Owl patronises him a little but is genuinely fond of him. I have, however, warned the White One against certain traps for Owls in the West End of London where it is not safe for him to venture. He said that he would be safe because you would appear in a cloud if he was in danger and carry him off as you did for many Greek heroes. But I persuaded him it was unfair to disturb you as you were busy painting and 'with a wisdom beyond his years; he agreed. Still I'm glad the Tawny One will keep an eye on him. Thank you, Minerva, for him: I shall sacrifice a kiss morning and night on your altar (it is in the rose-corner of my room). Yesterday the three of us visited the exhibition of Picasso lithographs and were especially struck by five owl pictures (you will be just in time to see them when you come to town).

I have told him that only you can do him.

      I am so happy about the reflection. The fact it is solid, like Michael's portrait and my fauve one, shows surely that your drawing advances in the way you desire.

      My address in Bath is: c/6 Mrs Lyttle, 64 St. John's Road, Bathwick, Bath, Somerset. (Bathwick is essential.) I shall be there from the 18th to about the 23rd. I hope you will write to me there for be sure I shall write to you. Both owls are looking forward to the trip.

      Wimbledon

      16th September 1948

      Dearest Sylvia,

      Thank you so much for your nice fat letter.  It was both thoughtful and gay and I was glad for both halves.  Glad for the description of you and Michael at present because it does help me.  Glad for the charming Minervan passages because it is time we were cheerful again.

      Your White Owl arrived this morning quite early and gave me news of you.  When we heard the post come he winked at me and said:  'There's one for you.  No.  Stay there - I'll get it'.   The Tawney Owl patronises him a little but is genuinely fond of him.  I have, however, warned the White One against certain traps for Owls in the West End of London where it is not safe for him to venture.  He said that he would be safe because you would appear in a cloud if he was in danger and carry him off as you did for many Greek heroes.  But I persuaded him it was unfair to disturb you as you were busy painting and 'with a wisdom beyond his years' he agreed.  Still, I'm glad the Tawny One will keep an eye on him.  Thank you, Minerva, for him:  I shall sacrifice a kiss morning and night on your altar (it is in the rose-corner of my room).  Yesterday the three of us visited the exhibition of Picasso lithographs and were especially struck by five owl pictures (you will just be in time to see them when you come to town.).  The Tawny Owl says it is a speaking likeness of an owl he knew during the war (he was in the Free Frence Owls) named Pierre Hibou.  The White Owl wants his portrait done now.  I have told him that only you can do him.

      I am so happy about the reflection.  The fact it is solid, like Michael's portrait and my fauve one, shows surely that your drawing advances in the way you desire.

      My address in Bath is: c/o Mrs Lyttle, 64 St. John's Road, Bathwick, Bath, Somerset.  (Bathwick is essential.)  I shall be there from the 18th to about the 23rd.  I hope you will write to me there for be sure I shall write to you.  Both owls are looking forward to the trip.  I have sent the White Owl out in my duffle coat to see if he can 'pick up' a good book on Bath for me.  The Tawny Owl had scruples about this but I managed to bring him round to my way of thinking but I notice that he jumps at every knock or ring on the door.
