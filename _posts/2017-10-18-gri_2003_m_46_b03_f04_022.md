      Catt.  She is also bothered by a former lover who followed her about in a sinister
      fashion when Bernard and I were with her.  She  has lived, and seems to be living,
      and I quote '200%'.  We met also a lot of other people of various races and
      most of them painters.  I enjoyed numerous arguments and discussions.  (I am
      glad to be staying at home today for it was a long day and I was rather tired.)
      Oh, and yes, we did see [unclear]the[/unclear] Pavilion.  I thought of you so often, my dearest.

      Your new picture is clearly a portrait of John 'Raphael' Smith of [unclear]Marland[/unclear],
      (D. Marland, of course).  M seems to have paid anything from £15 to 1 for it, so
      ambiguous is your hieroglyph for the sum!  I am glad M has a commission
      already.  Do, of course, congratulate him.  Your name is not in yesterday's
      Observer, I'm afraid.

      I do hope you are well again and that you are seeing Bath in detail (even,
      perhaps, doing some drawing).  Have you met my parents yet, I wonder ...
      I want you, if you will, to do an illustration for my Bath room - illustrat-
      ing the capriccio section.  I think that would be an amusing subject.  Do
      you?

      I love you so much.  Your letters make me very happy, my beauty.
      You are in my imagination all the while, in mythological and contemporary
      shapes.  Your lion is facing, as he writes, the picture of [unclear]Hetty[/unclear].  She is out
      hoping to buy some [unclear]extrarogent[/unclear] [unclear]glare[/unclear] - glasses, picture - hats, and straw
      shoes.  She sends her love.
      Sylvia my beauty I love you

      She has lived, and seems to be living, and I quote, '200%'. We met also a lot
      of other people of various races and most of them painters. I enjoyed numerous
      arguments & discussions. (I am glad to be staying at home today for it was a
      long day & I was rather tired). Oh, and, yes, we did see the Pavilion. I thought
      of you so often, my dearest. Your new picture is clearly a portrait of John
      'Raphael' Smith & Morland, (D. Morland, of course). M seems to have paid anything
      from (pound sign) 51 to 1 for it, so ambiguous is your hieroglyph for the sum!
      I am glad M has a commission already. Do, of course, congratulate him. Your
      name is not in yesterday's Observer, I'm afraid. I do hope you are well again
      and that you are seeing Bath in detail (even, perhaps, doing some drawing).
      Have you met my parents yet, I wonder...I want you, if you will, to do an illustration
      for my Bath poem-illustrating the capriccio section. I think that would be an
      amusing subject. Do you? I love you so much. Your letters make me very happy,
      my beauty. You are in my imagination all the while, in mythological and contemporary
      shapes. Your lion is facing, as he writes, the picture of Hetty. She is out
      hoping to buy some extravagant glare-glasses, picture-hats, & straw shoes. She
