      [19-9-49]
      Blackheath
      Monday

      Dearest Sylvia,

      Thank you for coming here for my birthday - it was very
      pleasant.  Following your visit I have written some poems:

      Of the double iconology
      Which version is my visitor?
      Chronos, plucking hairs and sowing
      Forebodings of the rotting future,
      Games of absence, overpowering choice,
      Old beard and bones, the dog of clocks?
      Or the naked agile boy,
      Hair flopping on his forehead
      For virile hands to catch and render
      Wishes into form and action?

      Because my love has caught his lock
      The former version stayed away
      On my anniversary.
      For as long as she stays here
      Opportunity is ours
      And abundant satisfactions:
      But when she leaves me both are haunted
      By Renaissance, not classic, Time.
      The fear of time is her companion
      And I must search for the illusive boy.

      And another one, the one I promised you yesterday, which
      I felt you inspiring while we were together:

      In old cosmogonies the place of water
      Is low upon the scale, weighted
      By elemental cold and heaviness,
      Is alien, it seems, to lovers' use
      Composed, as they are, of the air and light.

      Blackheath Monday
      Dearest Sylvia,
      Thank you for coming here for my birthday - it was very pleasant. Following your visit I have written some poems:

      Of the double iconology
      Which version is my visitor?
      Chronos, plucking hairs and sowing
      Forebodings of the rotting future,
      Games of asbence, overpowering  choice,
      Old beard and bones, the dog of clocks?
      Or the naked agile boy,
      Hair flopping on his forehead
      For virile hands to catch and render
      Wishes into form and action?

      Because my love has caught his lock
      The former version stayed away
      On my anniversary.
      For as long as she stays here
      Opportunity is ours
      And abundant satisfactions:
      But when she leaves me both are haunted
      By Renaissance, not classic, Time.
      The fear of time is her companion
      And I mist search for the illusive boy.

      And another one, the one I promised you yesterday, which I felt you inspiring while we were together:

      In old cosmogonies the place of water
      Is low upon the scale, weighted
      By elemental cold and heaviness,
      Is alien, it seems, to lovers' use
      Composed, as they are, of the air and light.
