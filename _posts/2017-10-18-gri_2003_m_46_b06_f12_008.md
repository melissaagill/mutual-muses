      PAINTING
      It is difficult to characterise a year's painting with
      much certainty. Easel painting is, by its very nature, in-
      dividualistic and experimental - the product of the artist
      in his studio, free of the dicates of patronage. To impose
      a fixed form on the most changeable of art forms is no easy
      talk. One must even take into account the time-lag between
      the canvas, wet on the artist's easel, and the same work hang-
      ing, framed, in a gallery. However, provisional contours may
      be indicated.
      The popularity of not-figurative art (closely called abstract
      art) was undiminished in 1953. Abstract art is truly cosmo-
      politan in the way that Gothic and Mannerism were international.
      Italy, Scandinavia, France, Britain, despite local differences,
      had much in common: Serge Poliakov and William Scott, Hans Har-
      tung, and Giuseppe Santomaso, for example, link Paris and London,
      Paris and Venice by their stylistic affinities. Abstract art
      has many more degrees, many shades of formal meaning: during the year
      Nicholas de Stael's sensual painterliness and Max Bill's linear
      exactitude were both influential (the former more so).
      Probably the most significant phase of post war abstract art
      was the revival and extension of Abstact Expresaionism, a move-
      ment with strong American allegiances. In France a group was
      sponsored by Michel Tapie - whose book Un Art Autre circulated in
      1953. In spirit the group was vehement, dark, expressionistic.

      PAINTING

      It is difficult to characterise a year's painting with much certainty. Basel painting is, by its very nature  individualistic and experimental - the product of the artist in his studio, free of the dictates of patronage. To impose a fixed form on the most changeable of art forms is no easy task. One must even take into account the time-lag between the canvas, wet on the artist's easel, and the same work hanging, framed, in a gallery. However, provisional contours may be indicated.

      The popularity of non-figurative art (loosely called abstract art) was undiminished in 1953. Abstract art is truly cosmopolitan in the way that Gothic and Mannerism were international. Italy, Scandinavia, France, Britain, despite local differences had much in common: Serge Poliakov and William Scott, Hans Harstung and Giuseppe Santomaso, for example, link Paris and London, Paris and Venice by their stylistic affinities. Abstract art has many degrees, many shades of formal meaning: during the year Nicholas de Stael's sensual painterliness and Max Bill's linear exactitude were both influential (the former more so).

      Probably the most significant art was the revival and extension of Abstract Expressionism, a movement with strong American allegiances. In France a group was sponsored by Michel Tapie - whose book Un Art Autre circulated in 1953. In spirit the group was vehement, dark, expressionistic. Their art was intended less as a style than as a series of ges-
