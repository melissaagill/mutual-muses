           SMELL

      Perfume eludes the morbid fingers
      And half the day the night-scent lingers;:
      Like the Augustan lap-dog
      Or classic bird we are intent
      On sensuous equivalents
      That answer questions other sense beg:
      Lovers who inhale the shuttered perfume
      Are haunted, shadowed by the voiceless plume.

           TASTE

      In terms of feasting on the grass
      Of a valley strewn with terms
      I place the lovers with their mouths
      Among the ripened pears and plums,
      Wines made in their native south,
      And, timeless, wheels of cheese:
      Among the orchards and the plates
      Food is fore-pleasure, and the bait.

          ENVOY

      Clouds shaped like perfume overheard,
      Poets with a taste for colour-adjectives,
      Roses like a woman to the touch,
      The squared senses of lovers are so full.

      II

      SMELL

      Perfume eludes the morbid fingers
      And half the day the night-scent lingers:
      Like the Augustan lap-dog
      Or classic bird we are intent
      On sensuous equivalents
      That answer questions other senses beg:
      Lovers who inhale the shuttered perfume
      Are haunted, shadowed by the voiceless plume.

      TASTE

      In terms of feasting on the grass
      Of a valley strewn with terms
      I place the lovers with their mouths
      Among the ripened pears and plums,
      Wines made in their native south,
      And, timeless, wheels of cheese:
      Among the orchards and the plates
      Food is fore-pleasure, and the bait.

      ENVOY

      Clouds shape like perfume overheard,
      Poets with a taste for color-adjectives,
      Roses like a woman to the touch,
      The squared senses of lovers are so full.
