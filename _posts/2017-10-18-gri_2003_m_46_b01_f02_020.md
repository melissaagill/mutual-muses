      all three as I can''t set a farm of free admission at the  museums until Saturday.
      One delight for me was a group of 6 tapestries from Alebois de Fontainellean
      with Bronzino, Giulio Romano, Michelangelo, &c &c erbaes and a calos schemeof
      esquisite retrait jumping occasionally into magenta on royal blue. Very fine
      too were companion pais by detolorges, an entombment and resurrection of Christ
      bath in the same landscape. The Rubens. mostly, disappoint after the NG''s example,
      Clo'' they are magnificant they are dirty. But only 2 Brugels, and there small
      ones. An amazing feature of such a show. Alas. <br/>ran will be good to know
      Albert is a good  coalz. However I do miss your caba made with sous mille.<br/>How
      are you? By means of your locket and the treasures of my memory I invabe you
      all the time. I think how you would dislike the furniture of this room. How
      you would enjoy the galleries. How you would like the quays, the sun the buds.
      But equally, as well as placing you in my own situations, I wonder what you
      are doing. I except you are in the garden a lot.<br/>This roughl is one view'
