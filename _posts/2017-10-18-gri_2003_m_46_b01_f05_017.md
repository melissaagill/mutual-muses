      Waugh isn't concerned in the least with a supernat-
      ural father figure (quite the reserve - think of the sym-
      bolic title) and he is concerned with death - as are the
      Roman Catholic characters in his story. (You implied they
      were not and I must admit I did not follow that quite.)
      'Sin' and its victory over 'Sin'-in several people in whom one mighthave expected the reverse. The fact I
      consider the former an illusion and the latter desire-
      a deep aspect of the R.C. heritage. Like it or not.
      I wasn't concerned with its [unclear]?????????[/unclear] value in any but the Catholic scale of things. Technically Brideshead
      is a triumph.

      I have been struggling with existentialsim this last
      day or two and though making some progress a lot of what
      I have dimly apprehended seems to be furious running to
      keep in exactly the same place. Sometimes a banal
      place. This is literal criticism.

      I have a Flugel's Population, Psychology, and Peace,
      Have you read it? I expect you have. I'm looking for-
      ward to it with interest.

      [unclear]O[/unclear], that's enough chatter. All I really want is to
      say that I adore you and can never tell you how much I
      feel about you. Metaphors of height and depth, of
      tenderness and fierceness, color and shape, abstraction
      and detail, all fall short of the truth. The rose is
      one theme but there is more. Your double portrait will
      perhaps express it, this feeling so difficult to analyse.
      Neither sensual nor intellectual, but a sort of simple
      satisfaction in your presence and I long for the 18th.

      All my love, Sylvia.
      lawrence
      [unclear]I hear there is a neran slow of Lawrence which I
      look forward in seeing. I can keep every so
      longer! And, or see redfem, David Imos, half

      Waugh isn't concerned in the least with a supernatural father figure (quite the reverse - think of the symbolic title) and he is concerned with death - as are the Roman Catholic characters in his story.  (You implied they were not and I must admit I did not follow that quite.) His concern is with the continuation of Grace despite 'Sin' and its victory over 'Sin' - in several people in whom one might have expected the reverse.  The fact I consider the former an illusion and the latter desirable doesn't blind me to the fact that Waugh has traced a deep aspect of the R.C. heritage.  Like it or not.  I wasn't concerned with its value in any but the Catholic scale of things.  Technically Brideshead is a triumph.

      I have been struggling with existentialism this last day or two and though making some progress a lot of what I have dimly apprehended seems to be furious running to keep in exactly the same place.  Sometimes a banal place. This is leteral criticism.

      I have to get Flugel's Population, Psychology, and Peace, Have you read it?  I expect you have. I'm looking forward to it with interest.

      C, that's enough chatter.  All I really want is to say that I adore you and can never tell you how much I feel about you.  Metaphors of height and depth, of tenderness and fierceness, color and shape, abstraction and detail, all fall short of the truth.  The rose is one theme but there is more.  Your double portrait will perhaps express it, this feeling so difficult to analyse.  Neither sensual nor intellectual, but a sort of simple satisfaction in your presence and I long for the 18th.

      All my love, Sylvia.

      Lawrence

      I hear there is a [unclear]Merais show at Lefevre which [/unclear]  I look forward to seeing.  I can keep away no longer!  And, at the Redfern, David Jones, but whether anything new is there or not I don't know.  Still it's exciting news.

      I am so glad to be able to repay at last what I owed you.  I'm only sorry there has been such delay.

      love  L
