      [6-5-53] Bath My dearest Sylvia
      Thank you for your letter. I am so pleased to hear that your
      visit to the Greenwoods was such a success: that is good.
      I hope that by now your period is diminishing and that you
      feel cheerful and healthy. Glad that you have caught the
      sun.

      How I very much wonder are the Woods? Although Tiny
      sometimes collects alien and nasty ways on her holidays,
      I expect that Clifford is sweeter after a break. Did they
      enjoy the visit of Grace and Gordon? I hope so; or,
      perhaps, disenchantment proceeded as before?

      By the way, would you tell me, once more, the date of
      the Fete? I have forgotten.

      I shall not bother to go to Corsham or Armitage is
      away. Apparently it is unusual for him to be away
      from Bath, too. he would have to go away this week.
      However, perhaps it does not matter. The Magazine
      of Art is closing down and so Goldwater cannot, of
      couse, publish my article. He has sent my synopsis
      to Art News (the American one). What a pity about the
      end of the Mag. of Art - and not just for my sake.

      Parkam sounds divine. Lucky cat. I look forward
      to 'perusing the relevant literature' - as M.
      might say. (How is M. enjoying Italy, by the way?)
      I have been very lazy and not gone on any outtings

      Bath

      My dearest Sylvia
      Thank you for your letter. I am so pleased to hear that your
      visit to the Greenwoods was such a success: that is good.
      I hope that by now your period is diminishing and that you
      feel cheerful and healthy. Glad that you have caught the
      sun.
      How I very much wonder are the Woods? Although Tiny
      sometimes collects alien and nasty ways on her holidays,
      I expect that Clifford is sweeter after a break. Did they
      enjoy the visit to Grace and Gordon? I hope so; or,
      perhaps, disenchantment proceeded as before?
      By the way, would you tell me, once more, the date of
      the Fete? I have forgotten.
      I shall not bother to go to Corsham as Armitage is
      away. Apparently it is unusual for him to be away
      from Bath, too. He would have to go away this week.
      However, perhaps it does not matter. The Magazine
      of Art is closing down and so Goldwater cannot, of
      course, publish my article. He was sent my synopsis
      to Art News (the American one). What a pity about the
      end of the Mag. of Art - and not just for my sake.

      Parham sounds divine. Lucky cat. I look forward
      to 'perusing the relevant literature' - as M
      might say. (How is M enjoying Italy, by the way?)
      I have been very lazy and not gone on any outings
