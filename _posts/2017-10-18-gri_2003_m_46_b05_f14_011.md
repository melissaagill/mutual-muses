      Pett  8-2-52

      Dearest Lawrence,
      Your two letters cheered
      me ver much, and the
      lovely "Lionus", quite delightful!
      I'm so sorry to have made my
      lion blue--be yellow!
      I hope my "Pusso" made some
      recompence.
      I think your lectures sound
      most successful.  I am so
      glad--what large numbers you
      seem to have had!  I hope you
      were pleasantly entertained at
      West Runton.  It is frightfully
      cold here but sunny.  I expect
      you will be very glad to get home.
      I do ope you can rest a
      little on Sunday, don't you
      think you could have a meal
      at the Welcome Inn and save
      yourself fares and the journey.
      Also what about some fruit
