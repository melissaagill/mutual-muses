      THE DEREALISED ISLAND ii

      At the lock the water levels change,
      Lambent shelves, one clear in light, and one
      A dark green vase, lunar in descent:
      At night all locks are turned and in the sheets'
      Liquid caves and white formations
      Communicating vessels sink and rise,
      Ephemeral as encountered phenomena,
      Or sculpturesque as trophies of desire.

      Tongs of light pick up foreground flowers
      That flare like foliated heads
      In the borders of the country stations
      Where invisible signals clank
      Like chains across a private road:
      Elegantly at first the train appears
      Then lurches to a naturalistic standstill
      Like a cargo-ship called Semiramis.

      Sleeping tonight in a cathedral town
      Unresolved journeys of the day revive
      Persistent as a martyr and again
      The train divides the villages of bells
      Where clappers are the heads of choristers.
      The pinnacles around the octagon
      Fade like teeth as the sky closes her mouth
      And night's lips close on the journeying tongue.

      Unexpected fragments of the moon
      Above the clock tower like a quartered lemon
      Complete the jig-saw of the traveller.
      I conjecture under a low roof
      On plentiful illusions of the prospect
      Morning will offer to the optic nerve,
      What plot of colour, what elopement
      Of the succubus beyond the flowers.

      When I pull the curtains I may see
      Elms fray into the non-committal sky
      On whose choice the centred sundial waits
      And early mist support the spider's web
      To which a dream consigned the strangers
      I encountered in the recent day.
      Even the dew does not arouse
      Bushes cast of bronze in the morning.

      THE DEREALISED ISLAND  ii

      At the lock the water levels change,
      Lambent shelves, one clear in light, and one
      A dark green vase, lunar in descent:
      At night all locks are turned and in the sheets'
      Liquid caves and white formations
      Communicating vessels sink and rise,
      Ephemeral as encountered phenomena,
      Or sculptureesque as trophies of desire.

      Tongs of light pick up foreground flowers
      That flare like foliated heads
      In the borders of the country stations
      Where invisible signals clank
      Like chains across a private roada:
      Elegantly at first the train appears
      Then lurches to a naturalistic standstill
      Like a cargo-ship called Semiramis.

      Sleeping tonight in a cathedral town
      Unresolved journeys of the day revive
      Persistant as a martyr and again
      The train divides the villages of bells
      Whose clappers are the heads of choristers.
      The pinnacles around the octagon
      Fade like teeth as the sky closes her mouth
      And night's lips close on the journeying tongue.

      Unexpected fragments of the moon
      Above the clock tower like a quartered lemon
      Complete the jig-saw of the traveller.
      I conjecture under a low roof
      On plentiful illustrations of the prospect
      Morning will offer to the optic nerve,
      What plot of colour, what elopement
      Of the succubus beyond the flowers.

      When I pull the curtains I may see
      Elms fray into the non-commital sky
      On whose choice the centered sundial waits
      And early mist support the spider's web
      To which a dream consigned the strangers
      I encountered in the recent day.
      Even the dew does not arouse
      Bushes cast of bronze in the morning.
