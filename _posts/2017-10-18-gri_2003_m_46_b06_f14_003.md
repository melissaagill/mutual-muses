      3 In about 11.20 at Liverpool Street I believe. If you can spare the time do meet me. I thought I would then call on Mrs Clark, hammer in her portrait more firmly. Call at the Bergans to tell them again which pictures I want and have a 2/6 lunch there. Then go on to Kensington and get the private view cards and discuss anything necessary. Then I should have done all my business and should be free to be with you. Now if you have time I shold love you to come and see one portrait, and come to the Kensington with me, but I shall quite understand if you are too busy - but don't you think it a good idea if I get it all done at once?
      I haven't quite decided but I think I shall stay on the 19th
