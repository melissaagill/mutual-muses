      3    I have finished the "landscape" out of
      the window and the little head
      in the mirror which Tiny says is
      the only portrait she's ever seen like
      me!  I hope to do the larger head
      tomorrow; but I have to go in to
      Hastings in the afternoon to finish off
      my Christmas shopping so I shall
      have only the morning, and as I
      must do some washing not all of that.

      Poor Tiny has been quite crippled with
      prunbags today, and Clifford has
      been delayed by the fog and isn't back
      yet (12:30am).
      I was so glad to have the black
      brush you sent I have been working
      on the frame for the big nude of Clifford
      and it is a great help to have a larger
      brush.
      Look after yourself, dearest one,
      I adore you, I love you
      Sylvia

    clean_transcription: I have finished the "landscape" out of the window and the
      little head in the mirror which tiny says is the only portrait she's ever seen
      like me! I hope to do the larger head tomorrow; but I have to go in to Hastings
      in the afternoon to finish off my Christmas shopping so I shall have only the
      morning, and as I must do some washing not all of that. <br/>Poor Tiny has been
      quite crippled with lumbago today - and Clifford has been delayed by the fog
      and isn't back yet (12.30 am).<br/>I was so glad to have the black brush you
      sent I have been working on the frame for the big nude of Clifford and it is
      a great help to have a large brush.<br/>Look after yourself, dearest one, I
      adore you, I love you.<br/>Sylvia
