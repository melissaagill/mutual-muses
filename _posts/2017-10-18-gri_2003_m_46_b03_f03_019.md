      Jupiter as he lay on Leda -
           Unlike the later bird,
      Thrilled to the music of the flesh,
           All dying swan.

      Once Tangerine was seeded
           For me with orphic powers,
      But now a [unclear]gentler[/unclear] music
            Plays to desire.

      Song of a nude with flowers under her arms,
           Dispels my early vagueness:
      For now my sweetest musician,
           My time's your own.

      Song of a couch with a nude in it,
            [unclear]lyriceratical[/unclear]
      The song involves, oh, ripeness as
           I turn the sheets.

      Dandy on the committee.

      I love you

    clean_transcription: Jupiter as he lay on Leda -<br/>Unlike the later bird,<br/>Thrilled
      to the music of the flesh,<br/>All dying swan.<br/><br/>Once Tangerine was seeded<br/>For
      me with orphic powers,<br/>But now a gentler music<br/>Plays to desire <br/><br/>Song
      of a nude with flowers under her arms<br/>Dispels my early vagueness:<br/>For
      now my sweetest musician,<br/>My time's your own.<br/><br/>Song of a couch with
      a nude in it,<br/>Lyric erotical,<br/>The song involves, oh, ripeness as<br/>I
      turn the sheets.<br/><br/>Dandy on the committee<br/><br/>I love you, Lawrence
