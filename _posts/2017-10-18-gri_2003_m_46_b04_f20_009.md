      and everything is fine.

      It took us about 11/2 to get to Hastings - but it was a peaceful journey - we caught the 7.15 bus - unfortunately it was full of noisy scouts.

      I gave your love to the Woods and told them most of the news and they send their love to you, they seem well but rather tired.

      You will be very pleased to hear that Michael has scrubbed and waxed the new bedroom floor and put up the curtains and down the carpets so there is not much to do, except of course to clean out.

      Michael says he did see N & G. job - but did not tell you as a history degree was demanded- he was sorry not to - but didn't think it sounded possible
