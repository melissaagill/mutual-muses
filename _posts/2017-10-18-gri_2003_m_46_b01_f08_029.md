      Set him to imitate those works alone
      Which here were left us by our Niccolino.

      Do you know about the copy of a [unclear] Giorgione[/unclear] Ador-
      ation, or Giorgione Adoration, in the Washington National Gallery? There is a 15s. book about it,
      a kind of gallery book, very expensive. I saw it
      in Zwemmer the other day.

      I love you, Sylvia, and wish there were more time
      to tell you so but I must end now until tomorrow.

      Lawrence

      P.S. [unclear]drawing containing the text from Minerva[/unclear]
      I'm afraid Dandylion looks rather
      Victorian here. I can't think he intended
      to.
