      Dearest Lawrence,
      I enclose a copy of an advert-isement from to-days 'Times' which I think it would be well worth your while to send in for. Especially as you have, and do, lecture so much at the Tate Gallery I see it is rather a rush as the latest date for sending in is May 31st. One of the nice things about a uni-versity job is the possibility of travel and study during the vacations.
      Thank you for your letter - I feel more cheerful now and more sure that you love me. I think since the Woods have been away I have spent slightly less as I have been living well - but more simply. I ought to make cakes if I want them - but there is so much to do it seems I don't really get the time. I have got my rain but now it won't stop so that I can't get on with my fig tree

      Dearest Lawrence,
      I enclose a copy of an advert-isement from to-day's 'Times' which I think it would be well worth your while to send in for, Especially as you have, and do, lecture so much at the Tate Gallery I see it is rather a rush as the latest date for sending it is May 31st
      One of the nice things about a uni-versity job is the possibility of travel and study during the vacations

      Thank you for your letter - I feel more cheerful now and more sure that you love me. I think since the woods have been away I have spent slightly less as I have been living well - but more simpley. I ought to make cakes if I want them - but there is so much to do it seems I don't really get the time. I have got my rain but now it won't stop so that I can't get on with my fig tree
