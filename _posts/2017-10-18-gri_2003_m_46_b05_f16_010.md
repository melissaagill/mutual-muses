      3. I don't feel at all strong today - for my period has only just begun in spite of my feeling rather wretched for several days - dark round the eyes and people saying that I don't look well and I look cold - so depressing. The weather is much milder to-day - I hope to finish the seed-bed if it's fine tomorrow - I can I think if  I take it easy - I will see how I feel though.
      I went to the Bible Soc. Tea on Wednesday. I hoped to arrive after all the talk but arrived, rather too dramatically somewhat before the end - however Mrs. Hake found me a chair beside her. I missed the pleasure of seeing Fairlight pray however - apparently he screws his eyes up tightly, and gives the Almighty detailed information about the doings of the Bible Society! I nearly disgraced myself however for when I saw Clifford sitting on the platform like a thunder cloud I nearly laughed
