      For Sylvia - 8th May 1949

      (1)

      He is a lover.
      See his emblem.
      A feather and a ball
      Balanced in the tree.
      His sighs and ardour
      Corroborate the emblem.
      The stream beside his elbow
      Dances like desire
      Caught on the slanted world
      Of memory and hope.

      Beyond him is a landscape:
      The elephantine hills
      Where hermits never sleep,
      The forest and bee-hives,
      The gardens and the gates.
      On this anniversary
      Of the day that you were born,
      Of the day that love was born,
      He wishes for
      Your happiest return.


      (2)

      Lying naked in the hand of sleep,
      My supple dreamer,
      You are attended by
      Subconscious masquers.

      Apollo gives a golden cage
      Inhabited by feathers
      Floating formless in the bars
      Till you take it in your hand:
      The bars dissolve, the feathers take
      Elegant solidity
      And is a bird whose plumes
      Are golden arrow heads,
      Whose tail is an heraldic lyre.

      Ceres is nect, her gifts
      Lie heaped upon the steps
      At Sylvia's feet
      (crossed in superb repose)_,
      Bananas, apples, oranges,
      Peaches, melons, tangerines,
      And purple velvet plums.
      Pendulous clumps of grapes,
      Spilling past the wicker cage,
