      There is no audience for the one- or two-reel fictional film.
      The few series that linger today, such as Leon Errol and Joe Mc-
      Doakes, are clumsy and primitive.  One- and two-reelers today are
      either documentaries or cartoons.  Formerly short films were the
      cinematic equivalent of the short story in which one situation was
      established and, it might be explored.  It was the custom to think
      in series, however, so that the compact identity of the short story
      was blurred by the continuity of favorite characters, say Chaplin
      and the Keystone cops.
      Recently short stories have caught the attention of producers
      again and an effort has been made to fit them to the normal run-
      ning time (90-100 minutes) of feature films, not by blowing them
      up to epic proportions (The Snows of Kilimanjar), nor by adding
      a wierd causal structure to a vivid plotless original (The
      Killers), but bo containing several stories under one roof.  The
      portmanteau film, as it is sometimes called, has characteristics
      of its own which might repay analysis.  It should, perhaps, be
      made clear at the outset, that I am well aware of the role played
      by mere convenience in the popularity of this kind of film with
      the studios.  Although many actors are employed the making of sev-
      eral short pieces may represent a total economy of studio-space and
      shooting schedules.  Here it is my purpose to consider the expres-
      sive powers of teh genre as such and ask the question--can several
      distinct stories add up to something more than that many separate
      stories?  When we read a book of short stories there is no such
      feeling as the book can be read spasmodically and in any order.
