      say) is worrying about himself. We all went to the pavillion and enjoyed that.
      In the afternoon we went for a walk which included the Palace Pies. 'Elevenses'
      and 'tea' at Zetlands-lunch & dinner at the hotel. All the meals were excellent.
      The hotel is Mockley's, on the front, King's street, near the West [unclear][/unclear].
      My parents are comfortable there-do you know it?\nI have not been sleeping terribly
      well but last night I went to bed as soon as I got in & slept from 10.30 to
      10. As [unclear][/unclear] is so short this week I am eating breakfast in the

      on after Xmas, by the way.\nTime is slipping away and I must continue with my

      1 December 1951
      Dearest Sylvia
      I have heard from the Civil Service Commissioner: I have been unsuccessful. Ronald Alley (who worked at the Tate before) has got the assist. Keepership and Le Roux Smith Le Roux (that is one man) (who was also at the Tate before) had got the Deputy Keepership. However I console myself with the fact I did get on the short list at least. No word from Woolwich or York yet - not even acknowledgements.
      Yesterday I went to Brighton where my father is recovering tho' with a number of rather neurotic delays. He (as they say) is worrying about himself. We all went to the Pavilion and enjoyed that. In the afternoon we went for a walk which included the Palace Pies, 'Elevenses' and 'Tea' at Zetlands - lunch & dinner at the hotel. All the meals were excellent. The Hotel is Hockley's on the front, King's Street, near the West Pier. My parents are comfortable there - do you know it?
      I have not been sleeping terribly well but last night I went to bed as soon as I got in & slept from 10.30 to 10. As butter is so short this week I am eating breakfast in the Lewisham ABC. Soon I shall go to the library: then to Ted: then to the V and A (slides - Toulouse- Lautrec) & then home again. Banstead has asked me to go on after Xmas, by the way.
      Time is slipping away and I must continue with my day'd actions. I will write you again very soon, probably this afternoon. Meanwhile I just had to send my love
      I love you
      Lawrence
