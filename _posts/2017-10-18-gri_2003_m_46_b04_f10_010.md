      Wimbledon

      Dearest Sylvia
         I came to Wimbledon for the night because (expecting to be away from town for a week) I had used up all my food before going away.  My lectures consist of Haverhill and [unclear]Diss [/unclear]on Friday & Saturday respectively and, of course, Ipswich last Monday.  Miss Chick is being a bit dotty, I think, for, as you know, she specifically said I should not return:  but, reasonably enough Thomas at Cambridge had only arranged for accommodation for Monday, Friday, & Saturday evening. So here I am back for Tuesday through Thursday.
         I was expecting to lecture about Hogarth at Ipswich and prepared accordingly (tho' of course I had the slides for the other lecture in my bag - a bag heavy with one week's needs).  It turned out - 10 minutes before the lecture that the subject was Old Masters & Modern Art.  So I just had time to unpack and arrange the slides and improvise accordingly:  it was not too bad, I think.  An audience of 70 - mostly the local art school.
         There are one or 2 Gainsboroughs in the local museum as well as a great deal of Tudor & early Stuart woodwork and mantelpieces.  It is in a C16th house of considerable charm.  I was shown over by the curator (70 years old) with Thomas who murmured 'Amazing' and 'Yes', alternating these with 'Really'.  Thomas has one arm, a masculine wife, is a bit queer, and loves looking up old Scottish names - or any old names.

      Wimbledon

      Dearest Sylvia

      I came to Wimbledon for the night because (expecting to be away from town for a week) I had used up all my food before going away.  My lectures consist of [unclear]Hoverhill and Diss [/unclear]on Friday and Saturday respectively and, of course, [unclear]Ipwich[/unclear] last Monday.  [unclear]Miss Chick[/unclear] is being a bit dotty, I think, for, as you know, she specifically said I should not return:  but, reasonably  enough [unclear]Thoms[/unclear] at Cambridge had only arranged for accommodation for Monday, Friday, and Saturday evenings.  So here I am back for Tuesday through Thursday.

      I was expecting to lecture about [unclear]Hogarth at  I prived[/unclear] and prepared accordingly (though of course I had the slide for the atlas lecture in my bag - a bag heavy with one week's needs).  It turned out - 10 minutes before the lecture that the subject was [unclear]Old Martens[/unclear] & Modern Art.  So I just had time to unpack and arrange the slides and improvise accordingly:  it was not too bad, I think.  An audience of 70 - mostly the local art school.

      There are one or two [unclear]bainboroyls[/unclear] in the local museum as well as a great deal of tudor and early Stuart Woodwork and mantlepieces.  It is a [unclear]cloth[/unclear] house of considerable charm.  I was shown one by the curator (70 years old) with Thoms who murmered 'Amazing' and 'yes' alternating these with 'really'.  Thoms has one arm, a masculine wife, is a bit queer, and loves looking up old Scottish names - or any old names.

      Wimbledon 10-10-51
      Dearest Sylvia
      I came to Wimbledon for the night because (expecting to be
      away from town for a week) I had used up all my
      food before going away. My lectures consist of
      Haverhill and Diss on Friday & Saturday respectively
      and, of course, Ipswich last Monday. Miss Chick is
      being a bit dotty, I think, for, as you know, she spec-
      ifically said I should not return: but, reasonably
      Grays Thoms at Cambridge had only arranged for ac-
      commodation for Monday, Friday & Saturday evenings.
      So here I am back for Tuesday through Thursday.
      I was expecting to lecture about Hogarth at Ipswich
      and prepared accordingly (tho' of course I had the slides
      for the other lecture in my bag - a bag heavy with one
      week's needs). It turned out - 10 minutes before the
      lecture that the subject was Old Masters to Modern
      Art. So I just had time to unpack and arrange the
      slides and improvised accordingly: it was not too
      bad, I think. An audience of 70 - mainly the local
      art school.
      There are one or 2 Gainsboroughs in the local mus-
      eum as well as a great deal of Tudor & early Stuart
      woodwork and mantlepieces. It is in a C16th house
      of considerable charm. I was shown ones by the curat-
      or (70 years old) with Thoms who murmered 'Amazing'
      and 'Yes', alternating these with 'Really'. Thoms has one
      arm, a masculine wife, is a bit queer, and loves look-
      ing up old Scottish names - or any old names.
