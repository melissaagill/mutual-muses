      Still-life and A&R. also must do some cleaning - everything is very dusty! Beryl and George are coming to cold supper on Saturday - I expect to hear from M. C. on Monday - I wish he would come on Saturday and leave on Sunday afternoon! He may of course!
         Tiny has given me some lovely stuff for a winter coat - I'm so happy as mine though servic-eable was so "rubbed" __ I think I can have a skirt as well. It is brown and stone colour, and a soft blue in a "heavy" weave so that there are "blocks" of colour.
         I have just read your poem again - I like it very much, but do not really understand it in spite of your notes! I don't mind that, for I enjoy it
