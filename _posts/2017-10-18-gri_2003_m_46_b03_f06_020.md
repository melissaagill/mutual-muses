      7 VII 1950
      4 Rue de Navarre Paris V
      Dearest Sylvia,
      Your letter, posted on 6th July, arrived, today - not first post but sometime during the day, which is delightfully fast so that I have fresh news of you so soon. I was up a little before you on Thursday, but only a little. I'm so sorry you were up at seven but I am so happy at your creative firmness and decision, your making of opportunities to paint. Wise as well as beautiful cat - faithful to your rare creative gifts, how I adore you. Give Ting a great big kiss from [unclear]Netty[/unclear] for sitting for you - how near to completion that admirable portrait of Ting is. Tell me a little more about 'Frankie's' portrait - its size & composition so I can visualise it.

      Today, in the afternoon, I went to the Orangerie. No German primitives, however, but an exhibition much more congenial to this old lion - Louix XV et Rocaille, a pleasing exhibition of small dimensions, the purpose of which is to display 60 rococo sculptures, supported by some pictures, tapestries, drawings, porcelain. I will tell you more of it later. Then I crossed over to the Jeu de Paume and lingered for a little while at the place we sat by the pool in the Tuilleries on our one day in Paris and, in a very reminiscent mood looked at Monet & Marisol.

      Last night, at 10, thought tired I saw Madchen in Uniform, that fine, [unclear]harrowing[/unclear] film of lesbianism in a girl's school, a pre-Hitler German film. Then this evening I saw the magnificent mannerist film 'Le Parrion de Jeanne D'Arc', free, at a film society with Peter Simmons. His flat, incidentally, though noisy at night is pleasant, containing as it does two beds, separate kitchen, pressure-cooker, and so on. If I sleep in the pressure cooker it may be quieter tonight ...

      My poems are rather static at the moment but your letter, I know, will release the slight inhibition and then I will send you some verse. I am sorry, in view of your own creativity, to be so dilatory. It's only very temporary.

      Your letter, posted on 6th July, arrived, today - not first post but sometime
      during the day, which is delightfully fast so that I have fresh news of you
      so soon. I was up a little before you on Thursday, but only a little. I'm so
      sorry you were up at seven but I am so happy at your creative firmness and decision,
      your making of opportunities to paint. Wise as well as beautiful cat-faithful
      to your rare creative gifts, how I adore you. Give Tiny a great big kiss from
      Hetty for sitting for you-how near to completion that admirable portrait of
      Tiny is. Tell me a little more about "Frankie's" portrait, its size & composition
      so I can visualize it. Today, in the afternoon, I went to the Orangerie. No
      German primitives, however, but an exhibition much more congenial to this old
      lion-"Louis XV at Rocaille", a pleasing exhibition of small dimensions, the
      purpose of which is to display 60 rococo sculptures, supported by some pictures,
      tapestries, drawings, porcelain. I will tell you more of it later. Then I crossed
      over to the  and lingered for a little while at the place we met by the pool
      in the Tuilleries on our one day in Pairs and, in a very reminiscent mood looked
      at Monet & Marisot.  Last night, at 10, though tired I saw "Madchen in Uniform",
      that fine, harrowing film of lesbianism in a girls school, a pre-Hitler German
      film. Then this evening I saw the magnificent Mannerist film "Le Parisian de
      Jeanne D' Arc'", free, at a film society with Peter Simmons. His flat, incidentally,
      though noisy at night is pleasant, containing as it does two beds, separate
      kitchen, pressure-cooker, and so on. If I sleep in the the pressure cooker it
      may be quieter tonight... My poems are rather static at the moment but your
      letter, I know, will release the slight inhibition and then I will send you
      some verse. I am sorry, in view of your own creativity, to be so dilatory. It
      is only very temporary.
