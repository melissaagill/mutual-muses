      & did not hurt me tho' she had to
      drill deep in a tooth on the top on

      Wimbledon
      1 April 1953
      Dearest Sylvia,
      Thank you so much for the eggs and the chocolate. How kind of you to think of me. The eggs have, when stood up, an Easter Island look. Yawalla adores them; Hetty say ambrosia is her favor-ite; Dandy loves them all.
      Wonderful news about the studio - I am so glad, so very glad. The Woods really sound charming again. I am happy the journey went so well.
      I went to a dentist in Wimbledon today - a woman. She was charming & did not hurt me tho' she had to drill deep in a tooth on the top on the left. I have a temporary filling for Easter. She thinks she can save it. I have half a dozen other places
