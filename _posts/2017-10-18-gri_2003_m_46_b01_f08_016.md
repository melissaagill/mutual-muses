    clean_transcription: Eleven Manfel Road, Wimbledon<br/>Eight Feptember 1748<br/>My
      Deareft Eylvia,<br/>It is with Rare Pleasure that i think about <br/>Friday.
      What i wonder, will You Wear ? I long<br/>to See your Hair again, in the New
      Taft. Your <br/>Hand, so elegantly fmooth, extend'd to me, in the<br/>Ftation.
      Twnety Minutes Fhort of Eleven. How <br/>often today, among my Eighteenth Century
      Folios,<br/>dod o antocopate Feeong You. The Great Doom of <br/>the Reading
      Rome made my think, albeit Ironically,<br/>of the Historical Fictures of Hartings
      Ftation,<br/>( inferior to Mr.Hogarth's curious Inventions at<br/>Bartholemews).
      Though they are in my Head, Now,<br/>they will be Forgetten in my  agitat'd
      Delight  when We Actually meet, Once More. Another circumftance, that recalls
      You in my Hunt, as yett Unrewad'd for a Pleafant Dining-Place; I recall's the
      Gothick places in which We have had, on Cocafion, To Fup. Did you hear Mr.Summerson's
      Talk on the Wireless about the Earl of Burlington's Villa at Chifwick which
      recall'd to me, Cur Walks there in a Happy Paft.<br/>I die for Fight, Found,
      and Fenfation of You.<br/>Be affur'd, Fylvia, of my deppeft Love.
