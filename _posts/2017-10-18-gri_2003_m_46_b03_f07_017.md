      Temptation III

      The neon sighs of erotic words
      Burn like hair on a blonde's tanned legs:
      The continent of Christopher Columbus
      Asserts the potency of smoke and frontier.

      Who read the cards and found nine women there,
      Tree of clubs, nine of the emblems,
      And gave contradictory advice about journeys
      Between the watchful eyelids of the evening?

      The symmetry and discord of the tour,
      The maps with arrows, circles, and monuments,
      The places where you witnessed our desire,
      Our early tumbles or the last few jerks.

      Have you confounded the sadistic wood
      With leaves dividing like a quim,
      And hold up mirrors to reveal the girls
      Dancing like open starfish behind his back?

      Mirror, hair-brush, monogram,
      Possessions take the place of attributes:
      The wheels that might have ripped twenty ways
      Are displaced into a wrist-watch case.

      The platform of allegory
      Is crossed by evening-elongated shadows
      And we grow correspondingly, our arms
      And heads and breasts enlarged by yards.

      The ear of autonomous desire
      Welcome the password of the flesh,
      Listen and so remembers the events
      Of the libretto and the yielding hermit.
