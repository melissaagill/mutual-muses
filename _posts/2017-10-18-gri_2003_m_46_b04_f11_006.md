      his second Munch lecture: I think I shall only treat the graphic work this time. Also I must make a few notes on Tuesday's lecture which is Modern English Art. Then I hope to do some more work on two film-articles, A Symmetry of Strangers and the War-films one. At last, by the way, one missing film, without which the latter is incomplete, has been revived and I can see it at Fulham in the week: Sands of Two Jima.

      Lion is reading Conrad's Arrow of Gold, J.A.Y. Thomson's Classical Influences on English Poetry (which makes me want to write some satire, of all things), and Bukofzer S (sic) Music in the Baroque Era: I am only reading the non-technical parts of this last, which are most interesting.

      Tomorrow I am going to spend at the Tate (preparing my two lectures): then I expect to see the film I mentioned above. Tuesday I have a lecture: then Wednesday there is Munch and Banstead (with Paul probably coming to tea at the Tate between them); on Thursday I am going to Brighton to see my parents. There is part of your lion's week.

      Last Friday I joined on Charles' lecture: the subject, remember, was Massaccio and Uccello. He reached the end and then admitted he could not remember what he was talking about next week. He fumbled for his diary, producing also a dirty roll of paper and a scarlet comb with some teeth missing. Then he peered in the diary and said 'Oh, yes, I see: Massaccio and Ucello...'

      Here is a poem which was suggested, really, by the notes you made of Clifford's lecture about Generalised Others and so on:
