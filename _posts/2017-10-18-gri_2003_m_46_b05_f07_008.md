      vii

      So many lovers quail
      Before the facts of Time,
      And read his attributes
      Into the face of Love,
      Gnaw with their own teeth
      What Time has not impaired.

      For me Time's hourglass conjures
      A metaphor of breasts
      And at the name of 'death'
      I throw the flesh into no grave
      But in the lap of love
      Find my willing host.

      viii

      The necklace of living pearl
      Is not mere ornament
      Curving on your shoulders
      But a symbol nourished
      By life obscure as love:
      Your flesh inspires the pearls
      To treasured opalescence.

      So these poems strung
      Upon a verbal thread
      Only succeed when nourished
      By the flesh they honour,
      The body I adore
      Enhancing with images
      That you create and keep alive.
