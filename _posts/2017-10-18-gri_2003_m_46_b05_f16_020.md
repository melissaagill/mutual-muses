      on a low stool in the long grass (!) under the laurel hedge in the rose garden
      clasping one knee with both hands - he is not exactly in shadow although in
      the shade - there is a diffused light. the grass in the orchard shining very
      brightly - a brilliant pre-R. green through the hedge and pale blue-green nettles
      just behind him. I sketched him in roughly for proportion and shall work on
      the background until it is warm enough for him to sit for me naked. I have rubbed
      in some of the bright green and the nettles - it looks rather like a Guaguin
      at the moment! I shall work on it to-morrow and the garden - then I shall start
      on landscape I hope by the weekend - probably the fig-tree

I sketched him in roughly for proportion and shall work on the background until it is warm enough for him to sit for me naked.
