      I have written to Bilston for a double room from the 6th - so we can stay in Birmingham on the night of the 5th. It is a 3 hour journey so would, I wonder, it be best for you to come to London the 4th? and stay one night here. Otherwise you will have a lot to see at Birmingham. The Wilson exhibition is very large and I shall write, tomorrow, to the [unclear]Barle[/unclear] Institute and ask if we can see it on the afternoon of the 6th.
      Deidre and I, and some others, are going to see the Kensington museums this afternoon and so I have not time to write more. After the tangled pattern of dates I must say that I am dying, dying to see you.
