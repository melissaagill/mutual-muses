      I think that there is little change of my finding money for a hotel room. But would you come to London on the 6th? We would (I can say this rather disconsolately [?]) visit the [unclear]Alberting[/unclear] Collection. I do have a pound, so if you will come just for the day I'll send it to you for your fare. Please come, unsatisfactory as it will be. Do let me know by 1st post Monday so I can send you the fare in time.

      You see, occasionally my pragmatic attitude [unclear]to[/unclear] Time and Money doesn't work. I can't help it. Forgive me.

      Only one more [unclear]essay[/unclear] remains to be written for C-T. I have 'got' the [unclear]Batrford[/unclear] Book 'The Age of Adam'. It's enchanting.

      After I had written on Versailles paper at the V and A this morning I glanced at a book in one of the [unclear]coves[/unclear] - Berthe Morisot - 16 watercolors with Mallarme's introduction. Your apple blossom for the same [unclear]find of[/unclear] free, almost careless, sensitivity.

      Perhaps in June I can write about your paintings, Sylvia.
