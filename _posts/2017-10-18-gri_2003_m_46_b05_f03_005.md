      Wednesday
      My dearest Sylvia
         I do hope that your cold is better & that you slept
      well last night and so reduced your fatigue,
      though I have an uncomfortable feeling the Green-
      woods beds are not soft.  I wait anxiously
      for news.
         I hope also that John was pleasant on the jour-
      ney as far as Redhill.  How surprising to meet
      him at Victoria like that.
         This morning I have dusted & hoovered and I have collected my slide:  I have nearly all the impression-
      ists I asked for which is lucky and surprising.
         The T [unclear]G[/unclear] lecture went pleasantly I think ( I didn't
      run out of ideas) and so did Petersfield.  They
      are very keen there and I saw my [unclear]esch
      [/unclear] up for its 1st
      time, or rather I glimpsed it up for a moment or 2
      before & after the lecture.  It seemed nice.  I got
      home by 12.00 which was better than I expected.
         Good news. Rietman of [unclear]Netlerns[/unclear] is willing yo write
      for the next [unclear]Arles[/unclear].  An article 3000 -5000 words
      he offers!  And I have it is the end of the
      rants.
         No sign of a cold in your lion yet I am glad to report.  I love you; do look after yourself
           I love you  Lawrence

      Wednesday My dearest Sylvia
      I do hope that your cold is better & that you slept
      well last night and so reduced your fatique,
      though I have an uncomfortable feeling the Green-
      woods beds are not soft. I wait anxiously
      for news.

      I hope also that John was pleasant on the jour-
      ney as far as Redhill. How surprising to meet
      him a Victoria like that.

      This morning, I have dusted & hoovered and I have
      collected my slides: I have nearly all the Impression-
      ists I asked for, which is lucky and surprising.

      The TG lecture went pleasantly I think (I didn't
      run out of ideas) and so did Petersfield. They
      are very keen there and I saw my erch. up for the 1st
      time, or rather I glimpsed it up for a moment or two, before & after the lecture. It seemed nice. I got
      home by 12:00 which was better than I expected.

      Good news. Rietman of Netherns is willing to write
      for the next Ailes. An article 3000-5000 words
      he offers! And I can have it & the end of the
      month.

      No sign of a cold in your lion yet, I am glad
      to report. I love you; do look after yourself.
      I love you Lawrence

      Wednesday
      My dearest Sylvia
      I do hope that your cold is better & that you slept
      well last night and so reduced your fatigue,
      though I have an uncomfortable feeling the Green-
      woods beds are not soft. I wait anxiously
      for news.
      I hope also that John was pleasant on the jour-
      ney as far as Redhill. How surprising to meet
      him at Victoria like that.
      This morning I have dusted & hoovered and I have
      collected my slide: I have nearly all the impression-
      ists I asked for which is lucky and surprising.
      The TG lecture went pleasantly I think (I didn't
      run out of ideas) and so did [unclear]Plainfield[/unclear]. They
      are very green there and I saw my sch. up for the 1st
      time, or rather I glimpsed it up for a moment or 2
      before & after the lecture. it seemed nice, I got
      home at 12.00 which was better than I expected.
      Good news, Rietman of Nethern is willing to write
      for the next Altes. An article 3000-5000 words
      he offers! And I can have it & [unclear]to land if he
      wants![/unclear]
      No sign of a cold in your lion yet I am glad
      to report. I love you; do rest after journey.
      I love you Lawrence
