      4 OCT
      Dearest Sylvia
      I seem to be spending a part of every day in the Slide Dept. But now I have all I need for next week. Did I tell you I shall be away all week? I will give you an address to write to in a day or so - though I'll be at Blackheath Hill AFTER 1st part Monday morning.
      Tomorrow is Chelmsford: Contemporary Arts (in the plural) Time allowed 45 minutes! I am squeezing in Corbusier, Gropius, & Wright as well as sculpture & painting. As I have to catch the 8.30 Train I am staying at Wimbledon until tomorrow's dawn.
      Lion is probably about to write a new play in which he hopes to do for the influencing maching what he has done for the vagina dentata. Provisional title, 'Is There A Mad Scientist In The House?' characters, so far, an adolescent girl and - surprise! - a mad scientist.
      I looked in at Whitechapel Art Gal. this afternoon. I thought I'd better. It is exceedingly amusing - I do wish that you had seen it. I noticed that Wassily's collection of cat postcards is far more extensive that that exhibition here. I noted this with satisfaction.
      You tell me H. Majesty is improved. How can you say so? The King is ill - the Empire declines: cause & effect. [unclear]His Sir James Frazer lived in rain?[/unclear]  My elegy will indicate the man of science & invite all the spirits of vegetation to strike down the rotting centre of our country before it is too late. We need a young, visible king - a stranger to these shores. Where shall we turn in our our need?
      Lion has eaten his tea and it is time he went to the library & looked up the architects mentioned above.
      I love you so much, so dearly, I adore you
      Lawrence
      P.S. Dandy in his blue suit & [unclear]brown[/unclear] bow
