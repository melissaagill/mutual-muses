      4) How can we know the night

      Somnambulists persue
      Her silent chariot, on foot.
      A child is impaled on a king's crown
      Horns of dust wither in a dream.
           How can we know the night
      Except by each, a binary
      Revolving on one point of love
      Astronomers could not compute:
      Orgasm is our Nova,
      The moon our only lamp.
