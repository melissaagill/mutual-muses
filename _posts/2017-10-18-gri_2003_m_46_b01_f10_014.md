    clean_transcription: '11 Mansel Road.   4th November, 1948<br/>Dearest Sylvia,<br/><br/>  Your
      Dandylion os covered with the <br/>dust of ages.   On Wednesday he went <br/>to
      St Bartholemew''s and read the minutes<br/>of committee meetings in the 1730s
      and<br/>40s.    I found one or two new facts and <br/>a date:  trivial but not
      hitherto used.<br/>Dandylion then had a good wash and went<br/>to the N.P.G.
      today to read the vast<br/>correspondence of Nichols, the earliest<br/>writer
      on Hogarth.   Letters from 1780<br/>to about 1830!   Not much there except<br/>a
      great deal of dust and one or two min-<br/>ute items. SirHenry Hake, however,
      <br/>came to see me as I worked and we had a <br/>long talk.   He gossiped about
      Beckett<br/>and Burke, both Hogarth scholars, and<br/>made a most valuable suggestion
      about<br/>Hogarth''s linear theories.   Apparently<br/>it is a terrific privilege
      to get into<br/>the library there:   not even Beckett has<br/>seen the letters.<br/><br/>  While
      I was at the NPG I looked at<br/>some of the poets and thought that they<br/>could
      easily be mistaken, Donne, Quarles,<br/>Sidney, Butler, for courtiers and all<br/>sorts
      of other occupations.   And then <br/>I thought how lucky I was to love a muse
      <br/>and a painter:<br/><br/>    Poets, grave or smiling,<br/>    Elegant or
      slightly stout,'
