      Dandylion apologises for not putting any drawings in this time but he says he simply has not the time to sit. He is so busy. 'I'm writing like a mad lion', he says.

      When I am not actually writing I find myself terribly restless. So next week I am seeing somebody every day after work. Paul Salvet, Michael Rivett, Paul, Theo, and Molly and Eric are coming here on Friday.

      Yawolla is frankly aggressive about you while you are away and says he hates you. Dandylion is more temperate but rather melancholy. I am sure you will easily change Yawolla's dissatisfaction when he sees you again. (You know what ids are). But at the moment he is very grumpy...

      I have potted two small shoots so there are three flowers pots on the sill now. There is plenty of sun for them today.

      I love you

      Dandylion apologises for not putting any drawings in this time but he says he simply has not the time to sit.  He is so busy.  'I'm writing like a mad lion', he says.

      When I am not actually writing I find myself terribly restless.  So next week I and see somebody every day after work.  Paul Salvet, Michael Rivett, Paul, Theo, and Molly and Eric are coming here on Friday.

      Yawolla is frankly aggressive about you while you are away and he says he hates you. Dandylion is more temperate but rather melancholy.  I am sure you will easily change Yawolla's dissatisfaction when he sees you again.  (You know what ids are). But at the moment he is very grumpy...

      I have potted two small shoots so there are three flowers pots on the sill now.  There is plenty of sun for them today.
      I love you Lawrence
