      Wednesday                        [28-10-53]
      Dearest Sylvia
      Pasmore gave me the name of an architect - a friend of his - Peter Morrow. He lives in Blackheath. He or one of his colleagues will survey 46 immediately - I have to phone him this afternoon at his office of (if he is not back from a site-consultation) his home this evening, when he will arrange the details of the survey with me. I have impressed on him the need for speed.

      I am forced to write this in the train going to the V and A for lantern slides. My main news is about the surveyor. But let me say you do not have to come to town for Mrs Clark's [unclear]booner[/unclear]- parts. I am ring-ing her today. As you said in your letter I am terribly busy - with articles as well as the usual lectures (1 today, 2 tomorrow, &c.). (The Encounter art-icle, by the way, will be worth 50 to me.)

      Let me know what your aunt says and when you expect to come for I long to see, even formally and by day.

                            I love you
                            Lawrence
      PS A longer letter tomorrow, my love. x x x L
