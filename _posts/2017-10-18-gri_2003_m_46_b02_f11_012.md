      44 Queen Street - [unclear]Redcar[/unclear] Yorkshire 9 XII 1949

      Dearest Sylvia,
      Thank you for your letter though I am distressed at the news contained in it about your illness. I do hope that you are perfectly recovered now and that this evening's lecture will not be too trying. Yesterday - after writing the second letter to you - I, too, had recurring waves of nausea but not as badly as you appear to have suf-fered from, my poor, dear, cat. What a pity that you have to travel to Pett - look after yourself and keep as warm as you possibly can. Wrap up till only the tips of your whiskers and your narrowed eyes can be seen!
      Yesterday I went for a walk along the beach North of Redcar = the landscape is absolutely flat and only an ambling line of sand-dunes separates the sea from the plain. Not far from Redcar, visible among [unclear]euphemistic[/unclear] combinations of mist and smoke immense factories almost reach the water. The sands are very fine (though streaked just now with the patterns of fine sea-coal) and, in the summer, is [unclear]favoured[/unclear] by the people who work at Middlerborough and other industrial places i-land who come daily, returning home at night, apparently. The sea-front of Redcar would delight Jack A. Napes in season but at present it has a sub-dued sullen air: 'fun city', ice-cream bar, cafes -by

      Eylnia, <br/>Thank you for your letter though I am distressed at the news contained
      in it about your illness. I do hope that you are perfectly recovered now and
      that this evenings lecture will not be too trying. Yesterday - after writing
      the second letter to you - I, too, had recurring waves of nausea but not as
      badly as you appear to have suffered from, my poor, dear, cat.  What a pity
      that you have to travel to Pelt- look after yourself and keep as warm as you
      possibly can. Wrap up till only the tips of your whiskers and your narrowed
      eyes can be seen!<br/><br/>Yesterday I went for a walk along the beach North
      of Redcar = the landscape is absolutely flat and only an ambling line of sand-dunes
      separate the sea from the plain. Not far from Redcar,nulle armory euphuistic
      conditions of mist and smoke immense factories of most reach to water. The sands
      are very fine (  Dough etrealed just now with patterns of live sea- coal) and,
