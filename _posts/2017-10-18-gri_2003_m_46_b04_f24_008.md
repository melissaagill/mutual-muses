      In that case Clifford and I
      will meet you at
      5:45 - we shall be in Hastings
      then; or just before - you
      will get in at 5 o'clock I think
      let me know - your plan - for
      perhaps I will catch the 5 to
      4 bus which gets in at about
      4:15 - then I should be there
      to meet you -
      I'm so sorry to have sent
      you on a "wild goose chase"
      to Kensington - how silly of
      me.  I do apologise.
      I hope your afternoon with the
      the Banstead people went well,
      and you were not too tired
      I must read some Perandello -
      he sounds most interesting.
      I must paint now - I shall
      post this in Hastings this afternoon
      so that you get it quickly -
      I will check your lecture time,
      I love you, I adore you

      In that case Clifford and I will meet you at 5.45 - for if we catch the 5.20 we shall be in Hastings then; or just before - you will get in at 5 o'clock I think let me know - your plans - for perhaps I will catch the 5 to 4 'bus which gets in at about 4.15 - then I should be there to meet you -
      I'm so sorry to have sent you on a "wild goose chase" to Kensington - how silly of me. I do apologise.
      I hope your afternoon with the Banstead people went well and you were not too tired.
      I must read some Pirandello - he sounds most interesting.
      I must paint now - I shall post this in Hastings this afternoon so that you get it quickly - I will check your lecture time.
      I love you, I adore you, Sylvia.
