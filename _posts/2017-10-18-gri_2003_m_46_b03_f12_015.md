      In the bus
      Dearest Lawrence,
      I suppose you are about 1/2 way through your lecture. I have just returned from a glass of grapefruit-ade - not bad - I was so thirsty. I am in the front - A.1.  the bus is very crowded but there is a nice "current of air" at the front.  I do hope you caught your train safely and your lecture is going well - do tell me all about it., and the upshot of your various 'phone [unclear]calls[/unclear].  I have read 25 pages of "the Heat of the Day"  I find it very wordy so far - it describes things at great length.  Perhaps it improves later.
      I so enjoyed being with you even for so short a time.  It lessens the time apart by a little.  I so enjoyed your lecture - I hope to hear another very soon.
      Pett.
      I arrived safely, and was met by M. he did not buy any furniture.  I told him of your proposed visit on your return and he thought it a good idea.  The journey from New-haven is quite easy.  You take a train to Lewis (which takes 10 minutes) then catch the London (which is better) or Brighton train to Hastings.  Which if connections are good should take under an hour.

      In the 'bus

      Dearest Lawrence,
           I suppose you are about 1/2 way through your
      lecture.  I have just returned from a glass of grape-
      fruit-ade -- not bad -- I was so thirsty.  I
      am in the front -- A.1.  the 'bus is very crowded
      but there is a nice "current of air" at the front.
      I do hope you caught your train safely and
      your lecture is going well -- do tell me all about
      it, and the upshot of your various 'phone
      [unclear]calls[/unclear].     I have read 25 pages of "the
      Heat of the Day" I find it very wordy
      so far -- it describes things at great length. Perhaps
      it improves later.
           I so enjoyed being with you even for so short a time.
      It lessens the time apart by a little.  I so enjoyed
      your lecture - I hope to hear another very soon.
      Pett
           I arrived safely, and was met by M. he
      did not buy any furniture.  I told him
      of your proposed visit on your return and he
      thought it a good idea.  The journey from New-
      haven is quite easy -- you take a train to
      Lewis (which takes 10 minutes) then catch the
      London (which is better) or Brighton train to Hastings.
      Which if connections are good should take under

      In the bus

      Dearest Lawrence

      I suppose you are about 1/2 way through your lecture. I have just returned from a glass of grapefruit- ade - not bad - I was so thirsty. I am in the front - A.1. the bus is very crowded but there is a nice "currant of air" at the front. I do hope you caught your train safely and your lecture is going well - do tell me all about it, and the upshot of your various phone calls. I have read 25 pages of "the Heat of the Day" I find it very wordy so far - it describes things at great length. Perhaps it improves later.

      I enjoyed being with you even for so short a time, it lessens the time apart by a little. I so enjoyed your lectures - I hope to hear another very soon.

      Pett

      I arrived safely, and was met by M. he did not buy any furniture. I told him of your proposed visit on your return and he thought it a good idea. The journey from New Haven is quite easy - you take a train to Lewis (which takes 10 minutes) then catch the London (which is better) or Brighton train to Hasting, which if connections are good should take under an hour.

      In the bus

      Dearest Lawrence,
         I suppose you are about 1/2 way through your
      lecture - I have just returned from a glass of grape-
      fruit-ade -- not bad--  I was so thirsty.  I
      am in the front --A.1.   the bus is very crowded
      and there is a nice 'current of air' at the front.
      I do hope you caught your train safely and
      your lecture is going well-- do tell me all about
      it, and the upshot of your various phone
      calls.  I have  read 25 pages of "the
      Heat of the Day"  I find it very wordy
      so far -- it describes things at great length. Perhaps
      it improves later.
         I so enjoyed being with you even for so short a time.
      It lessens the time apart by a little.  I so enjoyed
      your lecture-- I hope to hear another very soon
      Pett.
         I arrived safely, and was met by M.  he
      did not buy any furniture.  I told him
      of your proposed visit on your return and he
      thought it a good idea.  The journey from New-
      Haven is quite easy-- you take a train to
      Lewis (which takes 10 minutes) then catch the
      London (which is better) or Brighton train to Hastings.
      Which if connections are good should take under
      an hour.
