    annotation_text: 3. I shall be most interested to read your "Victorian [unclear][/unclear]
      Article" also [unclear][/unclear] films. Have you seen "Orphee" again-don't
      miss it. I wonder if you have read any of [unclear][/unclear] book list. Thank
      you for your suggestions about water-colours. I am sending what seem to me the
      most conventional of my water colours for I believe it is a rather stodgy society!
      Look after yourself dearest, dear one. I hope all is pleasant at Chelmsford
      (?) on Wednesday. I shall be doing [unclear][/unclear] lantern at about the
      same time I expect. The Savages are coming to dinner tomorrow. What  a bore.
      They are very good hearted but I think I shall gently drop them! I love you
      Sylvia P.S. What time is your appointment on Monday? S.
