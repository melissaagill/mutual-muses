      I hope it did not cause you inconvenience. Thank you for taking the picture. I hope I have saved enough money for the tea. Tiny says it may have gone up. Let me know-
      By the way could you possibly send me the Little Pope - Henessy Hillyard Michael thinks he ought to read it. If you do - please send an "Eagle" I it for Clifford to see! Clifford and Masqoly were very impressed by your chapter. Clifford would like to read it again when it is convenient. The Lete has now made 102 (and something) profit. isn't it good. Thank you for all your help.
      I love you so much my dearest Lion, you are always in my thoughts - my muse, my darling. I enclose two sketches of my paintings. I feel happy about them so far. Your influence still prevails. I find this letter very scrappy on re-reading it - please excuse it - I have rather a headache
      I love you
      Sylvia
