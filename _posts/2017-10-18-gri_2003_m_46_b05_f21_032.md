      2    I like the picture of Dandy at the doctor's.  I'm so glad there its nothing
      seriously wrong.  You must take
      care not to get over-tired though--
      don't go to town for a little unless
      you really have to--and don't stay
      too long.  I get very tired and
      I'm really much tougher than you are.
      I' so glad Clifford met you--he
      said you looked fairly well and were
      better which was comforting--he
      couldn't tell me much else however!
      I'm glad you're doing your lecture for
      the society--but sorry it will mean
      that you will not come until Friday.
      I worked on my landscape on
      the shore this morning--but it clouded
      over--however I have done quite
      a lot and nearly finished it.
      I'm so glad that your parents have
      looked after you well, and that your
      nail has been treated.
      I am glad to hear the news about
      Paul.  I hope he will soon be well

    clean_transcription: 2 I like the picture of Dandy at the doctor's, I'm so glad
      there is nothing seriously wrong - you must take care not to get over-tired
      though - don't go to town for a little unless you really have to - and don't
      stay too long - I get very tired and I'm really much tougher than you are.<br/>
      I'm so glad Clifford met you - he said you looked fairly well and were better
      which was comforting - he couldn't tell me much else however! I'm glad you're
      doing your lecture for the society - but sorry it will mean that you will not
      come until Friday.<br/>I worked on my landscape on the shore this morning -
      but it clouded over - however  have done quite a lot and nearly finished it.<br/>I'm
      so glad that your parents have looked after you well, and that your nail has
      been treated.<br/>I am glad to hear the news about Paul. - I hope he will soon
      be well
