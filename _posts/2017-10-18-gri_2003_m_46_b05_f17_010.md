      Dearest Lawrence
      Now we have lords and ladies--the
      pale green arum lily, blue bells,
      apple blossom and flowering bay--the
      daffodils are quite over, and the
      cherry blossom is nearly blown away
      I do hope that you can come this
      weekend, and that the Clarks can't!
      Among other attractions--by public
      request--the Musical Phantasy is
      to be played again on Saturday!  So you
      see it is a great success.  25 being
      made for Clifford's organ!
      I hope you can get to Roses in time--
      it would be nice to go t the sex bed!
      What is the Netherne Mystery? It sounds
      like an Edwardian Villa!
      I adore all those lovely Dandy's
      what a wonderful character actor he is
      The Cowboy Dandy is sweet innocence
      personified!
      At twelve noon yesterday i was
      standing in the rain talking to
