      letter this morning, containing the \nBritain in Watercolor labels and form.
      I will make a \nnote in my diary so that I shall be sure to deliver them.\n\nI
      hope you still feel well and strong from our holiday. I know I do, feeling very
      healthy and strong. Are you sleeping well? Tell me how you are sleeping.\n\nIt
      is good to hear that M is giving you money for house-\nkeeping and, of course,
      I am glad to know that he is getting stronger. Give him my regards.\n\nI am
      sorry that you are having tense relations with Tiny. Really, she is a case.
      You must let me know about the Bank Holiday though you come here if it is too
      hard for me to come to you. I'd like to come to Pett but the im-\nportant thing
      is to be with you.\n\nHave a nice time in Rye, tomorrow (Tuesday).\n\nWhat pleasant
      news that you are painting already. I am \nglad the sketch has gone well. Yes,
      I'm sure something like Pierc's Christ is the thing. I feel a bit doubt-\nful
      about modern soldiers, but, after all, what can you do in such a case. It is
      a puzzle.\n\nThe workmen have finally arrived. They came this morn-\ning and
      their scaffolds have gone up, only at the back so far...lots of noise, though
      only of tools so far, no whistling, no 'Irish' tenors. \n\nI am working on my
      ICA lecture, surrounded by magazines and catalogues and notes. It is coming,
      but only slowly. I have been working since 10.00. I must be about 3.00 now so
      I better have lunch, post this, and then do some more work.\n\nWatts is weird.
      He wrote of Eve: 'I should like to have it criticsed in the Elgin Room of the
      B.M. while the 1st and 2nd Books of Paradise Lost were read and Beethoven's
      Moon-\nlight Sonata was being played'. Not having experienced this I suppose
      critics must remain in honest doubt.\n\nIt is 3.00. I am hungry so shall eat
      now.\n\nI love and I adore you\nLawrence"

      Blackheath
      20 July

      Dearest Sylvia

      Thank you for your letter this morning, containing the Britain in Watercolour labels and form. I will make a note in my diary so that I shall be sure to deliver them.

      I hope you still keep well and strong from our holiday. I know I do, feeling very healthy and strong. Are you sleeping well? Tell me how you are sleeping.

      It is good to hear that M is giving you money for house-keeping and, of course, I am glad to know that he is getting stronger. Give him my regards.

      I am sorry that you are baving tense relations with Tiny. Really, she is a case. You must let me know about the Bank Holiday though you come here if it is too hard for me to come to you. I'd like to come to Pett but the important thing is to be with you.

      Have a nice time in Rye, tomorrow (Tuesday).

      What pleasant news that you are painting already. I am glad the sketch has gone well. Yes, I'm sure something like Piero's Christ is the thing. I feel a bit doubt-ful about modern soldiers, but,, after all, what can you do in such a case. it is a puzzle.

      The workmen have finally arrived. They came this morn-ing and their scaffolds have gone up, only at the back so far... Lots of noise, though only of tools so far, no whistling, no 'Irish' tenors.

      I am working on my ICA lecture, surrounded by magazines and catalogues and notes. It is coming, but only slowly. I have been working since 10.00. It must be about 3.00 now so I better have lunch, post this, and then do some more work.

      Watts is wierd. He wrote of Eve:  'I should like to have it criticised in the Elgin Room of the B.M. while the 1st and 2nd Books of Paradise Lost were read and Beethoven's Moo-light Sonata was being played'. Not having experienced this i suppose critics must remain in honest doubt.

      It is 3.00. I am hungry so shall eat now.
      I love and adore you
      Lawrence

      20 July Blackheath Dearest Sylvia

      Thank you for your letter this morning, containing the
      Britain in Watercolor labels and form. I will make a
      note in my diary so that I shall be sure to deliver them.

      I hope you still keep well and strong from our holiday.
      I know I do, feeling very healthy and strong. Are you
      sleeping well? Tell me how you are sleeping.

      It is good to hear that M is giving you money for house-
      keeping and, of course, I am glad to know that he is
      getting stronger. Give him my regards.

      I am sorry that you are having tense relations with Tiny.
      Really, she is a case. You must let me know about the
      Bank Holiday though you come here if it is too hard for
      me to come to you. I'd like to come to Pett but the im-
      portant thing is to be with you.

      Have a nice time in Rye, tomorrow (Tuesday).

      What a pleasant news that you are painting already. I am
      glad the sketch has gone well. Yes, I'm sure something
      like Piero's Christ is the thing. I feel a bit doubt-
      ful about modern soldiers, but, after all, what can you
      do in such a case. It is a puzzle.

      See drawing enclosed.
      The workmen have finally arrived. They came this morn-
      ing and their scaffolds have gone up, only at the back so
      far... Lots of noise, though only of tools so far, no
      whistling, no 'Irish' tenors.

      I am working on my ICA lecture, surrounded by magazines and
      catalogues and notes. It is coming, but only slowly.
      I have been working since 10:00. It must be about 3:00
      now so I better have lunch, post this, and then do some
      more work.

      Watts is weird. He wrote of Eve: 'I should like to have
      it criticised in the Elgin Room of the B.M. while the 1st and
      2nd Books of Paradise Lost were read and Beethoven's Moon-
      light Sonata was being played'. Not having experienced
      this I suppose critics must remain in honest doubt.

      It is 3:00. I am hungry so shall eat now.

      I love and adore you
      Lawrence
