      Dearest Sylvia,
      Yes, I will bring the New Yorker (I shall
      have to make my notes on them at Pett).
      I am sorry to say you have missed the
      Brunswick Treasures--they are no longer on
      view.  They were enchanting, as you say.
      Soon I shall see your still life, and the
      other pictures, I am impatient for this plea-
      sure.
      I cannot be more exact about train than
      I was in my last letter.  Ask C what time
      he is coming back.  If it is not later than
      10.45, I will be with him:  If it is later
      I shall come on the 10.25 by myself.  There are
      2 clear alternating.
      How nice that you are tempted to come to
      town but really you should not.  It is extra-
      vagent and I shall see you on the next day:  it
      would be tiring, and the lecture will not be
      original--just a straight forward statement
      of the simple psycho analytical news.  I
      am using Bosch and Bronzive again and paraphrasing
