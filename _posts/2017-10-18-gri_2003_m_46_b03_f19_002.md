    clean_transcription: I have done an illustration to Mel-pomene. I am not working
      on the "poet in the garden" - I think you have the sketch book of it. But I
      have plenty to do - I am still working on Tiny's portrait. <br/>Have you had
      any "low down" on the S. E. A. Exhibition - Did Mr. & Mrs. Scurth like the Kensington?
      Do you know if many things were sold? Thank you very much for collecting my
      pictures. <br/>I like your Cuyp suggestion - I couldn't quite remember - there
      is a Claude - but I haven't a picture and the figure is perhaps rather small.
      <br/>I love you dearest one and am very sorry to hear of your plight, I hope
      you are not worrying and are well - I long to see you. I love you Sylvia
