      16th November.
      11 Mansel Road.

      Dearest Sylvia,

      My love, how I long for you as I go about my day to day motions without you. Today at the B.M. I imagined your pleasure at the illuminated manuscripts and your appreciative comments on the porcelain at which i estpecially looked. how we had walked in this neighbourhood, do you pointing out fanlights and such details to me, on our way to St Pancras Church.

      Skipp gave me the names of half a dozen people to let in touch with about lectures. I a project of his own comes off I shall get about seven lectures at factories (!) but this is not yet fixed. The pay will be 2 or 3 guineas. It is an encouraging prospect. And Johnson has got two lectures for me at the N.G. this month, both to schools - one, I think, the young ladies finishing school we jaked about.

      Skipp has lent me Ronald Firbank's Prancing Nigger a book I've wanted to read for ages. Do you knoy it? He says I must read Tea With Mrs Woodam which i recall you admired.

      The way your painting is developing makes Dandylion proud of you for in oiils you more structural and in watercolour you are more fluent - a two-fold advance.

      I used your library tickets today and nobody raised a shocked ayebrow and said: 'Mrs...? Greenwood'.
      get a bool in which Elizabethan poetry is called 'Formal' and 'Luxurious'. These are two qualities I like to get in my verse. I hope you are not tired of garden and landscape poems for here is just one more...

      Surely roses rob the sun
      To grow so fat, so red,
      They hide the arbour
      Where lovers loll.

      Splashes beyond the nudes
      A fountain in a shell.
      A temple to Minerva stands
      On an immaculate shelf of turf.

      A gazebo of roses
      Rises to the sun
      And putti straddle hares
      To celebrate our love

      11 Mansel Road.
      16th November.

      Dearest Sylvia,

      My love, how I long for you as I go about my day to day motions without you. Today at the B.M. I imagined your pleasure at the illuminated manuscripts and your appreciative comments on the porcelain at which I especially looked. I remembered, as I walked to see John Skipp, how we had walked in this neighbourhood, you pointing out fanlights and such detail to me, on our way to St Pancras Church.

      Skipp gave me the names of half a dozen people to get in touch with about lectures. If a project of his own comes off I shall get about seven lectures at factories (!) but this is not yet fixed. The pay will be 2 or 3 guineas. It is an encouraging prospect. And Johnson has got two lectures for me at the N.G. this month, both to schools - one, I think, the young ladies finishing school we joked about !

      Skipp has lent me Ronald Firbank's Prancing Nigger a book I've wanted to read for ages. Do you know it ? He says I must read Tea with Mrs Goodman which I recall you admired.

      The way your painting is developing mankes Dandylion proud of you for in oils you are more structural and in watercolour you are more fluent- a two-fold advance.

      I used your library ticket today and nobody raised a shocked eyebrow and said: "Mrs....? Greenwood". I got a book in which Elizabethan poetry is called 'Formal' and 'luxurious'. These are two qualities I like to get in my verse. I hope you are not tires of garden and landscape peoms for here is just one more...

      Surely roses rob the sun
      To grow so fast, so red,
      The hide to arbour
      Where lovers loll.

      Splashes beyond the nudes
      A fountain in a shell.
      A temple to Minerva stands
      On an immaculate shelf of turf.

      A gazebo of roses
      Rises to the sun
      And putti stradle hares
      To celebrate our love.
