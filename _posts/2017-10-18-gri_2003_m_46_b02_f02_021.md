      for [unclear]Aberdeen[/unclear] House - though I fear it will be rather [unclear] nocturnal [/unclear] and I warned them that yours is the one I want to follow. They send their love.

      Coopers review of [unclear]Rosenaus[/unclear] books is really too bad and it contains many errors.  I have advised her here and there about malicious shades of English! in her reply.

      I must have some tea before setting off to Banstead. I love you very much, my dearest - do not overwork with article, painting, greenwoods, Sc.

      I love you Lawrence
