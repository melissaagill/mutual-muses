      Blackheath
      13 ix 1950
      Dearest Sylvia,
      Thank you for your letter which came second post today and made me very happy for it is loving and charming. Do not, my love, be uneasy about poly-dor: nor be uneasy for The Temptation of a Saint which I sent you today, and finished a few minutes ago. At first you were concerned about Vertumnus Solo but now it pleases you: I hope the same for the two new pieces.
      Yes, I look forward to talking at length (!) about Brighton.
      Congratulations about the picture from the Church. I am sure it is good as you feel pleased with it after the protracted combat with the wind. You seem to have had to finish it rather like a commando ... I do hope you have started your picture from the Bedroom Window - it sounds delightful, and what lovely things you have to place on the sill. Congratulations, moreover, on pleasing the Savages with your portrait - I am pleased.
      I wish I were with you in the harvest setting you so vividly invoke for your urban lion. I long to see you again soon. The richness and fertility you delight in makes me nostalgic for the country because today, for example, I have had to write 12 lecture letters and I am stunned by the effort. Send me a harvest vignette with an owl, please, my beauty, it will be exhibited, I promise, at the Hundreds of Lions.
      How much I love you, my rose, my Minerva, my owl-mistress. I think of your beauty continually and love you so much. I do enjoy your letters.
      I love you
      Lawrence
      P.S. Give Metty, Clifford & Marjorie my love. Dandy

    annotation_text: "Blackheath\n13 ix 1950\nDearest Sylvia,\nThank you for your
      letter which came second post today and made me very happy for it is loving
      and charming.  Do not, my love, be uneasy about Polydor: nor be uneasy for the
      Temptation of a Saint which I send you today, and finished a few minutes ago.
      \ At first you were concerned about Vertumnus Solo but now it pleases you: I
      hope the same for the two new pieces.\nYes, I look forward to talking at length
      (!) about Brighton. \nCongratulations about the picture from the Church.  I
      am sure it is good as you feel pleased with it after the protracted combat with
      the wind.  You seem to have had to finish it rather like a commando...  I do
      hope you have started your picture from the Bedroom Window-- it sounds delightful,
      and what lovely things you have to place on the sill.  Congratulations, moreover,
      on pleasing the Savages with your portrait -  I am pleased.\nI wish I were with
      you in the harvest setting you so vividly invoke for your urban lion.  I long
      to see you again soon.  The richness and fertility you delight in makes me nostalgic
      for the country because today, for example, I have had to write 12 lecture letters
      and I am stunned by the effort.  Send me a harvest vignette with an owl, please,
      my beauty, it will be exhibited, I promise, at the Hundreds of Lions.\nHow much
      I love you, my rose, my Minerva, my owl-mistress.  I think of your beauty continually
      and love you so much.  I do enjoy your letters.\nI love you\nLawrence"
