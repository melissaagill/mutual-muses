      Dearest Laurence,

      Thank you for the lovely poem. I do enjoy it.  I have read it twice and will read it again when the daylight has gone.

      I hope by the time you come that any sadness about Doris will be dissipated.  [unclear]Tiny[/unclear] is coming back to-morrow, no Wednesday.  Unfortunately she will not be able to come to your lecture as she has a council meeting.  It is probably wise not to come until the afternoon as travelling in and out of Patt would be tiring and hardly worth it - I expect you will come by bus?  I hope so as you may remember I have a return ticket then we can travel back together on Monday.

      back together on Monday.\n   I think your lecture is at 7.0 "
