      Dearest Lawrence,

      I was feeling rather depressed and a little worried about you when Tiny came up to the studio this afternoon kindly bringing "a bottle for [unclear]Mr.[/unclear] Lion". I cheered up at once, and as no one was in earshot sand proudly to myself for the rest of the afternoon. I am getting on nicely, and am working of the french bowl having finished the 2 bottles and the table on the right.

      I'm so glad that your lecture on Claude went well - a delightful subject. Has its attendance been falling off at the Tate? I hope that your Barnstead lecture was successful too - I should like to hear a lecture on Bellini - I feel
