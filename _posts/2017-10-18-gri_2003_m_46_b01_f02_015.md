      and also the woods. Please remember me to them.  Have you done any architecture essays yet and have you reached a decision about Toynbee next term?  I shall understand if you refuse to continue but I shall love it if you do them.  I shall love you whatever your decision.  By the way - lectures - discussion - [unclear]Frogovand[/unclear].  The picture of [unclear]Frogovand[/unclear] I challenged you about is really cooler than I remembered - - - forgive me.

      You might be interested in a few prices.  This room costs 130: just near the Pantheon.  We eat at the cite [unclear]cent[/unclear] (50+ each meal) and at a restaurant on the left bank at the same price. Both available only [unclear]to[/unclear] student so be sure you and Michael get suitable papers.  And as much English food as you can carry. Eggs are plentiful at 18-20+ each.  There is no mill of course.  Tell Michael that Jalas' magazine Transition was started up again with an existential bias.  Metro [unclear]cichels[/unclear] are up a little, 50 instead of 40 a packet. Paris is nice at present - [unclear]birds[/unclear] are coming out, much sunshine.  It's probably nicer at Pett I can't help thinking.
