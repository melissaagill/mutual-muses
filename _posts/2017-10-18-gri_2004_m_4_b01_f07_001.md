      Blackheath
      Sunday

      Dearest Sylvia,

      It is 3:45 and I have just paused from writing about Hogarth. Yesterday I wrote - and typed - after I post this letter, I have written a thousand. I have develop a wonderful and I hope original theory about H's use of colour.

      The Fallacy of Height has also been added to in the last day or two and you will not be sorry to hear that M. Douglas Cooper has been added to Heron, Malraux, Fischel, & C. John McHale exchanged some books with me and when I opened one of his I found the Cooper quotation. A rare, Apollonian felicity, do you not think?

      A great advantage I have over you is that when you are away you have only Michael whereas I have your pictures. How splendid they are: Minerva, in particular, has held my attention these last two days - her great clean leap from Zeus' head symbolising the clarity and strength I hope to attain in my criticism.

      As you will realise from my opening words I have my watch back. How is yours?

      I have Mon and their Motives (from the library) and so been able to read the Henry VIII: isn't it good. I have also re-read Glover's Freud and J. articles in Horizon (He is very stern about amateur psycho-analysts!) I have got a vast and exciting book about Bosch: don't worry, it is on credit from The Blackheath bookshop so there is no urgency about payment.

      Blackheath
      Sunday

      Dearest Sylvia,

      It is 3.45 and I have just paused form writing about Hogarth. Yesterday I wrote--and typed--1,250 words and today, so far--I am continuing after I post this letter, I have written a thousand. I have developed a wonderful and I hope original theory about H's use of colour.d

      The Fallacy of Height has also been added to in the last day or two and you will not be sorry to hear that M. Douglas Cooper has been added to Heron, Malraux, Fischel, $c. John McHale exchanged some books with me and when I opened one of his I found the Cooper quotation. A rare, Apollonian felicity, do you not think?

      A great advantage I have over you is that when you are away you have only Michael whereas I have your pictures. How splendid they are: Minerva, in particular, has held my attention these last two days--her great clean leap from Zeus' head symbolising  the clarity and strength I hope to attain in my criticism.

      As you will realise from my opening words I have my watch back. How is yours?

      I have Mon and their Motives (from the library) and so been able to read the Henry VIII: isn't it good. I have also re-read Glover's Freud and J. articles in Horizon (He is very stern about amateur psychoanalysts!) I have got a vast and exciting book about Bosch: don't worry, it is on credit from The Blackheath bookshop so there is no urgency about payment. The Ducal Palace ones are in it and quite well reproduced.
