      Dearest Lawrence,
      Thank you so much for your letter and for sending me part one of your lecture. I read it through once, but carefully this morning and think it very good indeed. I do wish I could come to hear it - but if  I had the money I do not think I should have the strength, and there is so much to do. I say don't forget you were going to write an essay on the American impressionist - I forget his name for the moment. I'm glad Miss Pasmore is nice.
      You seem very busy. I hope you are quite well again now. Has the rash cleared up? I hope that you are not getting over-tired.
      I shall have to come to Hastings to do some shopping, and so I shall meet you - I shall ask Clifford when he will come - I imagine not so early as that. But I will meet the Charing
