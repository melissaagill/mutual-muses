      I have been thinking of your pictures as I worked on tomorrow's lecture. I look forward to the time when I shall be able to include a Sleigs or two in my lantern lecture.

    clean_transcription: 'In the Train   2 October 1952<br/>Dearest Sylvia<br/>   I
      have been thinking of your pictures as I worked on tomorrow''s lecture.<br/>I
      look forward to the time when I shall be able to include a Sleigh or two<br/>in
      my lantern lecture.  (I think I will have a couple made anyway<br/>from some
      of your photographs for my own use.  What do you<br/>say?  It would not be very
      expensive.)  You are developing at a <br/>marvellous rate, gaining strength
      and consistency with each painting.<br/>Cliff End and The Furnace are so impressive.  Do
      not think I disparage<br/>earlier paintings -- you know better that that.  You
      can feel that<br/>satisfactory sense of  achievement and progress with each
      new work --<br/>no sense that your latest work is not your best.  I think that
      in Chase and the Savages-- to say nothing of M and myself-- you have<br/>loyal
      and enthusiastic supporters.<br/><br/>   Banstead last night was terribly tiring.  About
      9 people -- a few more<br/>than last week, some of them different.  Next week
      will decide if the<br/>class continues or not.  Mrs Seidler has a marvellous
      aptitude for<br/>projective tests:  show her a Degas (Martelli) & she finds
      a clown''s head<br/>sideways on the table; show her a Picasso Chief & Hobby
      Horse & she de-<br/>tects a fire place.  I can''t tell you how interested I
      would be to<br/>give her Thematic Apperception and Rorschach tests ... She has<br/>so
      easy & uninhibited a response!<br/><br/>   The landscape between King''s Cross
