      Dearest Lawrence,
      Your letter, and the sweet drawing of Dandy pleased and cheered me - I felt particularly depressed to-day - and as I was painting at "the Oak" really sad - and I wept, luckily there was no one about for I had no handkerchief - I was reminded with the sudden imminent departure of Michael of my despair and misery when I was here alone November 4 years ago; when the Woods were entirely taken up with the Browns - I shall never forget it, neither will you, poor Lion! But I have never felt such a bitter misery such an unutterable despair - I do not trust the Woods at all - when they take up  some new person or thing everything is sacrificed for it and if it were not for my trust in your love I should not stay
