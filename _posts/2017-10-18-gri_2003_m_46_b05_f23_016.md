      Lawrence,
      I am in such a rush--I'm
      writing the wrong address!
      Pett  13-11-52
      Dearest Lawrence,
      I will catch the 10:10
      which arrives at 12:10--
      if you do not say NG I
      will go to the cafe on the station.
      If this is too crowded I will go
      to the waiting room.  (Saturday)
      I am interested to hear about
      the ICA discussion.  I'm
      glad you were appreciative of
      BH at least her early work.
      I think her at least as good
      as Moore--sometimes often
      better.   I wish I had heard
      you!  I'm so glad that Read
      was appreciative.  I gather
      your Saturday lecture is at the
      NG?

    clean_transcription: Lawrence <br/>I am in such a rush - I'm<br/>writing the wrong
      address!<br/>Pett 13-11-52 Dearest Lawrence<br/>I will catch the 10:10<br/>which
      arrives at 12:10 -<br/>if you do not say N.G. I<br/>will go to the cafe on the
      Station,<br/>if this is to crowded I will go<br/>to the waiting room. (Saturday)<br/>I
      am interested to hear about<br/>the I.C.A. discussion - I'm<br/>glad you were
      appreciative of<br/>B.H. at least her early work,<br/>I think her at least as
      good<br/>as Moose - sometimes - often<br/>better. I wish I had heard<br/>you!
      I'm so glad that Read<br/>was appreciative. I gather<br/>your Saturday Lecture
      is at the <br/>N.G.?<br/>
