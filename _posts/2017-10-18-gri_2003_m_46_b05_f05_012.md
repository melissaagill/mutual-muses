      X HISTORY
      Bits
      There were heads, hanging in the air
      On spider webs of weather, nodding
      And disappearing when the wind decided:
      Coming to speak for abolished towns
      These stately apparitions foster
      Nostalgias of Leconte de Lisle
      Expert of empires gone, warm hourglass
      In which the desert registers chokingly.

      Lit by the breasts of a moved lamp,
      Or twists a country fellow to a Cymon
      (margin note - Somebody up from the country)
      Whose phyllogenetic shadow races
      Across the atlas and the clock face
      from a single pair of standing feet.
      So the romantic eyes of heads
      The decollated heads themselves,
      Are grandeurs of a smaller head.

      WINTER 1951-2
