      Dearest Sylvia

      I was nervous of lecturing at Goldsmiths on work I had never seen before: however, I had all afternoon and I think it went well. It was not the art school. But the annual show of the art club of the student-teachers. Nothing outstanding, but a good level of pleasant feeling: you know. I awarded prizes, commended others and was relieved to hear my taste coincides with the teacher's views (on the whole). Was interested to meet myself in miniature: young, unshaven, shy, blonde, a bit aggressive. (game him a prize.)

      As they paid me there and then here I am in the [unclear]Gallmont[/unclear] Restaurant [unclear]Lewislan[/unclear] eating supper. Alas, no sound of the film (White Witch Doctor). it is oddly peaceful here: padded couch, hardly any customers, remote traffic sounds, and the modernistic 30-ish design. I know it is hideous but it has a tiny accent of [unclear]poingency[/unclear] and pure history already. I am not going to the film afterwards: having refused to go to Intolerance with the [unclear]Cordells[/unclear] I am on my way home to continue with the Italian article. It is like the post-man: not come yet - but, oh, that heavy [unclear]beathing[/unclear].

      Met Mambridge & Godwin at Golsmiths, of course. I so like them. Miss Lowell and Ian [unclear]Machergie-Ken[/unclear] appeared again, too.

      More later. Goodnight darling. I love you.

      Dearest Sylvia

      I was nervous of lecturing at Goldsmiths on work I had never seen before: however, I had all afternoon and I think it went well. It was not the art school, but the annual show of the art club of the student-teachers. Nothing outstanding: but a good level of pleasant feeling: you know. I awarded prizes, commended others and was relieved to hear my taste coincided with the teachers' views (on the whole). Was interested to meet myself in miniature: young, unshaven, shy [unclear]blonde[/unclear], a bit aggressive. (Gave him a prize).

      As they paid me there and then here I am in the Gaumont restaurant, Lewisham eating supper. Alas, no sound of the film (White Witch Doctor). It is oddly peaceful here: padded couch, hardly any customers, remote traffic sounds, and the modernistic 30-ish design. I know it is hideous but it has a tiny account of poignancy and pure history already. I am not going to the film afterwards: having refused to go to Intolerance with the Cordells I am on my way home to continue with the Italian article. It is like the post-[unclear]war[/unclear]: not come yet - but, oh, that heavy breathing.

      Met Manbridge & Godwin at Goldsmiths, of course. I do like them. Miss Cowell and Ian [unclear]Machergie-Kerr[/unclear] appeared again, too.

      More later. Goodnight darling. I love you.
