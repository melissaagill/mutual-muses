      Pett        19.10.51

      Dearest Lawrence,
           A note in haste before
      rushing to my motif to send
      my love. I hope your cold
      has gone at last, do get
      rid of it - if they hang on
      at this time of year they incline
      to become winter permanancies.
           Parsons is what he at first
      appeared, nothing behind a huge
      mustache! How annoying!
           I will ask Clifford as to
      [unclear]Janima[/unclear] - I think she  is pretty
      reliable now - but I agree as
      to caution(?)
                My suggestion for the Gainsborough
      article's Botticelli's "Mars and
      Venus", or [unclear]Crovelli's [/unclear]S. Sebastian
      and St. Jerome altar piece.
