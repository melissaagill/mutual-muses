      2    and I must return on Tuesday,
      and so spend the absolute
      minimum.  I'm so sorry, my
      love, but I am really terrified!
      It is very disappointing but
      I shall have to "pull in my horns"
      or I shall not be able to live.
      Will you therefore be so kind
      as to try to make an appoint-
      ment for me for Monday morning
      with the Leicester and the Lege-
      galleries?  (It is Patrick Phillips
      at the Leicester) and for Michael
      Chase as early as possible in the
      afternoon;  Then I will take
      Mrs. Bergman's picture either between
      lunch and tea- (I hope) - or
      tea and dinner.  I will write and
      say I will bring ti and ask for
      my money!
      You see Friday is no good
      as it's the day of the funeral.
      I think I had better bring up
      "my boy" as well and see what
      Christies thinks he is worth.

      2 and I must return on Tuesday,
      and so spend the absolute
      minimum. I'm so sorry, my
      love, but I am really Terrified!
      It is my disappointing but
      I shall have to "pull in my horns"
      or I shall not be able to live.
      Will you therefore be so kind
      as to try to make an appoint-
      ment for me for Monday morning
      with the Leicester and the Lege-
      galleries? (It is Patrick Phillips
      at the Leicester;) and for Michael
      Chase as early as possible in the
      afternoon; then I will take
      Mrs. Bergman's pictrure either between
      lunch and tea - (I hope) - or
      tea and dinner. I will write and
      say I will bring it and ask for
      my money!
      You see Friday is no good,
      as it's the day of the Funeral.
      I think I had better bring up
      "my boy" as well and see what
      Christies think he is worth-
