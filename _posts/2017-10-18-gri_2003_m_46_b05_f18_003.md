      have finished the "Footpath to Fair-

      Yesterday I went down on the
      shore with Clifford and we had
      a most delicious bathe--sun
      and no wind; and I worked on
      my painting.  I have now done
      the foreground sea and the shore.
      I have yet to do the two break-
      waters--the sea's horizon and to
      sky.  I had hoped to go again
      this afternoon--it is a lovely
      day after a mercifully wet night
      (as it should be!) But I slept
      so badly.  Read Quenell nearly
      all night and have now finished
      it.  I think it quite good.

      3. As I think I told you I
      have finished the 'Footpath to Fair-
      light - or to New Moon"! I like
      it and so do T. and C. Its
      Tiny's birthday to-day - but I
      don't think she's a bit pleased
      with it! I'm giving them supper
      this evening.
      Yesterday I went down on the
      shore with Clifford and we had
      a most delicious bathe. Sun
      and no wind; and I worked on
      my painting. I have now done
      the foreground sea and the shore
      I have yet to do the two break-
      waters, the sea's horizon  and the
      sky. I had hoped to go again
      this afternoon - it is a lovely
      day after a mercifully wet night
      (as it should be!) But I slept
      so badly - Read [unclear]Quenell[/unclear] nearly
      all night and have now finished
      it. I think it quite good
