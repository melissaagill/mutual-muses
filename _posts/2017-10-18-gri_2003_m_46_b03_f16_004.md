      I love you so much. I have great confidence
      in your future. I am sure this is only
      a temporary difficulty which will be sowed shortly.
      Only I do think it wise to borrow as
      little as possible, otherwise it's a drain
      and a worry for so long.
      I think of you all the time and with
      such happiness recall our early [unclear]meeting[/unclear]
      as well as our present [unclear]jolys[/unclear]
      I so much admire your new poems, - and
      was very interested to hear [unclear]past of "Anadue[/unclear]
      and Naxos" yesterday - it seems
      delightful.
      You will be sorry to hear that [unclear]news,
      Asundell Eisdale[/unclear] is dead - only 69 too -
      ridiculous! Poor lady I think she was
      [unclear]far[/unclear] from [unclear]riels.[/unclear]
      I shall post this now, with my love
      dearest one. Hoping all goes well with
      you. Let me know soon. Clifford and
      Marjorie have asked tenderly after you
      I love you, my darling, I love you
      Sylvia.

      I love you so much - I have great confidence
      in your future - I am sure this is only
      a temporary difficulty which will be sorted shortly.
      Only I do think it wise to borrow as
      little as possible, otherwise it's a drain
      and a worry for so long.
           I think of you all the time and with
      such happiness recall our early meeting
      as well as our present [unclear]jolys[/unclear]
           I so much admire your new poems -- and
      was very interested to hear part of "[unclear]Amadue
      [/unclear]auf Naxos" yesterday - it seems
      delightful.
           You will be sorry to hear that [unclear]Mrs.[/unclear]
      [unclear]Arundell[/unclear] Eisdale is dead -- only 69 too --
      ridiculous! Poor Lady I think she was
      far from rich -
           I shall post this now, with my love
      dearest one - hoping all goes well with
      you - let me know soon. Clifford nd
      Marjorie have asked tenderly after you
                  I love you, my darling, I love
      you
           Sylvia
