      I have just learned that [unclear]Park[/unclear] Nelsons has already contacted Foster and Foster about the things I was supposed to discuss with them this morning. Why have me go in if South was going to do it? I cannot help the deal if I do not know what you are doing. I was immediately at a disadvantage when I tried to discuss a lower price than 2 400 because I had no way of know-ing what South (and you?) had said. So the [unclear]whole  [/unclear]meeting was inconclusive. I suppose you will hear the next news from South. I don't see what I can do now.
      I appreciate the need for speed, of course, and I will do all I can : so let me know the next move. I am afraid have achieved nothing this morning.
      Still I am very busy: a lecture every day and I am writing about [unclear]Pazuore[/unclear] and about Paolozzi. Two weeks and I must have sent off another report from London to Art News: inside 2 weeks. Stephen [unclear]Spender[/unclear] is interested in my Paul Klee article, too.
      When I have a minute I have many [unclear]film [/unclear]ideas for my book. I have started collecting stills for it, by the way.
      I am glad the [unclear]Saroges [/unclear]& Diana (and her boys) are so nice.
      I don't think you should stay with me until you know [unclear]certainly [/unclear]
      M is not co-operating - much as I want you. Don't you [unclear]agree[/unclear] really - But I love you so.
      Love you
