      Dearest Lion, I'm very distressed that you have a cold-and do hope that it is better. Do look after yourself. I must say that I think it was very silly and irresponsible to stay so late at Ithel's I suppose you are being influenced by Paul's silly  conventional habits. I feel very hostile towards him. I do hope you didn't put Baustead off-as you have behaved rather unreliably this term and it doesn't do for a lecturer. Thank you so much for taking all my works to the various places. I take it that the "Poet and the Garden" arrived safely and the glass was unbroken. I wonder how you liked the frame. I thought it looked very well. Michael is not buying the oil until Tuesday. Don't bother, take the two on Saturday

      21-3-51  Pett  Dearest Lion,
      I'm very distressed that you
      have a cold - and do hope that
      it is better - Do look after yourself.
      I must say that I think it was
      very silly and irresponsible to stay
      to late at Ithel's.  I suppose you
      ae being influenced by Paul's silly
      convenional habits.  I feel very
      hostile, towards him.  I do hope
      you didn't put Banstead off - as
      you have behaved rather unreliably
      this term and it doesn't do for
      a lecturer.
      Thank you so much for taking
      all my works to the various
      places - I take it that the
      "Poet in the Garden" arrived safely
      and the glass was unbroken - I
      wonder how you liked the frame -
      I thought it looked very well.
      Michael is not bringing the oil
      until Tuesday - don't bother,
      take the two on Saturday-

      I must say that I think it was

      you didn't put Baustead off as
      you have behaved rather, unreliably
      then term and it doesn't do for
      a lecturer.
      Thank you so much for taking

      "Poet in the Garden" arrived safely
      and the glass was unbroken--I

      Dearest Lion,

      I'm very distressed that you have a cold - and do hope that it is better. Do look after yourself. I must say that I think it was very silly and irresponsible to stay so late at Ithel's. I suppose you are being influenced by Paul's silly conventional habits. I feel very hostile, towards him. I do hope you didn't put Banstead off, as you have behaved rather unreliably this term and it doesn't do for a lecturer.

      Thank you so much for taking all my works to the various places - I take it that the "Poet in the Garden" arrived safely and the glass was unbroken - I wonder how you liked the frame - I thought it looked very well. Michael is not bringing the oil until Tuesday - don't bother, take the two on Saturday -
