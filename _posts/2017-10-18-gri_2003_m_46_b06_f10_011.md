      Tuesday
      Dearest Sylvia
      I miss you. Since you left yesterday I have felt sad and incomplete. All the things I said to you I need to hear myself: "not to worry, be calm." I love you. I feel a void since you have gone, since we have been parted. The room is dead without you: even as I write this I feel [unclear]curiosily[/unclear], unhappily solitary. I do love you: I love you so dearly.
      Was your journey comfortable? I hope you were comfortable physically- [unclear]tho'[/unclear] as a result of the journey I am sad and wanting you.
      Of course - you'll be seeing Diana. It will be good for both of you meeting again.
      Yesterday - after we parted - I went to Wimbledon. Then Harpenden : 18 people, so the class will continue, I imagine. I felt rough but better than I expected. But I had a [unclear]Cenilale mylt[/unclear] : I could not sleep, [unclear]or[/unclear] get comfortable. I even thought about things - you know. But I gave my lecture alright at the N G this morning & have had a quiet afternoon at home. I am going to the [unclear]Cambridge[/unclear]

      Tuesday
      Dearest Sylvia
      I miss you. Since you left yesterday I have felt sad and
      incomplete. All the things I said to you I need to hear my-
      self: "not to worry, be calm." I love you. I feel a void
      since you have gone - since we have been parted. The
      room is dead without you: even as I write this I feel
      curiously, unhappily solitary. I do you you: I love
      you so dearly.
      Was your journey comfortable? I hope you were com-
      fortable physically - tho' as a result of the journey
      I am sad and wanting you.
      Of course - you'll be seeing Diana. It will be good
      for both of you meeting again.
      Yesterday - after we parted - I went to Wimbledon.
      Then Harpenden: 18 people, so the class will con-
      tinue, I imagine. I felt rough but better than
      I expected. But I had a terrible night: I could
      not sleep, nor get comfortable. I even thought
      about things - you know. But I gave my lec-
      ture alright at the NG this morning & have had a quiet
      afternoon at home. I am going to the Mansbridge

      Dearest Sylvia
      I miss you.  Since you left yesterday I have felt sad and
      incomplete.  All the things I said to you I need to hear my-
      self:  "Not to worry, be calm."  I love you.  I feel a void
      since you have gone--since we have been parted.  The
      room is dead without you:  even as I write this I feel
      curiously, unhappily solitary.  I do love you:  I love
      you so dearly.
      Was your journey comfortable?  I hope you were com-
      fortable physically--tho as a result of the journey
      I am sad and wanting you.
      Of course, you'll be seeing Diana.  It will be good
      for both of you meeting again.
      Yesterday--after we parted--I went to Wimbledon.
      Then Harpenden:  18 people, so the class will con-
      tinue, I imagine.  I felt rough but better than
      I expected.  But I had a terrible night:  I could
      not sleep, nor get comfortable.  I even thought
