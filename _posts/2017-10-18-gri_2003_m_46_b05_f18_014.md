      to see you next weekend - I was counting the days -
      By the way I have asked Mrs. [unclear]Toldes[/unclear] to sit for [unclear]Armida[/unclear] - she does not seem sure so I shall not press her.
      I think I shall get the "G.A" done in time but I wish you could see it before I show it!
      By the way did you see Newton's letter a couple of [unclear]"disteners"[/unclear] ago? I'm sure you did that's why you blized him! How blind can you be?
      I enclose something from the Radio Times 1949 that I was wiping my brush on - I haven't read it but it might have something relevant.
      I love you, dear poet, and miss you.
      I love you

      the way I have asked Mrs Foldes to sit for Asmida - she does not seem sure so
      I shall not press her.<br/>I think I shall get the "G.A." done in time but I
      wish you could see it before I show it!<br/>By the way did you see Newton's
      letter a couple of "Listeners" ago? I'm sure you did that's why you idolized
      him! How blind can you be?<br/>I enclose something from the Radio Times 1949
      that I was wiping my brush on - I haven't read it but it might have something
      relevant.<br/>I love you, dear poet, and miss you.<br/>I adore you<br/>Sylvia
