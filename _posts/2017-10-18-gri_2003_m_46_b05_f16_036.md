      mean missing a day or two with
      lectures - what the Hell are
      you going to do with the other
      13 hours? How do you think
      I'd ever have any paintings
      done if I went on like that -
      and you aren't even dependent
      on the light as I am. When
      you went to the LeFoure you used
      to have fits of nausea in order
      not to have to go. So did Michael
      but he went. Your mother always
      has migraine - she need not have
      it, but does the things to promote
      it, just as George escapes from her
      duties into bed - you know the contempt
      I feel for her. I hope at least
      that you recognise your
      symptoms. I understand cinema

      you went to the  you used to have fits of nausea in order not to have to go.
      So did Michael but he went. Your mother always has migraine. She need not have
      it, but does the things to promote it, just as Georgie escapes from her duties
      into bed. You know the contempt I feel for her. I hope at least you recognise
      your symptoms. I understand cinema going now- back to the safety

    annotation_text: 3 writing a day - Jesus Christ! two hours, and that this may
      mean missing a day or two with lectures - what the Hell are you going to do
      with the other 13 hours? How do you think I'd ever have any paintings done if
      I went on like that - and you aren't even dependent on the light as I am. When
      you went to the Lefevre you used to have fits of nausea in order not to have
      to go. So di Michael but he went. Your mother always has migraine - she need
      not have it, but does the things to promote it, just as George escapes from
      her duties into bed - you know the contempt I feel for her. I hope at least
      that you recognise your symptoms. I understand cinema going now - back to the
      safety
