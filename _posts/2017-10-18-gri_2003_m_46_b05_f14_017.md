      Saturday 9th
      Feb.
      Dearest Lawrence,
      Just a note to send my
      love and say that I hope
      your lectures went well; also
      that you will have a pleasant
      Sunday.  I expect you have
      finished one lecture by now
      it is just after 4 o'clock!
      M. doesn't think he can
      see me on Saturday as he can't
      get away in time, in any
      case it would not be until
      the evening.  So I will come
      to our lecture, but go with
      Miss Lacey if she wants to.
      I didn't see your article
      in Art News this week?
      I love you, dearest Lion,
      I love you.
      Sylvia
      P.S.  I have done the pineapple
      S.
