      been writing roughly for 12 hours except to eat. I have\ncompleted my review
      of the Phillips Col. catalogue. I have rewritten\n& typed my (still unfinished)
      Episodic films chapter. I have started\nwriting the steer article down from
      my existing notes. And I have\nmade a synopsis of the Modern Woman series to
      show Tom\nMoore whom I plan to see this week. I have typed some poems,\ntoo.
      And I have a mild form of writer's cramp: anyway my\nright arm aches. (I enclose
      a copy of the synopsis for you to see.)\nOn Thursday next CJ is taking me to
      Pevener's lecture on\nPhases in 17c Dutch art; then Madge is joining us for
      dinner -\nand a movie.\nWould C. lend us his membership card to the arts so
      that\nwe could see Cocteau's Holy Terrors - as it is call here - \nnext week?
      I think we should see it, don't you? The seats\nare not too expensive.\nI enclose
      3 poems: the last one I read you an earlier version\nof; the 1st one I wrote
      in the summer; the middle one was \nprompted by my walk to the post this afternoon
      with \nyour letter. So that is the latest I have written.\nWell I shall retire
      to bed now and look up a few facts\nabout Dutch  Art before [unclear]Somnas
