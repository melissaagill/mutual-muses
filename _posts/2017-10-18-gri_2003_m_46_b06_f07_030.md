      Sunday
      28.7.53

      Dearest Sylvia

      How lucky you are to be able to swim. On the other hand how unlucky you are in your father: it really is too bad that he should persecute you by mail now. Never mind, forget it - he is not worth attention. He only seems to amount to - say - a subsidiary character in a John O'Hara short story.

      You are kind enough to ask about the LCA discussion. The last thing I can do, I think, is send you the typescript of my opening remarks - which I read. (let me have it back sometime, if you would).

      I can see that Chandler is a 'sadistic homosexual'. Why is he 'strongly puritan'? because Marlowe doesn't fuck everybody he could? I should have thought his abstinence had something to do with the final moral effect of Chandler.

      I do hope that your nightmares concerning Michael have abated now and that you are sleeping better.

      I am waiting impatiently to hear all about the fete. I hope that your plays went well - I am certain that they did: tell me all.

      I am glad you like the DAWN poem. Encouraged

      [28-7-53]
      Blackheath
      Sunday
      Dearest Sylvia
      How lucky you are to be able to swim.  On the other
      hand how unlucky you are in your tarte:  it really
      is too bad that he shoved persecute you by mail-
      now.  Never mind:  forget it--he is not worth at-
      tention.  He only seems to amount to--say--a sub-
      sidiary character in a John O'Hara short story.
      You are kind enough to ask about the ICA discus-
      sion.  The best thing I can do, I think, is send you
      the typescript of my opening remarks--which I
      read.  (et me have it back sometime, if you
      would.)
      I can see that Chandler is a 'sadistic homosexual'.
      Why is he 'strongly puritan'?  Because Marlowe
      doesn't fuck everybody he could?  I should have
      thought his abstinence had something to do with the
      final moaral effect of Chandler.
      I do hope that your nightmares concerning Michael
      have abated now and that you are sleeping better.
      I am waiting impatiently to hear all about the fete.
      I hope that your plays went well--I am certain
      that they did:  tell me all.
      I am glad you like the DAWN poem.  Encouraged
