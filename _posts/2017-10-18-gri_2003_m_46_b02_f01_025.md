      I am delighted with the pull-over.  Would you please thank Tiny very much and also the lady who knitted it.

      The soap was very thoughtful and I am sure it will keep us polished and spotless for a long time.  The Owls think the smell very nice and so do I.

      'Near Tunbridge' by the way is quite wrong.  Skipp's secretary was misleading.   The place is Crayford, towards Dartford.  The Banstead course is 'Appreciation of Painting' so I can mainly use my Toynbee lectures again.

      I am glad about your watercolour - I was confident that you could complete it alright.

      Here is a NOCTURNE FOR SYLVIA which might be read before the AUBADE perhaps:

      Luminous orchards of planets
      Blossom in the night summer
      When my dream is peeled like fruit
      To the logic of your name

      Waking from dream to what
      Was once no less a dream
      I meet your body in the sheets
      My love sleeping in the orchard.

      21st January 1949                   11 Mansel Road, Wimbledon

      Dearest Sylvia,

            I am delighted with the pull-over.  Would you please
      thank Tiny very much and also the lady who knitted it.
      And thank you very much for it was your idea - and the
      colour is just right, and I adore the pattern, and think
      it will keep me warm, dearest.  I am going to wear it
      today and shall feel very smart.  You can see in one of
      the drawings Dandylion trying it on with one of his bows
      (I hope you can see which one despite the inadequacies
      of his old paint-box).  Also you can see him wearing it
      on a visit to Charles I's statue at Charing Cross with
      the white owl, though this is poetic lisence because he
      really went early in the week.  The third drawing, by
      the way, shows Dandylion carrying Antal's Florentine
      book, puffing slightly...

          The White Owl wonders if with the remaining ounce of
      wool the work-party would make him a pull-over to match
      mine...

          The soap was very thoughtful and I am sure it will
      keep us polished and spotless for a long time.  The
      Owls think the smell very nice and so do I.

          'Near Tunbridge' by the way is quite wrong.  Skipp's
      secretary was misleading.  The place is Crayford, to-
      wards Dartford.  The Banstead course is 'Appreciation
      of Painting' so I can mainly use my Toynbee lectures again.

          I am glad about your watercolour - I was confident that
      you could complete it alright.

          Here is a NOCTURNE FOR SYLVIA which might be read be-
      fore the AUBADE perhaps:

      Luminous orchards of planets
      Blossom in the night summer
      When my dream is peeled like fruit
      To the logic of your name

      Waking from dream to what
      Was once no less a dream
      I meet your body in the sheets
      My love sleeping in the orchard.

      Sylvia, my dearest, I love you,
      Lawrence

      Dearest Sylvia,

      I am delighted with the pull-over.  Would you please
      thank Tiny very much and also the lady who knitted it.
      And thank you very much for it was your idea, and the
      colour is just right, and I adore the pattern, and think
      it will keep my warm , dearest.  I am going to wear it
      today and shall feel very smart.  You can see in one of
      the drawings Dandylion trying it on with one of his bows
      (I hope you can see which one despite the inadequacies
      of his old paint-box).  Also you can see him wearing it
      on a visit to Charles I's statue at Charing Cross with
      the white owl, though this is poetic licence because he
      really went early in the week.  The third drawing, by
      the way, shows Dandylion carrying Antal's Florentine
      book, puffing slightly...

      The White Owl wonders if with the remaining ounce of
      wool the work-party would make him a pullover to match
      mine...

      The soap was very thoughtful and I am sure it will
      keep us polished and spotless for a long time.  The
      Owls think the smell is very nice, and so do I.

      'Near Tunbridge' by the way is quite wrong.  Skipp's
      secretary was misleading.  The place is Crayford, to-
      wards Dartford.  The Banstead course is 'Appreciation
      of Painting', so I can mainly use my Toynbee lecture again.

      I am glad about your watercolour, I was confident that
      you could complete it alright.

      Here is a NOCTURNE FOR SYLVIA which might be read be-fore the AUBADE perhaps:

      Luminous orchards of planets
      Blossom in the night summer
      When my dream is peeled like fruit
      To the logic of your name

      Waking from from dream to what
      Was once no less a dream
      I meet your body in the sheets
      My love sleeping in the orchard.

      Sylvia, my dearest, I love you
      Lawrence
