      I'm so sorry to hear of the proverty
      of the [unclear][/unclear]naming[unclear][/unclear] branch of this family.   I had hoped Eric could get a good job now - What about his commercial work? I do hope Paul succeeds with his textile designs - otherwise they'll all have to go on the streets!  M always seems to think that a solution!
      I am very much looking forward to your new 100 line poem - how quick.
      I seem quite well again now _Clifford gave me a lecture proving that there is nothing to worry about!
      Aunt Margaret arrived safely and so charming - we went for a walk down Panel Lane and back over the hill where there is that fine view of the marches which I long to paint.   To-day we shall go by the shore.
      I love you so much and long for you - dearest one
      I love [unclear][/unclear]yoryWiaz[unclear][/unclear]
