      Imaginary Goods : For Sylvia

      These are the emptiest of words,
      Shake them and nothing rattles,
      But I wish their silence
      Were an  inventory of matching gifts.

      Since you are what you give
      Only a Peruvian catalogue,
      A Petrarchan laundry-list
      Of Dior, Fortunoff, The Ritz,
      The hours of the night in a loose-leafed book
      (With capital lions, black unicorns, and owls),
      A fan you painted on, forgot, and lost,
      Found under something and restored

      Xmas 1982
