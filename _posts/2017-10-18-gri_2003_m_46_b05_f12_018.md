      This is not one of the works on which Griffith's great re-
      putation rests. Nevertheless it is not the work of a hack.
      The handling has a straightforwardness and lack of ostentation
      which is expressive. The discriminating and economical comp-
      osition of every scene cannot fail to impress the spectater.
      We have in fact that familiar phenomenon of the movies - a re-
      markable technical authority lavished on a subject-matter design-
      ed for the comfort of morons. It is like most of the films of
      John Ford - a beautiful piece of nothing. The simpliciity and
      certainty of Griffith's technique requires a serious theme: as
      it is the novelettish material constantly betrays him.
      This combination of brilliant 'means' and foolish 'end' leaves
      one, not as I suppose Griffith intended, with a heartening view
      of the world, but with a detached aesthetic interest in manner
      alone.

      This is not one of the works on which Griffith's great re-
      putation rests. Nevertheless it is not the work of a hack.
      The handling has a straightforwardness and lack of ostentation
      which is expressive. The discriminating and economical comp-
      osition of every scene cannot fail to impress the spectator.
      We have in fact that familiar phenomenom of the movies - a re-
      markable technical authority lavished on a subject-matter design-
      ed for the comfort of morons. It is like most of the films of
      John Ford - beautiful piece of nothing. The simplicity and
      certainty of Griffith's technique requires a serious theme; as
      it is the novelettish material constantly betrays him.
      This combination of brilliant 'means' and foolish 'end' leaves
      one, not as I suppose Griffith intended, with a heartening view
      of the world, but with a detached aesthetic interest in manner
      alone.
