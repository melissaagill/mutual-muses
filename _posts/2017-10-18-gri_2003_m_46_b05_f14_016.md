      else could have made such a speech!

      I adore your drawing - it's delicious.  I really must inspect St Pancras and Euston.  I viewed them with an unseeing eye before.

      It seems possible that I may meet M. on Saturday.  I will let you know on Monday - but in any case if Miss Lacey wants you to go with her do so, for you can't put her off again.  I expect I shall come up by bus as I have the return half but again I will let you know.

      I have now finished the marmalade and shall start going to bed!

      Barbara Morris is here with Tiny - she has been looking at my pictures and seems interested in my show so that I hope she will cone to it!  We must make some hits!

      I adore you, I love you
      My darling, I love you
      Sylvia

      else could have made such a speech!
      I adore your drawing - it's delicious  I really must inspect St. Pancras and Euston.  I viewed them with an unseeing eye before.
      It seems possible that I may meet M. on Saturday. I will let you know on Monday - but in any case if [unclear]wise[/unclear] Lacey wants you to go with her do so, for you can't put her off again.  I expect I shall come up by bus as I have the return half, but again I will let you know.
      I have now finished the [unclear]Marmaldde[/unclear] and shall start going to bed!
      Barbara Morris is here with Tiny - she has been looking at my pictures and seems interested in my show so that I hope she will come to it!  We must make out [unclear][/unclear]!
      I adore you, I love you my darling. I love you.
