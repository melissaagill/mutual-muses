      Dearest Sylvia,

      I think it is wonderful that you have worked for 5 hours already (in your letter of 13th) and I do hope that you have had the opportunity to continue work on The Flight. I am glad that Ruth came yesterday and that you have a frame and stretcher. What a splendid start on what I am sure will be a fine picture. I wonder if, today, as you expect you will work indoors on it? That is what I am going to do, about my lectures.

      I will send Clifford 'The Age of Johnson' soon - so expect a vast lumpy parcel soon. Yawolla has taken most of our string with him but I shall manage somehow!

      I met John McHale and we talked about films. I saw The Black Rose and Destination Moon and High Lonesome. None of them very good - only mildly interesting from our point of view. All were in Technicolor - what an ordeal.

      Peter Judge has practically finished the designs for the charts which are excellent, I think. Now they have to be printed and engraved and assembled.

      what I am sure will be a fine picture. I wonder if, today, as you expect you
      will work indoors on it? That is what I am going to do, about my lectures.<br/><br/>I
      will send Clifford 'The Age of Johnson' soon - so expect a vast lumpy parcel
      soon. Yawolla has taken most of our string with him but I shall manage somehow!<br/><br/>I
      met John McHale and we talked about films. I saw The Black Rose and Destination
      Moon and High Lonesome. None of them very good - only mildly interesting from
      our point of view. All were in Technicolor - what an ordeal.<br/><br/>Peter
      Judge has practically finished the designs for the charts which are excellent,
      I think. Now they have to be printed and engraved and assembled.

      that you have worked for 5 hours already (in your letter of 13th) and I do hope
      that you have had the opportunity to continue work on The Flight.  I am glad
