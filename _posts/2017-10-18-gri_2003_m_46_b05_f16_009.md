      2    "Dido, as there is a ship with a patriotic
      verse below on onejug, a verse begun,
      my "Remember Me" on the other--
      and a cup with "Faith" on her head.
      I don't suppose you like the title, but
      I don't see why I shouldn't have my
      "Private Bathly"!
      Thank you for getting my paintings.
      I do hope that you will have opportun-
      ities for improvising your finances soon--
      it is so worrying for you always, swing
      so precariously, and I'm afraid you don't eat enough.
      I am most jealous of Mr. A. Hill
      having tea with you when your hair
      is newly glorious from Ted's creative hand!
      Alack a day!
      I hope your 18th paintings was well
      attended.  I shall be interested and
      favorite titles, and whether you will
      be enough "draw" yourself to
      bring people to bos popular subjects
      for I feel that you will widen their
      interests!  Have you assauged some
      more lectures as Le Roux SLR (!)
