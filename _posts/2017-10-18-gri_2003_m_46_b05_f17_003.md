      Dearest Lawrence,
      I sent you a telegram this morning for you should, if you can meet the Woods on Monday at 6 at Roses before going to the Sex Lecture. I think I wrote to you all about it a week ago, a letter which I think you did not answer. I shall not come on Monday as I see that unless I am very careful I shall not have any money for my show - I don't know, as it is, how I can possibly make it up. However I must try to cut down more on frills such as chocolate biscuits, caskes etc. It can't be said I spend any money on 'bus fares as the Woods kindly do my shopping for me when they go into Hastings. I will come in a week's time - if that suits you

      less I am very careful I shall not

      know, as it is, how I can possibly

      down a nose on frills such as
      chocolate biscuits calico etc.  It can't
      be said I spend any money on
      bus fares as the Woods kindlly do
      my shopping for me when they go in

      Pett     3.5.52
      Dearest Lawrence,
      I sent you a telegram this morning for you should, if you can meet the Woods on Monday at 5 at Roses before going to the sex lecture. I think I wrote to you all about it a week ago, a letter which I think you did not answer. I shall not come on Monday as I see that unless I am very careful I shall not have any money for my show. I don't know, as it is, how I can possibly make it up. However I must try to cut down more on frills such as chocolate biscuits cakes, etc. It can't be said I spend any money on 'bus fares as the Woods kindly do my shopping for me when they go to Hastings. I will come in a week's time-if that suits you
