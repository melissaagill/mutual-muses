      Dearest Sylvia
      I miss you very much. Thank you very much indeed for a wonderful time in the country. I do hope I shall see you again there shortly. You certainly owe it to me in time: tell M that I have demanded some of my back time. I hope that you will be able to paint this afternoon- it is sunny & dry in London, tho' there was a night of storm. I do think that your new watercolour is an important one. Oh dearest Sylvia - how I admire your art: do go to Mrs. Hake this week for 'her' view. You will please her, yourself, & me. You will be glad to hear that I have missed no lectures: the post was only friendly or informative (17 letters in all). Atlas was among them. I will send you copies tomorrow. I think it looks rather well. This morning I went to Ted & then to the Tate Gallery; it included the original Pequet or Virtue in Danger from Buffalo, US. I have found in the library a M.L.A. book about [unclear]England[/unclear] C18th novels which should be very interesting.
      I'm afraid this letter is a bit chaotic but post offices are not the best places to write in.
      How I look forward to seeing you & the Woods next week. I love you, I cannot possibly live without you
      Lawrence

      & me. You will be glad to hear that I missed no lectures : the post was only
      friendly or informative ( 17 letters in all ). A thesis  was among them. I will
      send you copies tomorrow. I think it looks rather well. This morning I went
      to Ted & then to the Tate gallery : it includes the original Piquet or Virtue
      in Danger form Buffalo, U.S. I have found in the library a M.L.A. book about  English  C18th
      novels which should be very interesting.<br/>I''m afraid this letter is a bit
      chaotic but post offices are not the best places to write in.<br/>How I look
      forward to seeing you & the Woods next week. I love you, I cannot possibly live
      without you <br/>                    Lawrence'
