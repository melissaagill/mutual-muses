      Rectory Lodge
      Dearest Lawrence,
      Thank you so much for your letters
      and enclosures.  I'm sorry you don't
      advise me as to which photograph!
      However I shall have 4 enlarged
      and see which looks best and send
      that!  You shall have which ever you
      like--or all if you like--or one
      or other enlarged.
      I am most grateful to you for
      typing the letter.  I think "Homes and
      Gardens an excellent idea.  I will
      think out a suitable letter for them.
      Or could you?  with regard to Gain-
      sborough would it not be a good idea
      to phone him to see if he's back. and
      if he is to take the little painting
      along?  There may still be a chance
      though time is running out.  On Miss
      Campbell's advice I smoothed the contour
      of the face as she declares mine a perfect
      oval!  and put some Warner colour in
      the hair.  I also oiled it!
      Also would you  be so kind as to
