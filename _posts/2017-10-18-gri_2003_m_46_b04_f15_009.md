      up [unclear]Chulk [/unclear] hill- it was a mar-
      vellous day  - larks and
      goldfinches, bull finches,  linnets and pew wits we saw, all
      singing calling and disporting
      themselves in the sunshine.
         Michael tells me that it would
      be  wasted effort to send in
      "Lake Nemi" as the usual
      water-colour paintings are
      half-imperial for the R.A.  Perhaps
      I shall send in another oil instead.
