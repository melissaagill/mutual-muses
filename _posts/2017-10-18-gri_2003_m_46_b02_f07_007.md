      tapestries (pure mannerism) that they are 'gull of movement', 'full of imagery', (specifying neither) and that they anticipate the Baroque by a hundred or a hundred and fifty years.  (That puts the date of Baroque art at some years after Rubens' death or, even, at the start of the 18th century...).  He dismisses 'mere reason' (the phrase is his) as an encumbrance to appreciation.  Historical knowledge, he says, useless.  Certainly, his own is useless.

      Eleven o'clock has just chimed.  I wonder if you are thinking of me.  We used to at this time.  My aggressive feeling towards Pearce as a lecturer is banished quite, to be replaced by a desire for you, a longing to see you.  I visualize you so clearly.  I place you in possible landscapes or room at Pett.  I imagine you, here, too.  Especially here, among your pictures.

      Before getting down to work I must go and shop.  I will post this so as to catch the second collection.  I'm afraid my letter before this one was posted late yesterday so you may not have it while I write this.

      I adore you, my rose, my Venus, for now that Goddess has your features implanted in imagination by your splendid picture of her.

      I love you - Lawrence

      to be replaced by a desire for you, a longing to see you. I visualize you so
