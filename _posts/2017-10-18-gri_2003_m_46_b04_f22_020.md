      I do hope your cold is quite
      well again now and that your
      stay in Cambridge was successful and
      pleasent; and that you now have
      all my letters - I do hope you have

      they are not always immediately
      appreciated; except by the naive!
      I like your "Lament Imperial"
      it is delightfully outrageous!
      I am very interested in the film
      articles and hope to hear them soon.
      When are you going to show the book
      to Hodden?  Have you any news
      of Hogarth?
      I had a nice little note from
      Carol this morning - I shall reply
