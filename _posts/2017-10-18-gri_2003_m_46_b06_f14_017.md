      Pett P.S. I don't think I 8.2.53
      shall be going to Cambridge
      on Thursday but hope it is
      convenient for me to stay
      with you S. S.
      Dearest Lawrence,
      I have been framing since [unclear]after[/unclear]
      lunch - I still stay in bed till then,
      but I think tomorrow I shall get
      up a little earlier. I have done 4
      water-colours - the copper beech,
      the Red Lion, the Vale, and the
      Silver birch on Hampstead Heath.
      You must tell me when you want work
      for Banstead and I will give you the
      things I am not sending to Kensington.
      Please will you give me the measurements
      of "Tiny Tots" as I think I have a much
      nicer frame that fits it. I shall bring
      it when I come to fetch the others which
      I intend to do with [unclear]Mr[/unclear] Salter on the
      19th though I can't take them all as
      they are not all ready but I can
      take some and the large one in particular.
      I hope I shall remember to enclose
      Mr Pengilly's letter - it will give
      you the address and telephone number

      8-2-53 Pett Dearest Lawrence
      P.S. I don't think I
      shall be going to Cambridge
      on Thursday but hope it is
      convenient for me to stay
      with you. S.S.

      I have been framing since after
      lunch - I still stay in bed till then,
      but I think to-morrow I shall get
      up a little earlier. I have done 4
      water-ciolours - the Copper Beach,
      the Red Lion, the Vale, and the
      silver [unclear][/unclear] on Hampstead Heath.
      You must tell me when you want work
      for Banstead and I will give you the
      things I am not sending to Kensinton.
      Please will you give me the measurement
      of "Tiny Tot", as I think I have a much
      nicer frame that fits it. I shall bring
      it when I come to fetch the others witch
      I intend to do with Mrs Salter on the
      19th, though I can't take them all as
      they are not all ready but I can
      take some and the large one inparticular.
      I hope I shall remember to enclose
      Mr Pengilly's letter - it will give
      you the address and telephone number
