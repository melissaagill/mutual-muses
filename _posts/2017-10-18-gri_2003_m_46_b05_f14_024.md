      3. I will bring 12 eggs and some
      homemade butter - and I think meat
      with me - it is so cold I think
      that would be quite safe.
      Wednesday Having recieved your letter, I hasten
      to post this - I wondered if
      you had any money! If you
      would prefer it I will come by the
      morning bus, say which you think
      best. Please let me know at once!
      Thank you so much for making the
      appointments, Monday will be Hell!
      but I will get it over in a swoop!
      I'm so glad you lecture went well -
      it sounds very good.
      What can Dandy's secret by -
      not like [unclear][/unclear] I trust!
      I hope to see you, my adored
      Lion - I love you
      Sylvia
