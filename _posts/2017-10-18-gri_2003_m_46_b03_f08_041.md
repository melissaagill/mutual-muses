      Talking of books my parents are giving me a study of Symbolist Aesthetics in France ( which I have just bought but, like a good lion, not yet read). Last night with Mother &  rather dull people I went to a service " Touch & Go" & afterwards to an elaborate dinner ending with peaches served in flaming brandy ( it began, the dinner I mean, with Pimms No 1 for me) ! The service contained an amusing skit of sentimental songs about men: "I looked under a log-Ah!-there was BEN". My parents are dining & wining me on Sunday.
      I adore you, my beautiful painter, and long to see you painting again. I love you & long - too - to embrace you again. I am distressed to hear you are poorly sleeping & unwell: I shall put that to rights. I love you so much - who occupy my dreams and my daylight thoughts
      I love you

      Talking of books my parents are giving me a study of Symbolist Aesthetics in France (which I have just bought but, like a good liar, not yet read).  Last night with Mother & 2 rather dull people I went to a reverie "touch & Go".  I often wander to an elaborate dinner ending with peaches served in flaming brandy (it began, the dinner I mean, with [unclear]Pims[/unclear]  NO! for me)!  The reverie contained an amusing skit of sentimental songs about men = "I looked under a lon --Ah!--there was BEN".  My parents are dining & wining me on Sunday.
      I adore you, my beautiful painter, and long to see you painting again.  I love you & long - too - to embrace you again.  I am distressed to hear you are poorly sleeping & unwell:  I shall put that to rights.  I love you so much - who occupy my dreams and my daylight thoughts
      I love you
      Lawrence
