      Wimbledon
      Saturday
      My dearest Sylvia
      I reached Wimbledon in good time
      (pork chop for lunch) and am on my
      way to Paddington.  I do hope you
      found a convenient train that was
      not crowded; and that you found  a nice
      place for lunch.  Have a plea-
      sant weekend, and remember when
      you are at Pett that I do love
      you--that I love you very much,
      and only you, my beauty.  This
      really is written in haste--so
      goodbye for now, with all my love.
      I love you
      Lawrence
