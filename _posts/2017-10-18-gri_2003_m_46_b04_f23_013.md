      5  at a hotel so she (Tiny) will not have to go.
      Thank you for your poems.  I am
      so happy to have them.  They
      are most pleasing and deliciously
      ingenious.  I do enjoy them.
      I read them to Tiny too, who
      thought them very good.  I love
      you so much.  I long for you too
      and can hardly wait to the
      6th, however I shall work
      hard at painting and dressmaking
      so that I have plenty to show
      you when you come.
      Do tell me whether you "includ-
      ed [unclear][/unclear]or jumped to
      Wyndham Lewis"!
      I hope your father is well
      again now.
      I love you, and adore you
      my sweetheart.  My Laureate.
      How I long to see you again.
      I love you
      Sylvie
