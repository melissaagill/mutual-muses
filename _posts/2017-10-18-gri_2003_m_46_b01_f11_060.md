      27th December, 1948 11 Mansel Road Wimbledon
      Dearest Sylvia,
      Many thanks for your letters - the last of which ar-
      rived on Christmas day - which pleased me very much.
      I have not much time to write now as this morning I
      have to arrange a treasure hunt with Deirdre, go to
      tea with Dr Antal, and then rush back to Wimbledon for
      a tedious party. But I want to send you my love and
      a poem which I managed to scribble down between tire-
      some games and the like.
      I saw three ships come sailing in:
      One, scarred with frozen spume,
      Bore a glass rose only love could win
      To colour and perfume.
      The second, from the tropic South,
      Had monkeys in the rigging,
      In the hold was fruit for lovers' mouths
      For which Kings were begging.
      The third ship brought my love to me,
      The sails reared like a phoenix,
      My love came llandward from the sea,
      An admiral from a chrysalis.
      I think it is a good idea to go early to Stafford
      and I will write off to the librarian who arranges the
      exhibition details for more accommodation. I hope
      to see Blackheath early in the New Year. By the way,

      then rush back to Wimbledon for a tedious party.  But I want to send you my
      love and a poem which I managed to scribble down between tiresome games and
      the like. \n\nI saw three ships come sailing in: \nOne, scarred with frozen
      spume, \nBore a glass rose only love could win\nTo colour and perfume. \n\nThe
      second, from the tropic South, \nHad moneys in the rigging, \nIn the hold was
      fruit for lovers' mouths\nFor which Kinds were begging. \n\nThe Third ship brought
      my love to me, \nThe sails reared like a Phoenix, \nMy love came landward from
      the sea, \nAn admiral from a chrysalis. \n\nI think it is a good idea to go
      early to Stafford and I will write off to the Librarian who arranges the exhibition
      details for more accommodation. I hope to see Blackheath early in the New Year.
      By the way, shall we stay a night in Birmingham - to give us more time for the
      Wilsons, &c?"

    clean_transcription: '27th December, 1948<br/>11 Mansel Road  Wimbledon<br/><br/>Dearest
      Sylvia, <br/>Many thanks for your letters - the last of which arrived on Christmas
      day - which pleased me very much. I have not much time to write now as this
      morning I have to arrange a treasure hunt with Deirdre, go to tea with Dr Antal,
      and then rush back to Wimbledon for a tedious party.  But I want to send you
      my love and a poem which I managed to scribble down between tiresome games and
      the like. <br/><br/>I saw three ships come sailing in: <br/>One, scarred with
      frozen spume, <br/>Bore a glass rose only love could win<br/>To colour and perfume.
      <br/><br/>The second, from the tropic South, <br/>Had moneys in the rigging,
      <br/>In the hold was fruit for lovers'' mouths<br/>For which Kinds were begging.
      <br/><br/>The Third ship brought my love to me, <br/>The sails reared like a
      Phoenix, <br/>My love came landward from the sea, <br/>An admiral from a chrysalis.
      <br/><br/>I think it is a good idea to go early to Stafford and I will write
      off to the Librarian who arranges the exhibition details for more accommodation.
      I hope to see Blackheath early in the New Year. By the way, shall we stay a
      night in Birmingham - to give us more time for the Wilsons, &c?'
