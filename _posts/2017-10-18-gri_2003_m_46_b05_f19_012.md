      Dearest Lawrence,
      I shall be going to Ditchling on
      the 15th (Friday) and I will come
      to town on the 16th, Saturday.  Could
      you be so kind as to find me a
      nice train from Hayward Heath
      in the latish afternoon--say about
      5 o'clocl--or if this is not con-
      venient suggest another time.
      I don't think I had better go
      too early on Saturday.  I will
      be lovely to see you.  I haven't
      heard from Aunt Margaret yet.
      I expect I shall hear on Monday.
      It has been impossible to paint
      out of doors so I have been doing
      housework and washing, and
      tying up the tomatoes--it was rather
