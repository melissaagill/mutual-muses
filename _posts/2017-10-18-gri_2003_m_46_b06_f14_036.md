      You have made me much easier
      by your encouragement and the
      good news of all the people you
      are writing to.
      I hope you get some Mexican
      Lectures. I will bring you 1 on
      Thursday! I suppose you have some-
      thing of mine you can take to Barn-
      stead Art Group.
      You seem to be brimming with
      ideas - it must be the Spring!
      Thank you so much for the
      poems - I have read them only once
      but they seem most exciting - I
      was doing cards hard ever since
      they came - I shall have time

      to watch me working and bring in

      to.<br/><br/>   I hope you get some Mexican Lectures. I will bring you 1 on
      Thursday! I suppose you have some-thing of mine you can take to Bans-tead Art
      Group. <br/><br/>   You seem to be brimming with ideas - it must be the Spring!<br/><br/>   Thank
      you so much for the poems - I have read them only once but they seem most exciting
      - I was doing cards hard ever since they came - I shall have time now I hope<br/><br/>   Beryl
      is coming this afternoon to watch me working and bringing her 15 year old nephew.
      It will be nice to see her.
