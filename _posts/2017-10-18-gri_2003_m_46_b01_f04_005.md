      No, there is some more prose to come. I think I ought to add that Greek temples faced East. I expect you know but it is an important allusion. And I hasten to add that only for the purposes of this poem does the poet equate mythology with superstition and both of them with night.

      A NARRATIVE OF OWLS

      A black owl flew
      From the sea most blue
      To London Town
      Where he settled down
      In saint James' park
      Just before it stopped being dark

      A white owl who
      Had crossed the sea too
      Got there earlier
      And was fast asleep
      His feathers were curlier
      But he wasn't so deep

      Another white own
      Played about on the way
      And when it was day
      Had to hide in the owl
      Of a monk named Dunch
      Who ate him for lunch

      A blue own made
      The trip by cloud
      And was dismayed
      To find so little luggage allowed
      That he could not bring
      A change of wing

      A grey owl went to see
      The National Gallery
      But fell in love with a lion
      And wouldn't fly on
      He's still there only
      He's getting lonely

      But one night soon
      By the light of the moon
      These owls will set
      A course for Pett
      For East or West
      The nest
      Is best
      And its nearly Soon.

      All love
      Lawrence
