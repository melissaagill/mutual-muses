      Are you finding time to paint, sweetheart? Do tell me what you are working on.

      I have written same more about The Bad & the Beautiful. Otherwise I have been a little idle.

      Correction: there is something new about my past. Apparently Father as well as Mother used to judge and punish me unreasonably: I was ruled by 2 distinct standards, what bothered mother and what bothered father. Each tolerated or encouraged what the other disliked in my conduct.

      The sun is getting warmer. Connie suggests the Pump Room for coffee during shopping so I shall be there about 11.00 - at which time I still think of you, my love, my beauty.

      I love and adore you so
      love you

      Otherwise I have been a little idle. <br/>Correction: there is something new
      about my past. Apparently Father as well as Mother need to judge and punish
      me unbearably: I was ruled by two distinct standards, what bothered mother and
      what bothered father. Each tolerated or encouraged what the other disliked in
      my conduct. <br/>The sun is getting warmer. Connie suggests the Pump Room for
      coffee during shopping so I shall be there about 11.00 - at which time I still
      think of you my love, my beauty.<br/><br/>I love and adore you so.<br/><br/>Love
      you<br/>Lawrence'
