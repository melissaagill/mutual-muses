      Dearest Sylvia
      Thank you for your two letters. One I received last night, the other this morning. You see, I did go to Brighton after all, first spending the night of Saturday with Molly & Eric, and so your letter did not reach until my return. I hasten to answer it before you leave Bath.
      Your account of Chicester cathedral, where I have been twice, but not recently enough to have a good memory of it, stimulated me to add almost 50 more lines to my typographical poem. The Countess of Arundel I particularly mention but the whole section about church visiting followed the communication of my Muse. I will not send it to you, yet, much as I am tempted to do so, but prefer you to see the whole poem when it is complete. (Apart from this poem I am working on The Poet in the Garden, along question and answer poem (100 lines), a journey based on the fare-stages of a bus ticket, and plan today to start a group of lyrics about women with double-heads and '[unclear]profullface[/unclear]' faces.)
      On Friday I talked about near Mannerists & mannerism: Piero's (?) Florentine General, two del Sartos, the new Bronzino, two Moronis, Iatto's Lucretia, and Sebastiano del Piombo: it was successful, I believe, and certainly covered an unfamiliar sequence of pictures. I thought of you so hard, so sweetly.
      I thought of you, again, at Brighton. Ilsa Rodmell is a sophisticated, primitive painter working now on charming Campigli - [unclear]douanier[/unclear] Rous-seau type pictures. Bernard and I were both impressed. She is very gay, CIRCA 50, and lives, incidentally in pretty Russell Square. She has a 26 year-old lover who is really a superb painter, John Catt (so there are two painting cats connected with Brighton), an expressionist, as neurotic as they come, but very gifted. So we had a pictorial treat for Ilsa & he seemed to have hundred of pictures each to show us.
      Ilso has a husband, absolutely un-remarkable & dull, as well as John

      about church visiting\nfollowed the communication of my Muse. I will not send
      it to you , yet,\nmuch as I am tempted to do so, but prefer you to see the whole
      poem when\nit is complete. (Apart from this poem I am working on The Poet in
      the\nGarden, a long question and answer poem (100 lines), a journey based on\nthe
      fare-stages of a bus-ticket, and plan today to start a group of\nlyrics about
      women with double-heads and [unclear]'profullface'[/unclear] faces.)\nOn Friday
      I talked about [unclear]near[/unclear]  mannerists to mannerism: Pienos (?)\nFlorentine
      general, two del Santos, the new Bronzino, two Manonis, Catto's\nLucretia and
      Sebastiano del Piombo: it was successful, I believe, and\ncertainly covered
      an unfamiliar sequence of pictures. I thought of you\nso hard, so sweetly.\nI
      thought of you, again, at Brighton. Ilsa Rodmell is a sophisticated,\nprimitive
      painter working now on charming Campigli - douanier Rous-\nseau type pictures.
      Bernard and I were both impressed. She is very\ngay, circa 50, and lives, incidentally,
      in pretty Russell Square. She\nhas a 26 year-old lover who is really a superb
      painter, John Catt (so\nthere are two painting cats connected with Brighton),
      an expressionist,\nas neurotic as they come, but very gifted. So we had a pictorial\ntreat
      for Ilsa & he seemed to have hundreds of pictures each to\nshow us. \nIlsa has
      a husband, absolutely un-memorable & dull, as well as John\n\n\n\n\n"
