      Dearest Sylvia,

      How kind of you to send me the [unclear]Mevatti[/unclear] article, I look forward to reading it later today.  This is your birthday: what are you doing now?  wish that I knew.  I am going shopping with Connie and I expect to sit in the garden after lunch.  Oh if you were only here - or I was at Pett.

      I missed you yesterday at Cheltenham, for we should have adored it together.  Connie does very well I must say: we saw almost everything of interest in the day - of architectural  and shopping interest.  She must have been exhausted (I was).  It was rather like being at Brighton (and that reminded me of you again).  I saw Pittmill's Pump Room - dilapidated but the dome is being repaired, I'm glad to say.  I have some literature on the town which I shall have great pleasure in showing you soon.

      Even as I write this letter Connie is giving me hair raising stories about [unclear]Matle[/unclear] and my childhood.  Nothing actually new but more  and nasty detail accumulates about the attitudes we knew.

      Dearest Sylvia:
      How kind of you to send me the Menatti article.
      I look forward to reading it later today. This
      is your birthday: what are you doing now?
      Wish that I knew. I am going shopping with Con-
      vie and I expect to sit in the garden after lunch.
      Oh, if you were only here - or I was at Pett.

      I missed you yesterday at Cheltenlam, for
      we should have ordered it together. Connie
      does very well I must say: we saw almost
      everything of interest in the day - of archi-
      tectural and shopping interest. She must have
      been exhausted, (I was). It was rather like
      being at Brighton, (and that reminded me
      of you again). I saw Pittville Pump
      room - delapidated but the dome is being
      repaired, I'm glad to say. I have some lit-
      erature on the town which I shall have
      great pleasure in showing you soon.

      Even as I write this letter, Connie is
      giving me hair-raising stories about
      Mother and my child hood. Nothing actually
      new but more and nasty detail accum-
      ulates about the attitudes we knew.

      Dearest Sylvia:
      How kind of you to send me the [unclear]nerotti[/unclear] article. I look forward to reading it later today. This is your birthday: what are you doing now? Wish that I knew. I am going shopping with Connie and I expect to sit in the garden after lunch. Oh if only you were here - or I was at Pett.
      I missed you yesterday at Cheltenham for we should have [unclear]ordered[/unclear] it together. Connie does very well I must say: we saw almost everything of interest in the day - of architectural and shopping interest. She must have been exhausted (I was). It was rather like being at Brighton (and that reminded me of you again). I saw Pitt Mills pump room - dilapidated but the dome is being repaired, I'm glad to say. I have some literature on the town which I shall have great pleasure in showing you soon.
      Even as I write this letter Connie is giving me hair-raising stories about Mother and my childhood. Nothing overall new but more and nasty detail accumulates about the attitudes we knew.
