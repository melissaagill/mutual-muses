      8 iv 1951  Blackheath  Dearest Sylvia,
      Thank you for your sweet letter which contained such good news
      about Carol's portrait.  Speaking of portraits I think the wind
      blowing my trousers makes me look a little like a cowboy in Carol's
      photograph but the top part is rather better.  I am writing to
      thank her for sending it, as you recommended.

      Will you book on the coach that is coming on Satureday afternoon?
      I have an N.G. lecture at 2:30, which will be over at 3:30:  so I
      can easily meet the bus at Lewisham.  I long to see you.  Hetty
      has swooned with excitement now that a date is actually fixed.
      I wish that I could come down to Pett today as M will not be there
      but, alas, that cannot be.  Yawolla has set off, just this minute,
      hearing you were alone, but I don't suppose, even running, he'll
      get there till tomorrow.

      I am very pleased indeed about Flugel wanting an article from Clif-
      ford.  I shall congratulate him tomorrow.

      Here are one or two poems for you, my dearest creature, my muse,
      written in the feeling of excitement that we shall meet again soon.

      IDEAL OF A HOLIDAY

      A slow boat for the staging of a noh-play
      Idling via the ottomans of sunset.
      Islands delay the mantlepiece horizon.
      I'd love to get you on a slow boat to China
      Though there's nothing in China to equal you.
      Wake slowly, retarded by the occident.
      Slowly the wake uncoils, detumescently,
      On water dark and tangled as an octupus.
      The moon rolls like a tear along the sheets.
      The sea is honey and the boat our spoon.

      AGAINST PARADOXES
      Should paradoxes on the lips
      Of a lover - take myself,
      (Who has loved except ourselves?)
      Grow like roses out of season,
      Like a mansion on an iceburg?
      Does not the wit of images
      Betray ambivalence?

      But, my love, and only love,
      Opposing images are idle
      In the usage of our love.
      Your roses do not tilt the season

      Blackheath 8 iv 1951

      Dearest Sylvia,

      Thank you for your sweet letter which contained such good news about Carol's portrait. Speaking of portraits I think the wind blowing my trousers makes me look a little like a cowboy in Carol's photograph but the top part is rather better. I am writing to thank her for sending it, as you recommended.

      Will you book on the coach that is coming on Saturday afternoon? I have an N.G. lecture at 2.30, which will be over at 3.30: so I can easily meet the bus at Lewisham. I long to see you. Hetty has swooned with excitement now that a date is actually fixed. I wish that I could come down to Pett today as M will not be there but, alas, that cannot be. Yawolla has set off, just this minute, hearing you were alone, but I don't suppose, even running, he'll get there till tomorrow.

      I am very pleased indeed about Flugel wanting an article from Clifford. I shall congratulate him tomorrow.

      Here are one or two poems for you, my dearest creature, my muse, written in the feeling of excitement that we shall meet again soon.

      IDEA OF A HOLIDAY
      A slow boat for the staging of a noh-play
      Idling via the ottomans of sunset.
      Islands delay the mantelpiece horizon.
      I'd love to get you on a slow boat to China
      Though there's nothing in China to equal you.
      Wake slowly, retarded by the occident.
      Slowly the wake uncoils, detumescently,
      On water dark and tangled as an octopus.
      The moon rolls like a tear upon the sheets.
      The sea is honey and the boat our spoon.

      AGAINST PARADOXES
      Should paradoxes on the lips
      Of a lover - take myself,
      (Who has loved except ourselves?)
      Grow like roses out of season,
      Like a mansion on an iceburg?
      Does not the wit of images
      Betray ambivalence?

      But my love, and only love,
      Opposing images are idle
      In the usage of our love.
      Your roses do not tilt the season
