    annotation_text: '(5-6-48) 11 mansel road Wimbledon SATURDAY My dearest Sylvia:
      Alas, that your dream about me should be anxious one and, since I participated,
      I feel most guilty. I hope it will not be repeated. I know how unpleasant it
      is to wake up after such dreams and feel unhappy - the feeling carried over
      from the dream and not dispelled by consciousness as it should be. How I wish
      our nights were spent together for I could then wake and put my dreams into
      effect at once for I will admit to you, Sylvia, that my dreams are frequently
      about you but that (to put it in the most sober terms) there is no frustration
      until I actually wake up. I purred happily trough your letter it was a concerned
      purr at your distressing dream. I received a letter from Gibson at the same
      time in which he says he well put my name on the list of occasional lecturers
      and that the fee has been raised to a pound. He has an amazing signature, about
      the size of a fly, though narrower than a fly. With rare clarity I imagine you
      in the Reference library with the delicious world of Carpaccio open before you.
      As you said to me not long ago I would now say to you ; ''You will be terribly
      learned''. Daily I imagine you, most often, I think, at Pett where we have been
      so happy together and shortly are to be again. I see your picture above my bed
      and remember how you lay by the sundial on your front and bent your legs in
      the air and the skin crinkled at the back of your knees. Your lovely legs...
      And you say you have almost completed a drawing. I am so pleased. I [unclear]ints[/unclear]
      turn it reminds me of you drawing me in the evening at Pett and I recapture
      the ease and pleasure. Do not forget my rose if there is time for roses will
      not be here much longer. Poor Paul, that is - Peter, is in a bad state. Completely
      broke, separated (for the moment) from his lover, out of a job, and prevented
      from taking the only job that was offered him by a hernia which may or may not
      go down. The rent is due tomorrow and the milk-bill was due yesterday. I have
      spent much of yesterday and today with him an have caught a slight touch of
      his depression.'

      11 mantel road wimbledon
      saturday

      My dearest Sylvia:

      Alas, that your dream about me should be an anxious
      one and, since I participated, I feel most guilty. I
      hope it will not be repeated. I know how unpleasant
      it is to wake up after such dreams and feel unhappy -
      the feeling carried over from the dream and not dispel-
      led by consciousness as it should be. How I wish our
      nights were spent together for I could then wake and put
      my dream into effect at once for I will admit to you,
      Sylvia, that my dreams are frequently about you but that
      (to put it in the most sober terms) there is no frust-
      ration until I actually wake up.

      I purred happily through your letter though it was
      a concerned purr at your distressing dream. I receiv-
      ed a letter from Gibson at the same time in which he
      says he will put my name on the list of occasional lec-
      turers and that the fee has been raised to a pound. He
      has an amazing signature, about the size of a fly, though
      narrower than any fly.

      With rare clarity I imagine you in the Reference Lib-
      rary with the delicious world of Carpaccic open before
      you. As you said to me not long ago I would say now
      to you; 'You will be terribly learned'.

      Daily I imagine you, most often, I think, at Pett
      where we have been so happy together and shortly are to
      be again. I see your picture above my bed and remember
      how you lay by the sundial on our front and bent your
      legs in the air and the skin crinkled at the back of your
      knees. Your lovely legs... And you ay you have al-
      most completed a drawing. I am so pleased. In its
      turn it reminds me of you drawing me in the evening at
      Pett and I recapture the ease and pleasure. Do not for-
      get my rose if there is time for roses will not be here much longer.

      Poor Paul, that is - Peter, is in a bad state. Com-
      pletely broke, separated (for the moment) from his lover,
      out of a job, and prevented from taking the only job that
      was offered him by a hernia which may or may not go down.
      The rent is due tomorrow and the milk-bill was due yester-
      day. I have spent much of yesterday and today with him
      and have caught a slight touch of his depression.

      I participated, I feel most guilty. I hope it will not be repeated. I know how
      unpleasant it is to wake up after such dreams and feel unhappy - the feeling
      carried over from the dream and not dispelled by consciousness as it should
      be. How I wish our nights were spent together for I could then wake and put
      my dream into effect at once for I will admit to you, Sylvia, that my dreams
      are frequently about you but that (to put it in the most sober terms) there
      is no frustration until I actually wake up.\n\nI purred happily through your
      letter through it was a concerned purr at your distressing dream. I received
      a letter from Gibson at the same time in which he says he will put may name
      on the list of occasional lecturers and that the fee has been raised to a pound.
      He has an amazing signature, about the size of a fly, though narrower than any
      fly.\n\nWith rare clarity I imagine you in the Reference Library with the delicious
      world of Carpaccio open before you. As you said to me not long ago I would say
      now to you; 'You will be terribly learned'. \n\nDaily I imagine you, most often,
      I think, at Pett where we have been so happy together and shortly are to be
      again. I see your picture above my bed and remember how you lay be the sundial
      on your front and bent your legs in the air and the skin crinkled at the back
      of your knees. Your lovely legs... And you say you have almost completed a drawing.
      I am so pleased. In its turn it reminds me of your drawing me in the evening
      at Pett and I recapture the ease and pleasure. Do not forget my rose if there
      is time for roses will not be here much longer.\n\nPoor Paul, that is - Peter,
      is in a bad state. Completely broke, separated (for the moment) from his lover
      out of a job, and prevented from taking the only job that was offered him by
      a hernia which may or may not go down. The rent is due tomorrow and the milk-bill
      was due yesterday. I have spent much of yesterday and today with him and have
      caught a slight touch of his depression."
