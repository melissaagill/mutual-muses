      Monday 22-6-53
      Dearest Sylvia,
      I do hope that you enjoyed your weekend with the greenwoods. Not only Piers Plowman but a fais as well; it sounds delightful. I hope John G. was in good spirits.
      Darling I should adore to come to Wales and povided only that you can afford it I will indeed come. Thank you so much for the wonderful idea. I shall have to come on 7th [unclear]tomoror[/unclear] - or else late on the 6th - assuming the afternoon goes well.
      So glad the Woods are nice.
      The W.I. sounds "lot of fun". ( I remember I was ecpected to judge flowers after a lecture, once.)
      American in Paris was very enjoyable. There was a vallet [unclear]illdevor[/unclear] based on [unclear]Utullo[/unclear], Toulouse - lanier, % Henri Rousseau - and ( I think) Berman. I had to stand through most of it with an umbrella & an awfull of [unclear]roaks[/unclear] unfortunately.
      This week is rather busy with lectures, pullie and school ones. I got quite a lot of work done on the weekend and started an article (a chapter) on the late wor of ginger Rogers, Claudette Calhent, Ruth Hussey, Barbara Stanwyck, Bette Davis - cfd. with the new generation of actresses.

      [22-6-53] Monday Dearest Sylvia
      I do hope you enjoyed your weekend with the Green -
      woods. Not only Piers Plowman, but a fair as well: it
      sounds delightful. I hope John G. was in good spirits.

      Darling I should adore to come to Wales and provided
      only that you can afrord it, I will indeed come. Thank
      you so much for the wonderful idea. I shall have
      to come on 7th however - or else late on the 6th -
      assuming the afternoon goes well.

      So glad the Woods are nice.
      The W. I. sounds a lot of fun. (I remember I was ex-
      pected to judge flowers after a lecture, once.)

      American in Paris was very enjoyable. There was
      a ballet with decor based on Utullo, Toulaure-Lan-
      liec, & Henri Rousseau - and (I think) Berman. I
      had to stand through most of it with an umbrella &
      an armful of books unfortunately.

      This week is rather busy with lectures - public and
      school ones. I got quite a lot of work done over
      the weekend and started an article (or chapter)
      on the later work of Ginger Rogers, Claudette Cal-
      bert, Ruth Hussey, Barbara Stanwych, Bette
      Davis - ctd. with the new generation of actresses.
