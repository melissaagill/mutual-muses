      107 BLACKHEATH PARK,

      1st MARCH 1950

      Dearest Sylvia,

      How are you, my lover, my beauty, on
      the first day of the month that is the
      first month of Spring?

      I have been working and now I can relax
      and write to you before setting off to
      Banstead.

      My new chapter has reached about 5,
      000 words which is, perhaps, half-way.
      So you can see it is double the length
      of the other chapters.  I am pleased
      with my discoveries and long toilmpart
      them to you.

      Tonight at Banstead the subject is
      Expressionism and very conveniently there
      has been a small but thorough expression-
      ist show at S. George's gallery.  I shall
      not have a meeting there next Wednesday as
      you come on that day.  This Saturday I
      must take them to the Tate...

      Yesterday's lecture to the photographers
      was much better than the one you heard
      (Brueghel, el Greco, Velasques) and they
