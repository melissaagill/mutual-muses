      Pett 23.9.52
      Dearest Lawrence
      Thank you for your letter and delightful Dandy drawing! by the way may I remind you to bring Savages' New Yorkers?
      I hope you have your B lectures taped - I did not realise that you were so busy as Rayner Banham and Mrs. Cregan seem to be doing it all. I am most disappointed to hear that the Degas Exhibition is so disappointing. I must go and see the Brunswick trasure. I've been reading about them in the Burlington - they seem just my cup of tea.
      I see what you mean about "of fate" I expect you're right - I'll read it again.
      I did a little more to my still life yesterday - today
