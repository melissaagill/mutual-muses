      3 Sept 1951 Dearest Sylvia
      This morning I have prepared tomorrow's Turner lec-
      ture and am sitting on Blackheath station waiting
      for the train to town, where, at 6, my father & I are
      going to the South Bank. It is a warm sunny day though
      not without sudden chilly jabs of wind every
      now and again. I hope you are now spared the
      musical TINGS in the hall of the Rectory.

      The film man I met yesterday was useless but I
      have 2 more contacts yet to see, one film, one publi-
      city in general. Last night John & I were late &
      the Coopmans - with whom we lunched - to somebody
      else's feat. I cannot remember his name. Most
      of the time was spent listening - reluctantly but
      politely - to somebody else who's name I missed
      recording what can only be described as C. chapters
      of his novel. It is too sophisticated, he told us,
      for ordinary publishers - most of whom have re-
      jected it. Happily a bottle of Italian vermouth
      was at my elbow & my host sufficiently thought-
      ful to encourage me to refill my glass, more than
      once. Even so - I sometimes wonder why I bother
      to leave my books, my bed.

      I heard from somebody yesterday, that Sir
      Osbert is very unwell indeed - He rose from bed
      to visit Black Eyes & Lemonade recently, however.

      LATER
      As you perhaps gather from the handwriting
      the last paragraph above was written in the train. I
      am now in Lyons having tea, having just left the
      S.E.A. Miss Chick has offered me a lecture at
      Chelmsford on 5th Oct. Unfortunately she has

      Dearest Sylvia
      This morning I have prepared tomorrow's Turner lec-ture and am sitting on Blackleath station, waiting for the train to town where, at 6, my father & I are going to the South Bank. It is a warm sunny day its not without sudden chilly jabs of wind every now and again. I hope you are now spared the musical TINGS in the hall of the Rectory.

      The film man I met yesterday was useless but I have 2 more contacts yet to see, one films, one publi-city in general. Last night [unclear]Saln[/unclear] & I were late [unclear]&[/unclear] the [unclear]Cooperams[/unclear] - with whom we lunched - to somebody else's feat. I cannot remember his name. Most of the time was spent listening - reluctantly but politely - to somebody else who's name I missed recording what can only be described as 6 chapters of his novel. It is too sophisticated, he told us, for ordinary publishers - most of whom have re-jected it. Happilya bottle of Italian vermouth was at my elbow & my host sufficiently thought-ful to encourage me to refill my glass, more than once. Even so - I sometimes wonder why I bother to lecture my books, my lad.

      I heard from somebody yesterday, that Sis Orbert is very unwell indeed. He rose from bed to visit Black Eyes & Lemonade recently, however.
