      Sunday 8 November Blackheath Dearest Sylvia
      It was marvellous seeing you again on Wednesday and Friday,
      expecially on Friday when I was (to use a medical term) much
      more myself. I love you so much. I can't wait to hear that
      we can have 46. I hope South gets in touch with you soon.
      Seeing you again made my longing to be with you so fresh
      and strong. I hope your journey back was comfortable
      and that you met C. as you arranged to.

      I have got my Art News article off, after giving 2 lectures
      yesterday. Today I have had a big clean-up: with my
      articles I had accumulated piles of books and journals.
      It is down to one pile now - of books about the Le Corbusier -
      for tomorrow's lecture at Harperden.

      Tea with Pasmore today to discuss my Arch. Review article.
      I have no other news - except I feel better and a little more
      relaxed now. It made me so happy seeing you again.
      I love and adore you.

      I hope you find time for some painting. Let me know

      Sunday 8 November

      Dearest Sylvia

      It was marvellous seeing you again on Wednesday and Friday, especially on Friday when I was (to use a medical term) much more myself. I love you so much. I can't wait to hear that we can have 46. I hope South gets in touch with you soon. Seeing you again made my longing to be with you so fresh and strong. I hope your journey back was comfortable and that you met C. as you arranged to.

      I have got my Art News article off, after giving 2 lectures yesterday. Today I have had a big clean-up: with my articles I had accumulated pies of books and journals. It is down to one pile now - of books about Le Corbusier - for tomorrow's lecture at Harpenden.

      Tea with Pasmore today to discuss my Arch. Review article. I have no other news - except I feel better and a little more relaxed now. It made me so happy seeing you again. I love and adore you.

      I hope you find time for some painting. Let me know all you do. I love you and anticipate our future very happily.
                                      I love you
                                      Lawrence
