      Dearest Sylvia,

      I am so glad that you are getting on with your view from the church-yard: you must be very relieved as it nears completion after quite a long time.

      Your letter contains delightful observations of the country, though the actual import of your observations (autumn) is welcome to others than lions: however, I was delighted by your descriptions. You are my topographical cat.

      Further, you seem to be picking things madly: I visualise you as Ceres, splashed somewhat with different colored juices at the centre of a yielding pyramid of fruit.

      I still do not know about Brighton (I will this evening - one way or the other), but I do not think that I can come to visit you at Pett, much as I should like to. Sure, stay till the 19th anyway.

      Today I have to see the photographs newly made for the exhibition, attend the opening of the Children's Art exhibition, and lecture at 5.00 on Veronese. I am an industrious lion today.

      John McHale talked to Ithell Colquohoun the other day and she seemed to think there was a possibility of getting somebody to finance a magazine. Perhaps there is still a chance to publish one outrageous number of something.

      Blackheath  8 ix 50  Dearest Sylvia,

      I am so glad that you are getting on with your
      view from the church-yard: you must be very re-
      lieved as it nears completion after quite a long
      time.

      Your letter contains delightful observations
      of the country, though the actual import of your
      observations (autumn) is welcome to others than
      lions: however, I was delighted by your descript-
      ions.  You are my topographical cat.

      Further, you seem to be picking things madly:
      I visualise you as Ceres, splashed somewhat with
      different colored juices at the centre of a yield-
      ing pyramid of fruit.

      I still do not know about Brighton (I will this
      evening - one way or the other), but I do not think
      that I can come to visit you at Pett, much as I
      should like to.  Sure, stay till the 19th any-
      way.

      Today I have to see the photographs newly made
      for the exhibition, attend the opening of the Child-
      ren's Art exhibition, and lecture at 5:00 on Veron-
      ese.  I am an industrious lion today.

      John McHale talked to Ithell Colquohoun the
      other day and she seemed to think there was a pos-
      sibility of getting somebody of finance a magazine.
      Perhaps there is still a chance to publish one out-
      ragious number of something.

      Unfortunately Laughter in the Next Room is no
      longer available from Boots.  Good news, on the
      other hand, is that I have stopped the kiss of death
      Statesman and Observer and ordered the Burlington
