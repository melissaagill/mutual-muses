      11 OCTOBER 1951  Blackheath
      Dearest Sylvia
      My cold is getting better, I think.  I had a very good nights' sleep and I
      shall go not a step beyond the pillar-box today so I ought to be fit for
      Haverhill tomorrow.  Dandy muffled up posting his letters:

      This is his
      brown over-
      coat as an
      undershirt.

      High up the sun is bright and throws the shadow in the window-bars on my page
      as I write - ground level however is blurred with mist.  Such weather I also
      found at Cambridge so it may be general.  As it seems during the morning you
      may be able to finish your picture.  Or perhaps I am behind hard with the news
      and you have managed to complete it.

      I hope that we meet soon.  Poor lion is desperate to see you again.  Lion
      is in love.  You are always on my mind.  I take your locket with me when
      I am on my travels - what a sweet, precious token it is.

      Lion in Cambridge - about
      to retire - your locket
      to hand.

      It glows when I hold it in the sun.  It is my symbol of you, dearest love.

      Further than mist's rogue cage
      Past time tables of the season
      the village is a locket:
      I love faces of distances
      Between your head and my mouth.
