      The Bell Hotel
      ELY
      19 X 50
      Dearest Sylvia
      You will not be surprised to hear that I reached here without mishap (Yawolla being with you!) as I am sure you have anticipated my delight in the cathedral and in King's College which is attached to the cathedral. The lecture room is a hall in the gate-house and, originally, part of the monastry - delightful to lecture in. The splendid Gothic sections of the cathedral support my contention that in Gothic 'anything goes': the octagon is a[unclear]vanishing[/unclear]invention, more beautiful in [unclear]liven[/unclear]rhythyms, leading up through diminshing ribs and panels, than startling in dramatic chiaroscuro. There are four 'decorated' lights in the octagonal crossing anyway which provide plenty of light, belowthat lanterns. The tombs (including a chantry in which late Gothic & [unclear]Guileo Romano[/unclear] grotesque mingle) are, of course, interesting but they are repainted freshly - normally one is pleased to see this, as at Wells, - but the paint here is rather [unclear]worn[/unclear] and not crisp in effect. The Roundheads despoiled the Lady Chapel, beheading every figure in a complex series of legendary scenes from the virgin's life, but you'll be glad to hear that the monastic buildings, now the school, are being intelligently restored every holiday - stupid walls being removed & old archways opened, and so on. The Headmaster showed me round, explaining this part of the buildings. The Early English tiled floor of the School's Chapel has an Adam & Eve and a pelican guarded by lions. (Pelicans & Putto mingle in the Italianate chantry I mentioned above.) The Headmaster is hospitable & jolly and, though he uses lots of schoolboy slang, he is liberal and enlightened,

    annotation_text: The Pell Hotel  19 X 50 ELY  Dearest Sylvia You will not be surprised
      to hear that I reached here without mishap (Yawalla being with you!) and I am
      sure you have anticipated my delight in the cathedral and in King's College
      which is attached to the cathedral.  The lecture room is a hall in the gate-house
      and originally, part of the  monastery - delightful to lecture in.  The splendid
      Gothic sections of the cathedral support my contention that in Gothic 'anything
      goes'. the octagon is a vanishing invention, more beautiful in linear rhythms,
      leading up through diminishing ribs and panels, than startling in dramatic [unclear][/unclear].  There
      are four 'decorated' lights in the octagonal crossing anyway which provide plenty
      of light, below the lantern.  The tombs (including a chantry in which late Gothic
      & Guilio Romano grotesque mingle) are, of course, interesting but they are repainted
      freshly - normally one is pleased to see this as at Wells but the paint here
      is rather worn & not crisp in effect.  The Roundheads despoiled the Lady chapel,
      beheading every figure in a complex series of legendary scenes from the Virgin's
      life, but you'll be glad to hear that the monastic buildings, now the school
      are being intelligently restored every holiday - stupid walls being removed
      & old archways opened, and so on.  The Headmaster showed me round, explaining
      the part of the buildings.  The early English tiled floor at the school's chapel
      has an Adam & Eve and a pelican guarded by lions. (Pelican & putts mingle in
      the Italianate chantry I mentioned above.)  The Headmaster is hospitable & jolly
      and, though he uses lots of school boy slang, he is liberal and enlightened.
