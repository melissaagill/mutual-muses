      N.G. 24 III 1951
      Dearest Sylvia,
      I do hope that you have a pleasant Easter and I do hope that
      Spring, which is already encouraging exquisite pink blossoms
      here, will surround you with fresh and lovely colours. Will you
      be able to paint some of the blossoms at Pett which you so
      often have missed at this season in the past?
      I enclose some [unclear]fumage[/unclear] drawings (done with the aid of a cand-
      le) over which are lyrics dedicated to you. I hope the [unclear]compil[/unclear]-
      ation pleases you: I think it reather successful. Speaking of
      writing Orphee is at last written. I will send you a copy soon.
      Going over my notes I realised how much of it I owed to you.
      Indeed my own contribution is quite tiny compared with your es-
      sential perceptions. I know what Death's sacrifice is, by the
      way: my only discovery!
      It is my mother's birthday tomorrow and I shall spend the day
      there. A nice lot to drink will dispell the last of my cold. Inci-
      dentally I have just lectured without much difficulty so
      you will realise I am nearly well.
      Your two oils are now at the R.A. How good they are. I am sure
      that they must be admitted. They are coherent yet daring de-
      signs - divinely painted.
      Owing to some silly typographical slip my name in Art News is left off the [unclear]Braunes[/unclear]
      review : on the other hand it is dignified by exemption from the us-
      usal pages for reviews.
      I trust that you are well. I adore you and think continually
      of you, pausing neither when I write or sleep from contemplating
      your fabulous enchanting visions.
      I love you, I love you
      Lawrence

      N.G.  29 III 1951
      Dearest Sylvia,
      I do hpe that you have a pleasant Easter and I do hope that
      spring, which is already encouraging exquisite pink blossoms
      here, will surround you with fresh and lovely colours.  Will you
      be able to paint some of the blossoms at Pett unhid you so
      after have missed at this season in the past?
      I enclose some juroge drawings (done with the aid of a cand-
      le) over which are lyrics dedicated to you.  I hope the complic-
      ation pleases you:  I think it rather successful.  Speaking of
      wirting Ophie is at last written.  I will send ou a copy soon.
      Going over my note, I realised how much of it I owed to you.
      Indeed my own contribution is quite tiny compared with your es-
      sential perceptions.  I know what Death's sacrifice is, and the
      way:  my only discovery!
      It is my mother's birthday tomorrow and I shall spend the day
      there.  A nice lot to drink will dispel the last of my cold.  Inci-
      dentally I have just lectured without much difficulty so
      you will realise I am nearly well.
      Your two oils are now at the RA.  How good they are.  I am sure
      that they must be admitted.  They are coherent yet daring de-
      signs--divinely painted.
      Owing to some with typographical slip name in Art News in left off the Brauner
      review:  on the other hand it is dignified and exemption from the us-
      ual pagers for reviews.
      I trust that you are well.  I adore you and think continually
      of you, pausing neither when I write or sleep from contemplating
      your fabulous enchanting vision.
      I love you, I love you
      Lawrence
