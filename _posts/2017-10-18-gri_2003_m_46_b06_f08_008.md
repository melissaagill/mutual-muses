      9th Augsut 1953
      My dearest Sylvia
      I will collect your pictures from the R W S gallery
      tomorrow. I think the selection committee must be
      crazy to reject either of them. I sometimes think that
      that send-in is rather a money-making [unclear]ramp[/unclear], any way.
      I saw Alfred M. Frankfurter ed. & publisher of
      America Art News yesterday at the Ritz. We had
      a drink in his white, gold, & green modern rococo
      suite. He wants me to write a regular monthly
      article about Art in London for his journal.
      Denis Sutton has been doing it for the last 2
      years : now it's me. He was very nice
      about my sculpture article - saying it was
      much superior (to his America taste) to most
      British criticism. He liked my informal style :
      Sutton, on the other hand, has been getting dull.
      It looks like my admiration for American
      critical prose style is beginning to show.

      9th August 1953

      My dearest Sylvia

      i will collect your pictures from the RWS gallery tomorrow. I think the selection committee must be crazy to reject either of them. I sometimes think that that send-in is rather a money-making [unclear]ramp[/unclear], anyway.

      I saw Alfred M Frankfurter ed. & publisher of American Art News yesterday at the Ritz. We had a drink in his white, gold & green modern rococo suite. He wants me to write a regular monthly article about Art in London for his journal. Denis Sutton has been doing it for the last 2 years, now it's me. I start in Dec. The pay is 75 dollars a month. He was very nice about my sculpture article - saying it was much superior (to his American taste) to most British criticism. He likes my informal style: Sutton, on the other hand has been getting dull. It looks like my admiration for American critical prose style is beginning to show.
