      V
      Like the fellow once said:
      There's only love to give you now.
      In my love find the jewels
      I cannot give you now.
      Better than looking at jewels
      For love that is only said.
      So, as metaphor,
      This Christmas, darling, take
      A sky-fallen meteor
      Mounted in silver, and flowers
      Opening like a warm splash, hours
      After the kiss, in a year's slow take.
      Three kingly lions
      Approach your door
      Throw off their beards
      And roll on the lawn.
