      [17-8 '51]
      Blackheath
      Sunday

      Dearest Sylvia,
      I feel very sad and worried to have written so few letters. I am
      sorry, my dearest love, but I have been very busy and, as a re-
      sult [unclear]tried[/unclear], for the last day or two.

      Thank you so much for Picture Post and your [unclear]various[/unclear] outings. I
      intend to read them all at tea-time today. Liam shall have a
      grand leisurely at-home tea with lots of biscuits: !
      I shall go through your last 2 letters, both of which came yester-
      day, point by point.

      No, no news of the TV job; I can't have got it, of course, by now.
      I am pleased to hear that you have been working on kissing. How
      I long to see it.  Dandy will have to send Hetty down for a color-report.
      All C's books are on their way by now. I am glad he has had the
      time to start the article. I look forward very much to his lecture
      in April. Yawolla wants to come; what do you think? Incident-
      ally I am posting you the [unclear]Ferrarere[/unclear] book tomorrow. IC is only on loan
      so do not let Michael get his hands on it. The publisher needs it
      back unfortunately.

      None of Paul's scary people wanted any designs. Teacher alone
      is willing to see him and he is out of London just at present. His
      producer friend Herbert [unclear]Williges[/unclear] may be able to help him though,
      Financially I am a little bit better: the NG [unclear]vone[/unclear] sent me 5.
      That's all so far I'm afraid. But do not worry, dear my love.
      How inconvenient of the [unclear]lues[/unclear] co. not to take unaccompanied
      parcels. Ypu should have sent two! I will go to clearing
      X on Tuesday, at noon, for your picture, without any incon-
      venience. I have the W.I.A.C. forms. You, as a non-member
      may only submit two works, I'm afraid. Tell me by Wednesday
      morning which two I [unclear]seaned[/unclear] submit for you. I will sign the
      forms for you: Yawolla is practicing your signature already
      so that the forgery will be perfect:
