      we went together. If you have similar weather it will be lovely - bright & fresh - in the studio. I do hope so.
      Lion must pack his bag and go to the station (you remember, it is in the long road with several cathedrals in it), go to town - lunch - then to Liverpool Street where a train will take me to Ely. I am a blue lion at the red lion. I do hope that you are happier today.
      I love you so much, I love you
