      a delightful open air tang about it - your very phrases are confident and bracing.
      You do seem to have been uncommonly strenuous and creative in the open. Lion

      T.G. 3.1.52
      Dearest Sylvia
      Forgive me, but there was very little time to contact Wendy [unclear]Korp.[/unclear] And, as you know, I am but slightly acquainted with her.
      My regency lecture was very poorly attended: three! Sculpture, the week before had 25 or so, on the other hand. The numbers aught to go up a bit for Blake this afternoon I should think.
      Your account of gardening has a delightful open air tang about it - your very phrases are confident and bracing. You do seem to have been uncommonly strenuous and creative in the open. Lion feels rather [unclear]'effunct'[/unclear] in comparison. I am sure it is good for you - provided you care for your hands. I do wish I had been there to help you.
      The rose and the popinjay story pleases me very much. Yes I might be able to write a poem about it. I will attempt it when I have a free moment. Thank you for narrating the exquisite fable. I would like to be able to do justice to it if I can.
      News of Cocteau's Bacchus thrills me. I do look forward to hearing in a future letter something of the plot and Cocteau's treatment.
      I wonder if you would help Lion in the following way. The WEA have not yet paid me for Banstead but I ought to pay Mrs Harrison the 2 months rent I owe her. I have been waiting for the WEA cheque. Could you possibly write me a cheque for the amount which I will pay into my account and write Mrs H my own cheque. Then immediately the Banstead cheque comes I will endorse it and send it to you. You need feel no anxiety. Your money will be entirely safe but I do not want to delay paying Mrs H any longer. The sum is 23 pounds. It will be back in your account within a week or so, I promise. Father is a bit worried about money at the moment so I would like not to ask him this time. Please help your Lion - it is only for a short time and you will soon have the WEA cheque to pay into your own account.
      Here is a short poem for my Muse:

      The sleep of blondes is full of dark
      Heads of waking women; the sleep
      Of men is full of atlases
      Of female countries.
