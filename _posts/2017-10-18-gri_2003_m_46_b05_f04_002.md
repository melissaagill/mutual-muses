      London: N.G.
      1 April 1952
      Dearest Sylvia,
      Your letters are exhilarating as communications from you and yet sad because they are the result of our separation. Your account of reading Tennyson's Princess just the thing for when you are not quite happy, you said - is poignant indeed! I know that feeling. When I lecture it is with your art as a kind of [unclear]volm[/unclear] or standard that I speak - and sometimes you overwhelm the present occasion. That is how I felt during and after today's lecture, a strange feeling of closeness (because art and you are inseparable for me) and a sense of loss and surprise that I was, in fact, alone.
      I will send your watch-strap tomorrow so you should receive it on Thursday.
      No the film show is tonight, not yesterday. I wish you were going to come with me as you did before and to the discussion, for seeing peole who know you - anticipating the meetings even - puts in a new form what I already know, the fact

      of closeness (because art and you are inseparable for me) and a sense of loss
      and surprise that I was , in fact, alone.\nI will send your watch-strap tomorrow
      so you should receive it on Thursday.\nNo the film-show is tonight, not yesterday.
      I wish you were going to come with me as soon as you did before and to the discussion,
