      are you?  I hope every trace of your neuralgia has gone.  I remember how it
      lingered once before, but I tell myself it is Wednesday already so you should
      be recovered.\n\nI look in vain for a way to vary my declarations of love, but
      I must hope that your need to read the words equals my need to write them -
      I love you, and long for the opportunity to say them to you.  I love you so
      much.\n\nI want to write a lover's alphabet.  Will you collaborate?  For example:
      C is for Cupid, curled up asleep; D is for desire which burns when he wakes.
      \ H is for Hymen, honey, and hair.  L is for Lawrence, longing for you.  S is
      for Sylvia, sacrifice to liberty.  And so on.  Send me some suggestions - even
      single words, please.\n\nLe Diable au Corps is exquisite though harrowing.  The
      main point is the boy's evasion of responbility for his actions which are immaturely
      motivated.  Michelene Presle was, perhaps, a shade passive.  I was moved by
      it very much indeed.  Pictorially it is a delight and the action compels attention
      from beginning to end.  \n\nAlso I saw a film called The Pirate with new Cole
      Porter songs including one that amused me called Be A Clown:\n\nIf you become
      a doctor, folk'll face you with dread.\nIf you become a dentist, they'll be
      glad when you're dead.\nBut people always love you if you can stand on your
      head.\nBe a clown, be a clown, &c.\n\nThe sun is on me as I type and makes me
      think how nice it must be at Pett, cold, I imagine, yet fine and crisp.  Oh,
      dear.\n\nIt is nearly eleven o'clock and so time to tell you, once more, that
      my thoughts never leave you.  You possess me even in absence though I hasten
      to remark that this is not a reason to make you think your absence from me is
      easier than from Michael.  I love you and long for our weekend.  Do make it
      two nights.  I love you.\n\nDandylion says that he will return your delicious
      kiss any morning or afternoon when there is a slight breeze and you walk down
      to the shop.  He will kiss the back of your neck, darling.  \n\nEleven has struck.
      \ I love you.\n\nLawrence."

      11, Mansel Road
      Wimbeldon
      20th October 1948

      Dearest Sylvia,

      How are you? I hope every trace of your neuralgia has gone. I remember how it lingered once before, but I tell myself it is Wednesday already so you should be recovered.

      I look in vain for a way to vary my declaration of love, but I must hope that your need to read the words equals my need to write them - I love you, and long for the opportunity to say them to you. I love you so much.

      I want to write a lover's alphabet. Will you collaborate? For example: C is for Cupid, curled up asleep; D is desire which burns when he wakes. H is for Hymen, honey and hair. L is for Lawrence, longing for you. S is for Sylvia, sacrifice to liberty. And so on. Send me some suggestions - even single words please.

      Le Diable au Corps is exquisite though harrowing. The main point is the boy's evasion of responsibility for his actions which are immaturely motivated. Micheline Presle was, perhaps, a shade passive. I was moved by it very much indeed. Pictorially it is a delight and the action compels attention from beginning to end.

      Also I saw a film called The Pirate with new Cole Porter songs including one that amused me called Be A Clown:
      If you become a doctor, folk'll face you with dread.
      If you become a dentist, they'll be glad when you're dead.
      But people always love you if you can stand on your head.
      Be a clown, be a clown?&c.

      The sun is on me as I type and makes me think how nice it must be at Pett, cold I imagine, yet fine and crisp. Oh, dear.

      It is nearly eleven o'clock and so time to tell you once more, that my thoughts never leave you. You possess me even in absence though I hasten to remark that this is not a reason to make you think absence from me is easier than from Michael. I love you and long for our weekend. Do make it two    nights. I love you.

      Dandylion says that he will return your delicious kiss any morning or afternoon when there is a slight breeze and you walk down to the shop. He will kiss the back of your neck, darling.

      Eleven has struck.  I love you.
