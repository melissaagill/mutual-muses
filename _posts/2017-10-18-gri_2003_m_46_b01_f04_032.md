      Here is a second sonnet for you:
      Like dust on a book of Ronsard sonnets
      Dew settles on a rose, each drop as clear
      As crystal vases' facets, waiting near,
      To boast of the pink captive, we won it.

      Dew settles on the poem dew, not dust,
      Using the tender hackneyed image, rose,
      And is refreshed, a book we never close,
      And on its clasp, look, there is blood not rust.

      Obscure and fascinating albums
      Recording a collective [unclear]deathless[/unclear] theme,
      By pirate, cavalier, and decadent,
      Open for every loner as if Time
      Had never won from Cupid the engagement
      And made a rose his trophy with a smile.

      Line 11 refers to any Elizabethan, any of Charles' supporters, and lastly Verlaine - all of whom adored, as we do, the rose.

      A voice from the past.  It is a poem I wrote, or rather an unfinished fragment, before we were lovers.  I do not exactly recall the occasion and the surrealist images do not help but it shows how, early, you attracted my imag-ination. I had written 'poems' on the top of it and must have supposed you would never see it. But here it is, a part of the hom-age due, darling:

         Dew settles on a rose, each drop as clear
         As crystal  vases' facets, waiting near,

         Dew settles on the poem then, not dust,
         Using the tender hackneyed image, rose,
         And is refreshed, a book, we never close,
         And on its clasp, look, there is blood not rust.

         Open for every lover as if Time

         And made a rose his trophy with a smile.

      line 11 refers to any Elizabethan, any of [unclear]Charles'[/unclear] supporters,
      and lastly, Verlaine - all of whom adored, as we do, the
      rose.

         A voice from the past.  It is a poem I wrote, or rather
      an unfinishe fragment, before we were lovers.  I do not
