      Blackheath                              12 ix 1949

      Dearest Sylvia,

      I have just heard from Miss Chick that John has me down for St. Albans despite the fact that I asked for Hammersmith; also that Hammersmith has been taken, now, by somebody else. I am rather angry but, obviously, can only register the palest protest: John is still on holiday. Had he been there this might not have happened.

      I have two Friday lectures in November, now. I have to talk about 'David and Neo-classicism' and 'Ingres" at Birmingham University. I get L5 plus expenses.  Charles gave them my name. (11th and 18th are the dates.)

      Oh, yes, you asked about Banstead: that course begins on Wednesday 21st, in nine days time.

      I am surprised that your reaction to The Third Man was so mild, I enjoyed it enormously. No, more, I was ravished by it. In imagination so superior to Carol Reed's Fallen Idol in which there was a minimum-technique, I thought. The irony with which the central character is handled seemed to me admirable. I want to see it again very much. I think Michael might have mentioned Fritz Lang as an influence as much as Orson Welles.

      The British Council exhibition had 4 Hogarths I had not seen before and The March to Finchly was on the floor and without glass so marvellously visible as never before. Gainsborough's Mr. and Mrs. Andrews was there which I had never seen before. And a marvellous Wilson of Tivoli, which included the temple you painted on the left, the coastal plain being seen beyond that. The right foreground was just before the main falls which were not running the day we were there.

      Blackheath                      12 ix 1949

      Dearest Sylvia,

           I have just heard from Miss Chick that John has
      me down for St. Albans despite the fact that I asked
      for Hammersmith; also that Hammersmith has been
      taken, now, by somebody else. I am rather angry
      but, obviously, can only register the palest pro-
      test: John is till on holiday. Had he been there
      this might not have happened.

           I have two Friday lectures in November, now;
      I have to talk about 'David and Neo-classicism' and
      'Ingres' at Birmingham University. I get  5 plus
      expenses. Charles gave them my name (11th
      and 18th are the dates.)

           Oh, yes, you asked about Banstead: that course
      begins on Wednesday 21st, in nine days time.

           I am surprised that your reaction to The Third Man
      was so mild, I enjoyed it enormously. No, more, I
      was ravished by it. In imagination so superior to
      Carol Reed's Fallen Idol in which there was a minimum-
      technique, I thought. The irony with which the cen-
      tral character is handled seemed to me admirable.
       I
      want to see it again very much. I think Michael might
      have mentioned Fritz Lang as an influence as much as
      Orson Welles.

           The British Council exhibition had 4 Hogarths I had
      not seen before and The March to Finchly was on the floor
      and without glass so marvelously visible as never before.
      Gainsborough's Mr and Mrs Andrews was there which I had
      never seen before. And a marvelous Wilson of Tivoli,
      which included the temple you painted on the left, the
      coastal plain being seen beyond that. The right fore-
      ground was just before the main falls which were not
      running the day we were there.
