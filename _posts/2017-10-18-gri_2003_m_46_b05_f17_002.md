    clean_transcription: but there is always something.<br/>I am happy to say that
      it<br/>rained in the night and is now<br/>deliciously fine again so I can<br/>get
      on with my fig tree and I<br/>shall feel reassured by your letter -<br/>I'm
      sorry if I misjudged you -<br/>I love you so much - and get de-<br/>pressed
      easily if parted from you<br/>too long. But you don't seem to expect<br/>me
      on Monday - and for economy<br/>perhaps I should not come - please<br/>let me
      know by return because<br/>I shall want to let Michael<br/>know and my father.<br/>If
      I do not come you will<br/>meet the Woods at Roses as<br/>arranged I presume?<br/>Dear
      poet, how I love you<br/>and look forward to seeing the<br/>City poem, I love
      you<br/>Sylvia<br/>
