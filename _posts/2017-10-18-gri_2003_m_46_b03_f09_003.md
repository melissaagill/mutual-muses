      I have a lecture tomorrow at the H.G. after all for the [unclear] soldiers [/unclear] are coming at 4. I supposed I should talk about battle scenes (Rubens, Uccello & c.) Talking of lectures I noticed the syllabus of the [unclear]Pennington[/unclear] course, and I am the only one giving 3 lectures = several 2s, but no 3s except me. I am pleased . C.J. is not down once!
      LATER
      I have just been to the Arcade Gallery which has a pleasant show. I have to write the review immediately and send it off so I'm afraid that I have to cut this letter short, despite my dearest wishes to the contrary

      I wish you every good fortune with your pictures. I will write properly tomorrow.

    annotation_text: course, vague.  However, it is encouraging.  I have a lecture
      tomorrow at the N.G after all for the soldiers are coming at 4.  I suppose I
      should talk about battle scenes (Rohans, Uccello, &c.)  Talking of lectures
      I received a syllabus of the Birmingham course, and I am the only one giving
      3 lectures - several 2s, but no 3s except me.  I am pleased.  C.J. is not down
      once!  LATER  I have just been to the Arcade Gallery which was a pleasant show.  I
      have to write the review immediately and send it off so I'm afraid that I have
      to cut this letter short, despite my dearest wishes to the contrary.  I wish
      you every good fortune with your picture.  I will write properly tomorrow.  I
      love you Lawrence
