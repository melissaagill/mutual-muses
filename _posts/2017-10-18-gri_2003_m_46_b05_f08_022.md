      Yesterday's lecture went rather well.  I amused an 25-30 audience by describing John[unclear] Nask's[/unclear] Cornfield as a vision of England as seen to a 30's weekender on SHELL.  (The[unclear] paint[/unclear] has an additional suburban quality - like rough-cast, or VanGogh- tamed.)
      This afternoon I have a committee meeting with the handwriting people.  As I have to go to town I am meeting Father for lunch.
      I talked to an American girl after the lecture (a niece of Duncan Phillips of the Washington gal. of that name) who admired London much more that Paris, wished she could stay here, & praised English music, theatre, & life way above America.  I thought I should pass this on: patriotic lion to patriotic cat.
      I took your shoes in yesterday (ready on Tuesday next).  I must shave, & do some shopping, before going to town.
      I love you dearest & wait impatiently for your return.
      I adore you
