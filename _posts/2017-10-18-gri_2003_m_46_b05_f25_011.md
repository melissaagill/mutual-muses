      THE MURDERER AND THE AD-MAN

      Among the great collector's empire,
      in the mine and cellar of the state,
      a head awaits the crown, a torso lacks
      the parrot on the shoulder, and the throne
      is missing from beneath the buttock's chin:
      o careless inclination of the bust!

      He may be thought to count the fragments
      to make a tribe out of a single girl:
      maybe another hand among the pair
      would lead a multiplying family.
      Since Adam was the father and fell
      he is no alien who sorts the flesh.

      In the daily corridors, the stairs,
      the left that smooths the fall, we overhear
      a mouth deprived of muscles and a jaw,
      watch breasts minus the human cage, a head
      mobilized in currents of the airshaft,
      crushed by a comb or risen to a hat.

      Great head on hoardings think twelve hours a day
      and eyes in neon persecute the night:
      somewhere else, another part of town,
      bodies rehearse olympiads of power
      witnessed by the anecdotal crowd
      intent on pleasure just beyond the nose.

      Instead of London or New York these signs
      travel ahead of me and shape the fall:
      these relics overlap the city's cross.
      corrode the skyline and the terraces.
      (Always a queen, sucking the morbid lips
      and playing ball with John's romantic head.)

      Voices in empty rooms set me looking
      for the sign of a wounded oracle,
      bleeding yet not speechless in the corner,
      dust on her lips and daylight through her mouth,
      carrying on, excited and obscure,
      'men, not gods, should eat Prometheus' liver'.

      In mailed apartments teeth are drawn
      to slice the apples dawn throws in the room
      through swaying curtains early in this late.
      The water in the six-foot chalice dies
      consumed by labyrinthine worms in pipes
      designed for liquid colored by the flesh.
