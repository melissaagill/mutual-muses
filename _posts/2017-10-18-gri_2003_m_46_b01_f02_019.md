      dearest Silvia
      I'm still not sure how long we will be at the address so will you use the [unclear]cook's[/unclear] address 2 Place de la Madeleine.
      The weather is superb here. We sat in the Luxembourg Gardens, for a time, only in shirt sleeves, and, last evening had a look at the Hotel Cluny as you recommended. It's really admirable Gothic craftsmanship in the windows (Dormers especially) and renaissance forms also. The place has grandeur and mystery and I kept thinking of Rilke's half sensuous, half platonic in there when he was Rodin's secretary. It is not open to the public yet but I am going to try for permission to see it.
      I have got a [unclear]freres[/unclear] Vogue which I am sending off . I hope you will get some ideas for it though I might as well admit that I keep thinking of you nude. I adore you.
      Politically I am isolated as ever and on every hoarding rows of unintelligible initials jump like letters in a cubist still life - a still life gone very wrong. Each party has numerous initials. I have learnt a little about existentialism from a student who is going to introduce me to a poet who can help me further in this matter.
      I have been four times to the Trésons des Musée de Viennes

      I have got a [unclear][/unclear] Vogue [unclear]weird[/unclear] I am sending off tomorrow. I hope you will get some ideas for it though I might as well admit that I keep thinking of you nude. I adore you.
