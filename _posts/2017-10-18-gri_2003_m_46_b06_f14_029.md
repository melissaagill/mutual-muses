      and I do hope the Tate isn't flooded--
      isn't the weather vile!  I haven't been
      out for days!
      I enclose some cuttings which may
      interest you--one of the lecture you
      gave at Hastings--it seems so long
      ago.
      I shall be going to Cambridge on Thursday,
      and will call in at Blackheath about 10.30
      or 10 o'clock for the Big painting, Bilston
      Rye Bay, the Blue glass vase, and Peliv Raven
      Rome and still life with cherries, if they can
      possibly be got in.  I shall be with you
      on Monday--and catch the 10.10 which
      will arrive about 11.25--and I think
      I will go to Swiss Cottage and collect
      everything up.  It will be wonderful to
      see you again.  The pictures at Blackheath
      that I have left out all need attention--but
      it doesn't promote to much--I think that
      is only 2!
      I'm afraid I can't post this this
      afternoon the snow is almost horizontal
      the wind is so high.  I am sitting by the
      fire in the studio.  I'm not allowed to
      be anywhere else!
      I hope you enjoy your supper with
      Passmore.  It's particularly pleasant to
      sup with someone nice so near home!
      I love you, my sweet muse, I
      love you.

      \   I shall be going to Cambridge on Thursday, \nand will call in at Blackheath
      about 10.30 \nor 10 o'clock for the Big painting, Bilston \nRye Bay, the blue
      glass vase, Peter Raven \nRome & Still life with cherries, if they can \npossibly
      be got in.  I shall be with you \non Monday - and catch the 10.10 which \nwill
      arrive about 11.25 - and I think \nI will go to Swiss Cottage and collect \neverything
      up.  It will be wonderful to \nsee you again.  The pictures at Blackheath \nthat
      I have left out all need attention - but \nit doesn't amount to much.  I think
      that \nis only 2! \n    I'm afraid I can't post this this \nafternoon the snow
      is almost horizontal \nthe wind is so high - I am sitting by the \nfire in the
      studio - I'm not allow to \nbe anywhere else!\n     I hope you enjoy your supper
      with \nPasmore.  It's particularly pleasant to \nsup with someone nice so near
