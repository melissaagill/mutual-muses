      pity that he has to go out today
      as there is a frightful eastward.  So
      I have not worked in the garden.
      I have noticed though that some beans
      ave come through I shall plant a few
      more to finish the row.
      Tiny has Miss Peace to tea--she (T)
      is very gloomy again, but I say how
      wonderful you are and how I enjoyed
      my stay.  Indeed you are wonderful,

      I have no worked in the garden.<br/>I have noticed though that some team have
      come through I shall plant a few more to finish the row.<br/>Tiny has made peace
      to tea - she(t) is very gloomy again, but I say how wonderful you are and how
      I enjoyed my stay. Indeed you are wonderful, my gentle lion. So kind and loving,
      so brilliant and handsome, with the bluest eyes and most golden hair in the
      world, so elegant and charming, always courteous! I love you, and long to see
      you again. I must however work hard now I am back to get in the lead.
