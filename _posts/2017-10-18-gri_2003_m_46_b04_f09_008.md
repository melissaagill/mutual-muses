      7 September 1951  Dearest Sylvia,

      I have been working rather hard today I am going to take it
      easy.  I have cleaned the flat: tht perhaps is not taking it
      easy but it was getting very dusty and I feel relaxed having done
      it.  Then I have just stepped from a bath.  It is about 11:00 in
      the morning.  Tomorrow I must start work on the pre-Raphaelites -
      but not until tomorrow.  Tuesday's lecture is on (18th portraiture -
      which needs little preparation:  I am including Wright's Brooke
      Boothby.  Thursday's in on the pre-Raphaelites and that is the
      one which is something of a problem.  Thursday is the 13th Sept-
      ember so perhaps I'll have the pleasure of seeing you in the aud-
      ience then:  if not I expect I shall meet you that day.  I could
      get to Lewisham, if you're coming by bus, by 5 o'clock.  Banstead,
      by the way, begins on Wednesday 19th - the day of the I.C.A. discus-
      sion about Read so I shall not be there after all.  (At least I
      won't have to read Education Through Art, which I was dreading.)

      I have only one overdue library book.  Is that a record?  I
      have read Finberg's Turner and Mona Wilson biography of Blake.
      I have also glanced through Wertheim's Show of Violence, but found
      it terribly badly written and crudely popular.  Otherwise I sup-
      pose it is alright.  You know what Valery says:  'It is by no means
      the mischievous who do most harm in the world.  It is the awkward,
      the neglient and the credulous'.  Hetty is hoping to make a sampl-
      er with this on it.  Yawolla has made an effort to learn it but he
      keeps mixing it up.  Lionel chuckled appreciatively and capped it with
      something in Greek.  Valery's aphorism makes one terribly impat-
      ient with most of the books one has to read in the course of duty,
      getting lectures ready and so on.  I have been snatching time to
      read Rene Char again:  have I quoted this to you before -

      Un papillon de paille habitait un crane de chien:
      O couleurs o jachere o danse:

      My own poems are progressing well but I am afraid I have not had
      sufficient leisure to prepare them for my cat's eyes yet.  It is still
      growing spasmodically fragment by fragment, and it is too early to
      control it.  I think it will be a sequence of shortish poems
      rather than one long one.  Beyond that I am in the dark.  Are you
      not a mysterious muse (working in mysterious purrs).

      I shall eat and sleep at Wimbledon tonight (conveniently near the
      V and A where I shall be Saturday) but not before I have tea with
      John McHale.  That means I shall see the two films I mentioned -
      including Top Hat:  O I wish you were to be there with me.  But
      soon, soon you'll be here to cut me from the hairshirt of
      missing you.  Dearest love, you are my life.

      I adore, adore you,
      Lawrence

(At least I won't have to read Education Through Art, which I was dreading.)

      I have only one overdue library book. Is that a record? I have read Finberg's Turner and Mona Wilson biography of Blake. I have also glanced through Wertheim's Show of Violence, but found it terribly badly written and crudely popular. Otherwise I suppose it is alright.

    clean_transcription: '7 September 1951<br/>Dearest Sylvia<br/>I have been working
      rather hard so today I am going to take it easy. I have cleaned the flat: that
      perhaps is not taking it easy but it was getting very dusty and I feel relaxed
      having done it. Then I have just stepped from a bath. It is about 11.00 in the
      morning. Tomorrow I must start work on the pre-Raphaelites - but not until tomorrow.
      Tuesday''s lecture is on 18th Century portraiture - which needs little preparation:
      I am including Wright''s Brooke Boothby. Thursday''s is on the pre-Raphaelites
      and that is the one that is something of a problem. Thursday is the 17th September
      so perhaps I''ll have the pleasure of seeing you in the audience then: if not,
      I expect I shall meet you that day. I could get to Lewisham, if you''re coming
      by bus, by 5 o''clock. Banstead, by the way, begins on Wednesday 19th - the
      day of the I.C.A. discussion about Read so I shall not be there after all. (At
      least I won''t have to read Education Through Art, which I was dreading.)<br/><br/>I
      have only one overdue library book. Is that a record? I have read Finberg''s
      Turner and Mona Wilson''s biography of Blake. I have also glanced through Wertheim''s
      Show of Violence, but found it terribly badly written and crudely popular. Otherwise
      I suppose it is alright. You know what Valery says: ''It is by no means the
      mischievous who do most harm in this world. It is the awkward, the negligent
      and the credulous''. Hetty is hoping to make a sampler with this on it. Yawolla
      has made an effort to learn it but he keeps mixing it up. Lionel chuckled appreciatively
      and capped it with something in Greek. Valery''s aphorism makes one terribly
      impatient with most of the books one has to read in the course of duty, getting
      lectures ready and so on. I have been snatching time to read Rene Char again:
      have I quoted this to you before - <br/>Un papillon de paille habitait un crane
      de chien:<br/>O couleurs o jachere o danse.<br/><br/>My own poems are progressing
      well but I am afraid I have not had sufficient leisure to prepare them for my
      cat''s eyes yet. It is still growing spasmodically, fragment by fragment, and
      it is too early to control it. I think it will be a sequence of shortish poems
      rather than one long one. Beyond that I am in the dark. Are you not a mysterious
      muse (working in mysterious purrs).<br/><br/>I shall eat and sleep at Wimbledon
      tonight (conveniently near the V and A where I shall be Saturday) but not before
      I have tea with John McHale. That means I shall see the two films I mentioned
      - including Top Hat: O I wish you were here with me. But soon, soon you''ll
      be here to cut me free from the hair-shirt of missing  you. Dearest love, you
      are my life.<br/>I adore, adore you,<br/>Lawrence'
