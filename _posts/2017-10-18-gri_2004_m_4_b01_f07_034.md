      Dandy, when Hetty had cleaned him down and scolded Yawolla, made a small piece of sculpture with albastine. He used a piece of glass, a screw, some nails, cork, an empty pan of watercolour, a shell and a piece of green cord. It is not very nice but has given me an idea for something better. What of your collages?
      Charles was a terrible bore at tea: I had an absurd fear that I was going to fall asleep as he droned on and on about people I do not know or people I do know but in whom I am not interested.
      I am going to Hammersmith tomorrow for dinner with Ray Howard-Jones so I shall collect your ticket and pay the immense guilty fine.
      Hetty is being very attentive, you will be pleased to hear, creaming me, brushing my hair regularly, giving me lots of milk, making me eat regularly. Is, in fact, behaving like her Silvio ....
      My parents took me to Jour de Fete, which is amusing but by no means the scream Dilys Powell seems to think it is. Afterwards we had dinner and on the menu was, for the first time since Italy, the word casata: you can imagine I was only restrained from starting with one with difficulty. It made me think of Florence and Rome and Venice. We had not discovered these in Milan.
      Remark, incidentally, the opening paragraph of Isaac's Thornhill araticle. Cadbury's Rococo....
      The letter must have been guided by Hetty - it jumps about from sujet a sujet (remark the foreign language!) in a way that reminds me of how she chatters on about a multitude of subjects.
      But Hetty or Dandy, whoever writes, no letter could end without all our love.
      I love you.
      Lawrence
      PS I have secured Artemis is ints frame with hundreds of nails - I'm sure its safe. XX L
