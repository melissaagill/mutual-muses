      is nowhere where I<br/>would rather live. I am reconciled<br/>to being here
      a good deal without<br/>you until after my show. But I<br/>don't feel I can
      happily bear it<br/>after next summer for in the winter<br/>Clifford is overworked
      and cross and<br/>Tiny seems always off to Littlehampton.<br/>Also financially
      I am quite dependent<br/>on letting the flat and living here<br/>at a low rent
      - My own money<br/>gets less every year; and if Tiny<br/>or Clifford's mother
      should die they<br/>might make other plans. I love<br/>you dearly and my work
      is very<br/>important to me - but fear I<br/>may end without either, for<br/>Clifford
      visualizes your love cooling with<br/>recurring money troubles - and I shall<br/>have
      to go out to work again to<br/>keep myself. This is of course
