      Dear Silvia

      Thanks to you the Steve McEvoy lecture was a real success.  24 or 25 people as we expected.  One lady complimented me on the [unclear]Enso[/unclear] parallel - so I must pass that on to you.  The essential points were made by you and all  had to do was find a frame for your perceptions.

      I had a letter from [unclear]Lincoln[/unclear] today saying that if  can get to [unclear][/unclear] in time would I care to have lunch with Lord Ancaster.  It will mean getting up at about 6.30 but I think I shall do so (lions love lords).  I shall need to borrow an alarm clock from Wimbledon, [unclear][/unclear].

      What have you done I wonder the last day or two for the weather has been so bad.  Perhaps you have had time for the white still life.

      By the way, the basement galleries of the Tate are open again.

      Lion has had his hair cut this afternoon.  Paul Harding had called in and left his new telephone number with ted so I shall probably see him before I come to Hastings and hear how his [unclear][/unclear] are going.  I [unclear][/unclear]any press publicity but that does not mean a thing.

      I saw a double feature programme yesterday evening.  As a result I have located a new device, or rather named a standard one - 2 people look at each other from considerable distance and we get close-ups.  When the close-ups exceed visual possibility, even yours, the near view is dire, [unclear][/unclear] - it is the Psychic close-up, as opposed to the rational usual kind of intimate shot.

      How was the modern lecture - and how are your own [unclear]rates[/unclear] coming.]?  Well I am sure for you have done much work already.

      To return for a moment to the lecture - the applause was rather loud and there were several spontaneous thank yous.  So you have your share, my love.

      I do love you.  How much I miss you.  You are never out of my mind.  I am sorry you cannot come to Banstead tomorrow - sad you will not be at home when I get back there in an hour's time.

      Love you, oh I love you
      Lawrence

      to you the Steer-McEvoy lecture was a real success. 24 or 25 people as we expected.
      One lady complimented me on the Ensor parallel so I must pass that on to you.
      The essential points were made by you & all I had to do was find a frame for
      your perceptions.<br/>I had a letter from Lincoln today saying that if I can
      get to Lincoln in time would I care to have lunch with Lord Ancaster. It will
      mean getting up at about 6.30 but I think I shall do so (lions love lords).
      I shall need to borrow an alarm clock from Wimbledon, however.<br/>What have
      you done I wonder the last day or two for the weather has been so bad. Perhaps
      you have had time for the White Still Life.<br/>By the way, the basement galleries
      at the Tate are open again.<br/>Lion has had his hair cut this afternoon. Paul
      (Harding) had called in and left his telephone number with Ted so I shall probably
      see him before I come to Hastings, and hear how his bats are going. I have not
      seen any press publicity but that does not mean a thing.<br/>I saw a double
      feature programme yesterday evening. As a result I have located a new device,
      or rather named a standard one: 2 people look at each other from considerable
      distances and we get close-ups. When the close ups exceeds visual possibility,
      even yours, the near view is dictated by the libido purely: it is The Psychic
      Close-Up, as opposed to the natural usual kind of intimate shot.<br/>How was
      the Modern Lecture - and how are your own notes coming? Well I am sure for you
      have done much work already.<br/>To return, for a moment, to the lecture: the
      applause was rather loud & there were several spontaneous thank yous. So you
      must have your share, my love.<br/>I do love you. How much I miss you. You are
      never out of my mind. I am sorry you cannot come to Banstead tomorrow - sad
      you will not be at home when I get back there in an hour''s time.<br/>Oh I love
      you love you<br/>Lawrence'
