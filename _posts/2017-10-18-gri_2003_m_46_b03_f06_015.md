      On the Boat      6 vii 1950
      Dearest Sylvia
      I love you and so wish that you were here.  The weather is not plea-
      sant but Paris is nearer every minute and you, alas, farther
      away.  On the other hand I shall consider every minute passed
      in Paris as a movement back to you, for which meeting I long.
      Though separated in space, Time, unwelcome & feared by some,
      shall collaborate with Venus to bring us together again.  And
      oh my Minerva, paint for your Apollo in his absence, as I
      shall write because you, as my muse, are not absent. I have
      already today scribbled down a few lines for poems, which
      I will send in my next letter or, if this letter goes on for a long
      time- that is, if I cannot post it today- attach to the end of
      this.
      I have two cases, one which you know is Paul's hold-all. [unclear]??????[/unclear] Neither
      of them is too heavily laden and in any case I'm sending my bag
      registered so I shall not have to worry about it until I reach
      Paris.
      Before leaving home, I tidied up and believe that there is nothing
      to rot or fall over.  Mrs. Williams is going to look after the flowers
      for us.  If you should visit the golden[unclear]?[/unclear] on the mantlepiece
      you will find it, I hope, in good condition though not, perhaps, spick
      & span.  I sent off the key this morning- so I expect you will
      have it by the time this reaches you.  Mrs. Williams, of course,
      has the other.
      Yesterday I took your pictures from the AIA.  I will make you a
      proper member when I return.
      Waiting for me at the [unclear]N.G.[/unclear] was a present from Mrs. Brock of the
      American girls I lectured to last week.  4 carton of 200
      cigarettes.  Tell [unclear]Tiny[/unclear] I will send her some when I come back.
      Wasn't it nice of Mrs. Brock? [unclear]Tawalla[/unclear] tried to smoke some but
      he doesn't really like it.
