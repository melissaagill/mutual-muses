      I will send you a P.O. for
      my brooch as I expect you're
      "broke"!
      I say, what about sending
      the new Athene number to
      the N.S. and N? Don't you
      think it's just their cup of tea?
      I so much enjoyed my short
      stay. I love you so much -
      dearest Lawrence, Lion Lion!
      My Poet.
      Must post this now.
      I love you
