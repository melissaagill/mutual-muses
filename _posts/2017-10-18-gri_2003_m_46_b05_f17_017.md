      Rectory Lodge
      Pett
      Dearest Lawrence -
      Thank you so much for the
      delicious quartrains - oh my love,
      how sweet you are. Thank Hetty
      and Dandy for their love and
      exciting cards. I feel so happy
      today because although you are
      not with me I feel that you love
      me. I am happy to think of my
      paintings put out as on an Italian
      Festival - I feel full of confidence
      and ambition.
      Unless you should hear to the
      contrary, (most unlikely and only
      if the bus is full), I shall arrive
      on Sunday afternoon bus - bringing
      my meat. (pork so have an
      apple!)

      I feel so happy today because although you are not with me I feel you that you
      love me. I am happy to think of my paintings put out as on an Italian festival
      - I feel full of confidence and ambition. <br/><br/>you should hear to the contrary  (most
      unlikely and only if the bus is full) I shall arrive on Sunday afternoon bus
      - bringing my meat (pork so have an apple!)
