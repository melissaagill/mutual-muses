      II

      But in the dew upon your lips and those
      Transparent globes that linger in the groves
      Under your upstretched arms, the element
      Of fire or altitude would ne a plant:
      No, like a traveller happy at the sight

      Your pearls and dew are my cases.
      The blood is like the fire, but in its course
      Moves like a river in the living map,
      Tribal and vivid feeds each shape,
      In breasts and lips, in parted thighs.

      Like ripeness from a fruit another liquid
      Ferments into the wine of the id
      Whose gift is freedom from gravity
      (Like that of swimmers in a rolling sea):
      The wine glass and the vase are both full-filled.

      The flower in the feminine vase
      Waters itself and the cup of flesh:
      From these liquids we distill
      Love potions to inflame us still.
      Each time we love we mix the next embrace.

      The image of the 'transparent globes' is one that has been
      in mind since you told me of that cavalier poem with the
      sweat-pearls image.  I think we could call this poem, In Defence of Water.

      In the seven days till I see you again, I am going to
      work hard.  I am going now to town to spend an afternoon
      in the B?M. print room - looking at the prints in which The
      Analysis of Beauty is criticised.  Then tomorrow I can
      start a new chapter, dealing with the last works - in-
      cluding Virtue in Danger and Sigismunda.  You are and
      will be as I work in my mind all the time.

      Dearest Sylvia, I love you, you made me happy coming
      here, I hope I made you happy.  I love you,
      Lawrence

      II
      But in the dew upon your lips and those
      Transparent globes that linger in the groves
      Under your upstretched arms, the element
      Of fire or altitude would be a plant:
      No, like a traveller happy at the sight

      Your pearls and dew are my cases.
      The blood is like the fire, but in its course
      Moves like a river in the living map,
      Tribal and vivid feeds each shape,
      In breasts and lips, in parted thighs.

      Like ripeness from a fruit another liquid
      Ferments into the wine of the id
      Whose gift is freedom from gravity
      (Like that of swimmers in a rolling sea):
      The wine glass and the vase are both full-filled.

      The flower in the feminine vase
      Waters itself and the cup of flesh:
      From these liquids we distill
      Love potions to inflame us still.
      Each time we love we mix the next embrace.

      The image of the 'transparent globes' is one that has been in mind since you told me of that cavalier poem with the sweat-pearls image.  I think we could call this poem In Defence of Water.

          In the seven days till I see you again I am going to work hard.  I am going now to town to spend an afternoon in the B?M.  print room - looking at prints in which The Analysis of Beauty is criticised.  Then tomorrow I can start a new chapter, dealing with the last works - including Virtue in Danger and Sigismunda.  You are and will be as I work in my mind all the time.

          Dearest Sylvia, I love you, you made me happy coming here, I hope I made you happy.  I love you,
      Lawrence
