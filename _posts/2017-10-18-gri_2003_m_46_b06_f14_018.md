      and I should be most grateful if you could manage to fetch it some time before the 19th. It will also serve as credentials to get the picture.
      I'm so glad you approve of the letter to [unclear]Vogue[/unclear] thank you so much for typing it. Which of the 2 photographs do you think I should send?
      I had news of you and love from Clifford. I'm so glad that you had such a good time. I have asked Clifford and Marjorie to lunch with you and me, and Michael if he can get away, and my Aunt Elsie. I think it will be a good send off. This is the 5th of course. I take it for granted that you'll be at my service that day! I should like Herbert to come in the late morning if he could and take a group as well as the gallery - that would be fun! do find out his terms won't you. By the way [unclear]Hull [/unclear] Walton never showed up! I was very fed up.

      2  and I should be most grateful if
      you could manage to fetch it some time
      before the 19th.  It will also serve as
      credentials to get the picture.
         I'm so glad you approve of the letter
      to Vogue thank you so much for typing
      it -- which of the 2 photographs do you
      think I should send?
         I had news of you and   love from
      Clifford -- I'm so glad that you had
      such a good time, I have asked
      Clifford and Marjorie to lunch with
      you and me, and Michael if he can
      get away, and my Aunt Elsie --
      I think it will be a good send off --
      this is the 5th of course -- I take
      it for granted that you'll be at my
      Service that day!  I should like
      Herbert to come in the late morning
      if he could and take a group as
      well as the gallery -- that would
      be fun!  Do find out his terms
      won't you.  By the way [unclear]Hull [/unclear] Walton
      never showed up!  C. was very fed
      up.
