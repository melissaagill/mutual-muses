      Concrete Art In The Fifties

      An exhibiton of abstract are was held at 22, Fitzroy Street,
      on 11th-14th July. This adress is the studio of one of a group
      of abstract artists. It was open until 8:00 p.m. over the
      weekend and was thus accessible at a time when the Bond Street
      galleries are closed. Using a studio for a group exhibiton
      (despite problems of hanging) has advantages for visitors may ex-
      pect to meet some of the artists concerned. The group has pub-
      lished two broadsheets and this exhibition (the second of its
      kind) is another effort to reach the public and as such deserves support.
       Victor Pasmore is the centre of the group which includes Robert
      Adams, Adrian Heath, Anthony Hill, and Kenneth Martin. Their
      bias is towards constructivist art, away from the painterly, ex-
      pressionistic character of much recent abstraction ( a tendency
      represented here by Roger Hilton). In addition to this London
      group there are contributions from Cornwall - Ben Nicholson and
      Barbara Hepworth, with Dennis Mitchell and Terry Frost. Nichol-
      son and Hepworth have continued the lucid, classicizing abstract
      art of the thirties into the fifties: the recent work of Pasmore
      (represented by two reliefs in the present show) is a return to
      this attitude, an attempt to restore the continuity of European concrete
      art interupted by war.
      After Pasmore Adams is the most developed member of the group.
      His sculpture and his collages have, for me, a rather English ele-
      gance: his sculpural shapes, at their best, are springy and firm,
      like  a good cricket but, his white lines are those defining a tennis

      Concrete Art in the Fifties

      An exhibition of abstract art was held at 22, Fitzroy Street,
      on 11th-14th July.  This address is the studio of one of a group
      of abstract artists.  It was open until 8.00 p.m. over the
      weekend and was thus accessible at a time when the Bond Street
      galleries are closed.  Using a studio for a group exhibition
      (despite problems of hanging) has advantages for visitors may ex-
      pect to meet some of the artists concerned.  The group has pub-
      lished two broadsheets and this exhibition (the second of its
      kind) is another effort to reach the public and as such deserves
      support.
      Victor Pasmre is the centre of the group which includes Robert
      Adams, Adrian Heath, Anthony Hill, and Kenneth Martin.  Their
      bias is towards constructivist art, away from the painterly, ex-
      pressionistic character of much recent abstraction (a tendency
      represented here by Roger Hilton).  In addition to this London
      group there are contributions from Cornwall--Ben Nicholson and
      Barbara Hepworth, with Dennis Mitchell and Terry Frost.  Nichol-
      son and Hepworth have continued the lucid, classicizing abstract
      art of the thirties into the fifties:  the recent work of Pasmore
      (represented by two reliefs in the present show) is a return to
      this attitude, an attempt to restore the continuity of European concrete
      art interrupted by the war.
      After Pasmore Adams is the msot developed member of the group.
      His sculpture and his collages have, for me, a rather English ele-
      gance:  his sculptural shapes, at their best, are springy and firm,
      like a good cricket bat, his white lines are those defining a tennis
