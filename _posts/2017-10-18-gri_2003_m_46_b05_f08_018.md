      -\nsimply the product of the theatre. I adore it in such\nskilled hands as hers.
      The play itself is pitiful:\nit's a shame there wasn't another play with as

      Tuesday: 13th.

      Dearest Sylvia,

      How nice of Mrs. Clark to accompany you painting. I am very glad she wants you to paint her daughter - it will be very nice to have a new model, I am certain. Next week if the quietest week of the month for me: I have to go to town on Thursday (two lectures) and Saturday (one lecture) only, but there are always things to do in town, so if you need to go to town on other days I shall quite understand.

      Last night a friend of Paul's took him and me to see The Millionairess. Katherine Hepburn is extra-ordinary in a part written for Edith Evans. "Somewhere [unclear][/unclear] HAM & CAMP", I said: Paul suggested the term "HAMP". It is really fascinating to watch the weird prima-donna-ing rhetoric, a virtuosity quite unrelated to life on art - simple the product of the theatre. The play itself is pitiful: it's a shame there wasn't another play with as big a part for her to appear in.

      This afternoon I am sitting to Madeleine for my portrait again. Then I am going on to Edgware to visit Myranda in hospital. I am looking forward to seeing her again: it has been a long time. I shall come home early and have a long night as I am rather tired. But first Hetty has some housework to do. Oh, I shall see you very soon (& I am glad you will stay with me on your return from [unclear] Bath[/unclear], my love).

      I adore you,

      Lawrence
