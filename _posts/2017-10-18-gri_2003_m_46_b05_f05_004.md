      Alright in the water the plaza sways
      Syren of the liquid inn.

      (vi) PROVINCES

      Standstill of water at the bridge's feet,
      Foreshortened silent comedy of houses.
      Cobbles wriggle crazy from the feet
      And shadows flood High Street,

      1 The moon circuits
      2 The marmalade of orchards
      3 As broken chocolate mends

      The plaza's in the water, one of those places
      Lost by land to the herring-bone sea
      Voices music on nights still heard
      Alight in the water the plaza sways
      Syren of the liquid inn

      In coats of the night, clots
      On the season's wen, delayed
      By silver of the sticky clime, stars.

          Too late now: who sips the waterfall
          Risks curtains in the window pool,
           For water bludgeons heads till blind.

           The invisible girl
           Eats all souvenirs.
