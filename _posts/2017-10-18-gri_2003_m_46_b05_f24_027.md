      2 then supper and coffee - (sausage
      rolls mixed bridge rolls and
      mixed buscuits. Pleny of cigarettes,
      then a song. I think Johin
      and Georgie were too. Oh! John
      told a ghost story before the singing.
      They both seem in very good form.
      So far we have had only one
      difference over the alleged "[unclear][/unclear]
      of Restoration plays! So I think
      Christmas will go very well. I
      hope everyone is good, honored, and
      happy at No 11! and I hope
      you have your cheques this week.
      George and John have just gone

      and mixed biscuits. Plenty of cigarettes then a sing song. I think it all went
      very well everyone seemed very happy and I think John and Georgie were too.
      Oh! John told a Ghost Story before the singing.<br/>They both seem in very good
      form. So far we have had only one difference over the alleged "filthiness" of
      Restoration plays! So I think Christmas will go very well. I hope everyone is
      good humoured and happy at No 11! and I hope you have your cheques this week.<br/>George
