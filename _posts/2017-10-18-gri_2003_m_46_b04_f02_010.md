      29 TAVISTOCK SQUARE LONDON WC 1

      25 11 1951

      My dearest Sylvia,
      I am sorry to learn that M is so dreary--i
      do hope that your natural energy will preserve
      your confidence and peace of mind.  I think of
      you constantly and always you are in sweet,
      happy, beautiful states of mind and body; so
      I wish you to be, even when we are apart.
      A letter and enormous form has come from
      the BBC and I have to attend an appointment
      board about the television sale on Monday
      week.  I am rather excited by the prospect.
      In each of the earlier letters I wrote to you,
      incidentally, I meant to say what I have rem-
      embered and a about to say now:  Your two
      new adaptations of your hats are absolutely
      delicious, both the blue one you wore to the
      lecture (!) and film shoes and the plume which you
      wore today you left here.  I do congratulate you about them.
      I have not got any sending-in forms for you
      yet but be assured I have not forgotten:  I
