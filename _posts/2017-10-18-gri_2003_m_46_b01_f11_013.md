      6th December 1248   Wimbledon.

      Dearest Sylvia,
      I have been asking about rooms and have heard of double-rooms at about £2. 10s. One of them sounds nice but it is a basement room so I did not follow it up as we must have plenty of daylight. I am meet-ing somebody on Wednesday who may be able to advise me. As you wanted I am not looking Hampstead way.

      If the postman does not bring me more letters from you I do not think I shall give him a Christmas box.

      Did you read that curious and funny article about Mr Wildman in the Bumper Christmas Number of the Statesman? Your Mrs Beeton book sounds very amus-ing though I doubt if it will be very practical for us to use her recipes at first.

      I hope you are keeping well. I am sad missing you but happy to think of your love.

      I love you, dearest,

      Lawrence
