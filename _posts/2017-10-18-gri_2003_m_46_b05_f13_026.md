      Dearest Lawrence,
      Foolish, uncontrollable
      "angst" caused me to send
      you a telegram, coupled with
      a great longing to hear your
      voice.  It was very silly, Clifford
      disadvised it. But when he
      had gone and I was alone
      reason left me--as you have
      not yet phoned.  I fear that
      you are out, and so it will
      be too late when you arrive,
      of course knowing the PO
      it may not be delivered until
      tomorrow morning--however
      that you won't mind as you
      enjoy telegrams!  But not
      when you come home tired.
      I sent the cheque on Friday
      so I hoped that you would
      get it on Saturday?
      I started my picture
      yesterday--sketching it in and
      doing the background--to-

      "angst" caused me to send you a telegram, coupled with a great longing to hear
      your voice. It was very silly, Clifford disadvised it. But when he had gone
      I was alone reason left me - as you have not yet 'phoned I fear that you are
      out, and so it will be too late when you arrive Opp, of course knowing the P.O
      it may not be delivered until to-morrow morning - however that you won't mind
      as you enjoy telegrams! But not when you come home tired.<br/>I sent the cheque
      on Friday so I hoped that you would get it on Saturday?<br/>I started my picture
      yesterday - sketching it in and doing the background -to-<br/>
