      Dearest Lawrence
      Thank you for all your letters they have been a great comfort to me.  I longed so much to see you yesterday but I should have hated to have left you if I had once embraced you, dear love.

      You really seem to have had a pleasant and successful time.  I am glad - and I hope your lecture at Birmingham went well too with a stimulating audience.  I am [unclear]very[/unclear] interested in what you say of "Leggat" and the Hogarth's, how very gratifying that O. Johnson should be so kindly and friendly.  But then Dandy is such a delightful person I am not in the least surprised.

      Thank you for all your letters

      I longed so much to see you yesterday
      but I should have hated to have
      left you if I had once embraced
      you, dear love.

      You really seem to have had a

      am so glad - and I hope your

      Dearest Lawrence
      Thank you for all your letters they have been a great comfort to me. I longed so much to see you yesterday but I should have hated to have left you if I had once embraced you - dear love.
      You really seem to have had a pleasant and successful time - I am so glad - and I hope your lecture at Birmingham went well too with a stimulating audience. I am very interested in what you say of "Leggat" and the Hogarth's, how very gratifying that O. Johnson should be so kindly and friendly. But then Dandy is such a delightful person I am not inthe least surprised.
