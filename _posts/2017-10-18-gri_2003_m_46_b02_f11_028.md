      Triumph for Sylvia
      (1)
      The quattrocento lover always sinking
      Upon a hill or garden of his country
      In the path of numerous Trionfi,
      Tangled love and erudition
      The flowerd twisting round an aedicule,
      Pompeian in its slender elegance
      And where he dozes with his [unclear]nirion[/unclear]
      He is himself a classic fellow.

      (2)
      The double value of imagination
      Compound of phantasy and order;
      Is drawn from fashions of the hill-town court
      And from the starred tower of history -
      A personages [unclear]lording[/unclear] car appears
      Drawn by stayrs and philosophers.
      The sleeping lover, pillowed on his sleeve,
      Encounters the procession like a key.

      sinking<br/>Upon a hill or garden of his country<br/>In the path of numerous
      Trionfi,<br/>Tangled love and erudition<br/>Like flowers twisting round an aedicule,<br/>Pompeian
      in its slender elegance:<br/>He is himself a classic fellow.<br/>(2)<br/>The
      double  votive of imagination<br/>Compound of fantasy and order;<br/>Is drawn
      from fashions of the hill-town court<br/>And from the starred tower of history.<br/>A
      personage's larding  car appears<br/>Drawn by satyrs and philosophers.<br/>The
      sleeping lover, pillowed on his sleeve,<br/>Encounters the procession like a
      key.<br/>
