      8 XI 1949

      Dearest Sylvia,

      your letter this morning enchanted me - so lively, and dearest creature, so loving, I adore you for it and long to see you.
      I wish that I were in a position to write as fully as I should like but I am in a post office and have a vast amount of work to do. I had to go out at 8.30 this morning. I saw Gainsborough, I [unclear]barter[/unclear] to tell you, and I am definitely reviewing the Kennington Gallery. I shall send you a Telegram with the news on Thursday so do not be alarmed when it appears. I told him frankly I wanted to 'give miss Sleigh a Puff' and he was, first, startled and then charmed. I also have to cover the new London Gallery Show for him

      You are in my thoughts all day long, no matter how busy and rushed I became, as today. Your beauty and your intelligence delight me all times - beautiful life - accepting Minerva,

      I am delighted that you talk about me - I adore that, of course.
      The cake I expect will come later today. I look forward very much to eating it. [unclear]Liural[/unclear] shall close it with me. I hope Yawolla - whose coat is a bit [unclear]singed[/unclear] in places - does not discover it before I get home this evening after [unclear]sundown[/unclear] - you know what He IS!

      You sound very busy with your lectures - I shall be there platonically - a misty lion a few feet [unclear]off[/unclear] the ground, just above the front now.
