      Friday
      Dearest Syvia:
      It has rained since I got up but now the sun is out and I
      hope I shall not get wet when I go out today.  Today my
      cold is rather better so I have a great reluctance to get it
      here again.  I doubt if the weather will have permitted
      you to go to Camden yet, however.  Still you love your
      cartoon to work on, of course.
      I wonder what the estimate for moving your furniture
      will be?
      I had an opportunity for lifemanship at the Mansbridges
      Heather day.  Ian ahd not been to Italy and I was able
      to say--'of course, you saw the symporelli esh?', and
      so on.  As he hadn't it was a victory to Mr. Potter's
      principles.  ('Oh.  You didn't ee it? Umm.)
      Did I tell you Mansbridge is a cocteau admirer?  He
      lent me a book with article about chiries and Mrs.:
      cocteau paintsout that Miro was influenced and Felix the Cat
      film cartoon.
      A book has come from American for me.  It won remandeed
      a rather ordered it for me at the cost of about 35 cents.
      It is Ellas. Henri Ford's Sleep In a Nest of Flower.  Half
      of the owrk reprints The Overturned Lalce--but half is of
      newer poems, some of the fascinating (you kno whow

      Blackheath
      Friday

      Dearest Sylvia:

      It has rained since I got up but now the sun is out and I hope I shall not get wet when I go out today. Today my cold is rather better so I have a great reluctance to get it worse again. I doubt if the weather will have permitted you to go to [unclear]Camber[/unclear] yet, however. Still you have your cartoon to work on, of course.

      I wonder what the estimate for moving your furniture will be?

      I had an opportunity for lifemanship at the Mansbridges the othe day. Ian -.- had been to Italy and I was able to say - 'of course, you saw the signorelli' [unclear]exh[/unclear]?, and so on. As he hadn't it was a victory to Mr Potters' principles. ('oh. You didn't see it? Umm.)

      Did I tell you Mansbridge is a Cocteau admirer? He lent me a book with articles about [unclear] Chinico & Muro[/unclear]: CocteFelix the Cat film cartoons.

      A book has come from America for me. It was remaindered & father ordered it for me at the cost of about 3.5 cents. It is Chas. Henri Ford's Sleep In a Nest of Flowers. Half of the book reprints the Overturned Lake - but half is of newer poems, some of the fascinating (you know how much I like him). Edith Sitwell wrote the introduction which I am nor really happy about: it is noble & some-
