      26 september 1948

      Dearest Sylvia,

      The Tawny Owl is full of your tiers. I can scarcely wait to see it.

      Clifford's view of artists seems to be naine.  They are not all Henry Miller's and Byron's.*  And his prognosis of the future seems to be the result of  Moll Flanders or The Harlot's progress.  Perhaps I exaggerate but so, I think, has Clifford.

      I don't think one can generalize very safely about the capacity to love for a long period, whether the lover is ancient or young.  Don't you think that you and I, as the participants, are the best judges? I remember you once put our love at 10 years.  Even then I protested at so unhopeful an estimate.

      You made an enchanting slip in your letter.  You said you believed in my love 'temporaly' where you meant to write 'temporarily'.  I ask for nothing more, my dearest Sylvia. I love you temporaly.

      * and what about Michael? (in margin)
