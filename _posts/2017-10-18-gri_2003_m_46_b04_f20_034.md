      4 vile ever since. And today it has surpassed itself - the wind is almost a gale and the rain has come down in sheets, with only short intervals - all the morning.
      I have no news otherwise - I finished the picture of [unclear] Lucy [/unclear] and the Landscape - The Redfern have asked me to remove my paintings at my convenience, and I can always fetch one from the Leicester. But I will not do that when I come. Have you fetched my water-colours? You don't answer my letters.
      Have you heard from Leeds? Have you sent 2 to the N.G? What was the Tate advertisement? Have you sent your poem to Sir Osbert? I am so glad that my suggestions about "Evergreen" were useful - I think too it might help to round off that chapter. How much more do you need to so before you
