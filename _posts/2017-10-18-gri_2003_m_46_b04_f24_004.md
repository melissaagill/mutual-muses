      started I believe!! Undeterred RB has written a Strong review again this week.
      M is getting me the canvases they will be ready on the 13th or 14th so I can collect them myself! I don't think one has to collect K. Galleries till this week -
      I'm so glad about Banstead I thought they would - they enjoy you so much!
      I am trying for a job at Rye potteries - I hope I might get some part-time work - Savage told me about it.
       I am so longing to see you, my Apollo - Apollo as Archer at the moment! ah my love. Your presence will show my mistake I love you Sylvia

      13th or 14th so I can collect them myself! I don''t think one has to collect
      K. Galleries till this week.<br/>I''m so glad about Bamstead I thought they
      would. They enjoy you so much!<br/>I am trying for a job at Rye Potteries. I
      hope I might get some part-time work. Savage told me about it.<br/>I am so longing
      to see you, my Apollo - Apollo as Archer at the moment! Ah my love your presence
      will show my mistake. I love you<br/>Sylvia '
