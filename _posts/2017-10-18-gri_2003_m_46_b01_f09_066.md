      25th October, 1948
      Dearest Sylvia,

      If I were a painter I should like to decorate a suite of
      rooms for my lady with the voyage recorded in this poem.  I love
      you, I love you.

      EMBLEMATA AMATORIA

      Along the silver bourn
      A boat for lovers moves
      Steered by the boy of love
      Past willow palaces
      And islands shaped like trophies
      Parting the current's hair.

      And in the boat we lie
      Embracing as we traverse
      The double landscape,
      Lisping among the reeds,
      Escorted by Desire -
      The feathered messenger.

      Swans glide like ambassadors
      Before our boat and doves
      Flutter like warm fans around
      The sunflower on our flag.

      There is a ruined city:
      It is the past, and as we look
      Left over a lawn of lilies
      It burns like Sodom and is gone.

      On the other bank temptation sports
      Alluring livery, a feast
      To honour only one of us,
      Attended by kings and singers.

      But these rejected with a kiss
      We reach a gallant garden
      Where there are mazes, every turn
      Leading to the rose's centre,
      Knot gardens fashioned on your name,
      And peacocks boasting of our love.

      Now Cupid tends the bees,
      Or works with bellows for a wind,
      Or shoots an arrow at a flower:
      Always in the garden are
      A beauty seated at her easel,
      A poet reading as she works.

    annotation_text: "25th October, 1948\nDearest Sylvia,\nIf I were a painter I should
      like to decorate a suite of rooms for my lady with the voyage recorded in this
      poem. I love\nyou, I love you.\n\nEMBLEMATA AMATORIA\n\nAlong the silver bourn\nA
      boat for lovers moves\nSteered by the boy of love\nPast willow palaces\nAnd
      islands shaped like trophies\nParting the current's hair.\n\nAnd in the boat
      we lie\nEmbracing as we traverse\nThe double landscape,\nLisping among the reeds,
      \nEscorted by Desire - \nThe feathered messenger.\n\nSwans glide like ambassadors\nBefore
      our boat and doves\nFlutter like warm fans around\nThe sunflower on our flag.\n\nThere
      is a ruined city:\nIt is the past, and as we look\nLeft over a lawn of lilies\nIt
      burns like Sodom and is gone.\n\nOn the other bank temptation sports\nAlluring
      livery, a feast\nTo honour only one of us,\nAttended by kings and singers.\n\nBut
      these rejected with a kiss\nWe reach a gallant garden\nWhere there are mazes,
      every turn\nLeading to the rose's centre,\nKnot gardens fashioned on your name,\nAnd
      peacocks boasting of our love.\n\nNow Cupid tens the bees, \nOr works with bellows
      for a wind, \nOr shoots an arrow at a flower:\nAlways in the garden are\nA beauty
      seated at her easel, \nA poet reading as she works.\n\nLawrence"
