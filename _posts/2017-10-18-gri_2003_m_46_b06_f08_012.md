      11 August 1953 NG My dearest Sylvia
      Yes - do come on Friday. I am happy you are able to come then.
      Is there a train that gets in the early evening? I suggest
      you come latish because that will give me all Friday to
      get ready, my Friday and Saturday lectures (I'd hate to be too
      busy Saturday morning with you here). My Friday lecture
      is over at 6:00: meet you any time after that, if that suits
      you? I am glad indeed that you are coming, darling.

      Maurice Brockwell came to the NG to my Van Eyck lecture
      just now and was full of ire (tho' rather sweetly expressed)
      afterwards. Otherwise it went fairly well, I suppose,
      tho' I feel terribly out-of-touch with ISC Flemist art.

      I'll write to M about when he wants to see V Pasmore.
      A sculpture exhibition is a good idea, I think.

      You mentioned that Dawn had been again, how are your
      paintings coming? I liked what I saw very much - all
      three of them.

      I am glad Diana Imber feels pleasant towards me, because
      she did seem to me very nice & a good friend to you.

      It is 2:15 (after the lecture) and I want something to eat
      before going home - so, goodbye for now. I am impatient
      for your next letter and - especially - for FRIDAY.
      I love you
      Lawrence

      NG 11 August 1953

      My dearest Sylvia
      Yes - do come on Friday. I am happy you are able to come then. Is there a train that gets in in the early evening? I suggest you come latish because that will give me all Friday to get ready my Friday and Saturday lectures (I'd hate to be too busy Saturday morning with you here). My Friday lecture is over at 6.00 : meet you any time after that, if that suits you? I am glad indeed that you are coming, darling.

      Maurice Brockwell came to the NG to my Van Eyck lecture just now and was full of ire (tho' rather sweetly expressed) afterwards. Otherwise it went fairly well, I suppose, tho' I feel terribly out-of-touch with ISC Flemish art.

      I'll write to M about when he wants to see V Pasmore. A sculpture exhibition is a good idea, I think.

      You mentioned that Dawn had been again : how are your paintings coming? I liked what I saw very much - all three of them.

      I am glad Diana [unclear]imber[/unclear] feels pleasant towards me, because she did seem to me very nice + a good friend to you.

      It is 2.15 (after the lecture) and I want something to eat before going home - so, goodbye for now. I am impatient for your next letter and - especially - for FRIDAY
      love you
      Lawrence
