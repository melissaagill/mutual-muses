      Thank you for your long letter, my darling. I am happy you like the play. Yes, as you suggest, I have not had time for my story. Only 500 words, at the moment. (It is terribly hard to be simple and popular. I'd rather write a deep sonnet any day).

      I follow your explanation of Daphne but I don't think that it was all in your story. Perhaps you will get it in. I feel your impatience with the poor girls has led you to suppress their real suffering so they are spared pain at the price of remaining trivial.

      Yes, my darling, that would be wonderful. June 8 or 9 would be fine. Come then, my love: whichever day you like and for as long as you can.

      I am glad your garden and your art, your art and your garden are doing so well.

      Sorry to hear about Mark Boxer and Granta. How ridiculous. What does '[unclear]rusticated[/unclear]' mean? Is it bad? I mean, very bad?

      Your description of Tiny is marvellous, clinical and metaphoric at the same time.

      You are so right about [unclear]Paul de Limbourg and May[/unclear]. Yes. Yes, indeed.

      School lecture, today, so I must get to town. I am always up by 8.00 nowadays. It does make a difference to the amount of work I get through - it really does. And I can write a longer letter.

      Love you
      Lawrence
      P.S. I am reading all 5 of Meratti's operas on Frank's advice. I'm loving it.

      Thank you for your long letter, my darling. I am happy you like the play. Yes, as you suggest, I have not had time for my story. Only 500 words, at the moment. (it is terribly hard to be simple and popular. I'd rather write a deep sonnet any day)
      I follow your explanation of Daphne but I don't think that it was all in your story. Perhaps you will get it in. I feel your impatience with the poor girls has led you to suppress their real suffering so they are spared pain at the price of remaining trivial. Yes, my darling, that would be wondeful. June 8 or 9 would be fine. Come then, my love: whichever day you like and for as long as you can. I am glad your garden and your art , your art & your garden are doing so well. Sorry to hear about Mark Boxer and Granta. How ridiculous. What does [unclear]'rusticated'[/unclear] mean? Is it bad? I mean, very bad? Your description of Tiny is marvellous, clinical and metaphoric at the same time. You are so right about Pal de Limbaury and May. Yes - Yes, indeed. School lecture, today, so I must get to town. I am always up by 8.00 nowadays. It does make a difference to the amount of work I get through - it really does. And I can write a longer letter. I love you Lawrence
