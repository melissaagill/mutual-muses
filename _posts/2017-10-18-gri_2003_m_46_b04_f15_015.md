      will it be convenient if I put the
      picture on the 10:10 train to
      Charing Cross, arriving at about 12:15
      I understand you ask a porter to
      collect the picture from the train
      for you, then either you, or he
      sign a paper.  If you would rather
      that I put it on a later train
      let me know - let me know also
      what the sending fees for the
      "Womens International" are and
      I will send you a P.O.
      Yesterday I finished cutting out
      my new suit - it most complicated
      but I think it should look well.
      I hope to machine some of it to-
      day - as well as marking in "Knosey
      Gates" on the map for Tiny!
      I do hope my dearest Lion is well
      and not too Tired - did you remem-
      ber to ring up Hash?
      I long to see you - I hope I shall
      soon; dear love, devine poet -
      I adore you, I love you
      Sylvia

      will it be convenient if I put the picture on the 10.10 tram to chasing Cross, arriving at about 12.15. I understand you ask a poster to colect the picture from the train for you. then either you, or he sign  a paper. If you would rather that I put it on a later train let me know - let me know also what the sending fees for the "womens International" are and I will send you a P.O.
      Yesterday I finished cutting out my new suit - it must be compicated but I think it should look well. I hope to machine some of it today - as well as maasking in "Kursey qates" on the map for Luis!
      I do hope my dearest Lion is well and not too tired - did Jon remember to ring up [unclear]Hash[/unclear]?
      I long to see you - I hope I shall soon; dear love, divine poet - I adore you, I love you
