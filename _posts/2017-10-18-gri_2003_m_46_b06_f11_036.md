      Sunday
      Dearest Sylvia
      I have not heard from Dannatt but I think it is likely that I shall hear from him tomorrow (Monday): assuming I do I will contact you and South at once.
      I hope that life at Pett is not too disturbing. How is C preparing to face civilian life? Is your portrait of Mrs Hake going well: that should be pleasant, a labour of love.
      Today I lecture, go to the Ben Uri gallery for Jewish child art (it being Jewish I can see the gallery on Sunday): then John and Magda and I are going to see my favourite film Build My Gallows High (Kirk Douglas and Robert Mitchum). It is on in the Edgware Road.
      David Sylvester was charming last night. He told me a bit about the ICA background which may be useful to me in the subcommittee. He recommends I try Spender with a film article for Encounter.
      Glad you enjoyed Genevieve and I thought your comments on it were very good. I can't say I liked it beyond the fact that it fitted my theories so exactly.
      My poor mother not only has Molly here (at Wimbledon) with a bad leg but she has a friend of hers recovering from an ear infection. (Molly seems jealous of Ricky's sickness, wouldn't you say?) No wonder poor Mother has migraine every day or so with two women on her hands. And father does not like having Molly here much ...
      Magda moves on Tuesday to Cleveland Square. I hope we follow her soon with our move. I like the idea of Chepstow Road so very much.
      A telephone costs (basic rate) 9 pounds 1 shilling a year. That is still 11 pounds less than you said. You are trying to do a Tiny on me.
      I am as short of news a s I am of time. The film tonight is my only play in weeks. See you soon darling
      I love you

      Today I lecture, go to Ben Uri gallery for Jewish child art (being Jewish I can see the gallery on Sunday): then John and Magda and I are going to see my favorite film Build My Gallows High ( Kirk Douglas and Robert Mitchum.
      David Sylvester was charming last night. He told me a bit about the ICA back round which may be useful to me in the subcommittee.  He recommends I try Spender with a film article Encounter.
      Glad you enjoyed Genevieve and I thought your comments on it were good. I can't say I liked it beyond the fact that it fitted my theories so exactly.
      My poor Mother not only has Molly here (at Wimbledon) with a bad leg,,  but she has a friend of hers recovering from an ear operation.

      square. I hope we follow her soon with our move. I Like the idea of Chepstow
      Road very much. A telephone costs (basic rate) 9 pounds. That is  11 pounds
      less than you said. You are trying to do a Tiny on me. I am as short of news
      as I am of time. The film tonight is my only play in weeks. See you soon, Darling.
      I love you, adore you.<br/>Lawrence<br/>'
