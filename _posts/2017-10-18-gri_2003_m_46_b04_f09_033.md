      wonderful. And the fates in the fete acting as a chorus is a fine economy in
      my opinion. And of course, as you say, Katherine of Aragon as Henry''s Death:

      Your suggestions about how to treat Henry are absol-
      utely first-rate.  How can you suggest they are trite?
      The monarch a la Hoyle is a brilliant and appropriate
      device, linking modern and 16th century cosmogonies.
      Wonderful, wonderful.  And the fates in the fete act-
      ing as a chorus is a fine economy in my opinion.  And,
      of course, as you say, Katharine of Aragon as Henry's
      Death:  it is ingenious and, now you have discovered it,
      inevitable.  A brilliant group of ideas:  I do congrat-
      ulate you, I do indeed.

      I hope M gets the job:  I should have thought M
      would enjoy Cambridge.  Young people (sic) with thom he
      can engage in endless solemn discourse.  A dog's dream
      of heaven I had supposed.

      I cannot think why the doctors allow Doris to linger.
      It is making a molehill out of a mountain.  This kind of
      thing proves once again that they are sadistic and sup-
      erstitious.  Why not put an end to her shameful perfor-
      mance?

      I am glad the Lion and Unicorn (or the S*pavilion) is
      to stay.  It will not make a very suitable picture gal-
      lery I think without some internal alterations.  Still,
      the pleasant thing is it is to stay.  As for the Shot
      Tower what fools everybody is about it:  it's mediocre.
      You know the Skylon used to be considered phallic:  the
      latest suggestion is that it symbolizes a nation exist-
      ing without visible means of support.

      By the way I must quote for my cat a few Venetian lines
      from Ezra Pound (canto iii):

      I sat on the Dogana's steps
      For the gondolas cost too much, that year,
      And there were not 'those girls', there was one face,
      And the Buccentere twenty yards off, howling 'Stretti',
      And the lit cross-beams, that year, in the Morosini,
      And peacocks in Kor's house, or there may have been.
      Gods float in the azure air,
      Bright gods and Tuscan, back before dew was shed.

      Your suggestion about how to treat Henry are absol-
      utely first-rate. How can you suggest they are trite?
      The monarch a lo Hoyle is a brilliant and appropriate
      device, linking modern and 16th century cosmogonies.
      Wonderful, wonderful. And the fates in the fete act-
      ing as a chorus is a fine economy in my opinion. And,
      of course, as you say, Katharine of Aragon as Henry's
      Death: it is ingenious and, now you have discovered it,
      inevitable. A brilliant group of ideas: I do congrat-
      ulate you, I do indeed.

      I hope M. gets the job: I should have thought M.
      would enjoy Cambridge. Young people (sic) with whom he
      can engage in endless solemn discourse. A dog's dream
      of heaven I had supposed.

      I cannot think why the doctors allow Doris to linger.
      It is making a molehill out of a mountain. This kind of
      thing proves once again that they are sadistic and sup-
      erstitious. Why not put an end to her shameful perfor-
      mance?

      I am glad the Lion and Unicorn (or the S-pavilion) is
      to stay. It will not make a very suitable picture gal-
      lery I think without some internal alterations. Still,
      the pleasant thing is it is to stay. As for the Shot
      Tower what fools everybody is about it: it's mediocre.
      You know the Skylon used to be considered phallic: the
      latest suggestion is that it symbolises a nation exist-
      ing without visible means of support.

      By the way, I must quote for my cat a few Venetian lines
      from Ezra Pound (canto iii):

      I sat on the Dogana's steps
      For the gondolas cost too much, that year,
      And there were not 'those girls', there was one face,
      And the Buccentoro twenty yards off, howling 'Stretti',
      And the lit cross-beams, that year, in the Morosini,
      And peacocks in Kore's house, or there may have been.
      Gods float in the azure air,
      Bright gods and Tuscan, back before dew was shed.

      Dearest Sylvia, I adore, adore, adore, adore, you.
      Lawrence
