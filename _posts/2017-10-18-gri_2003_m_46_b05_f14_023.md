      or perhaps one should say realistic.
      However I will bring "my toy" to London and see what Christies thinks of him - I need not necessarily sell him - I don't want to but if I know what he is worth I shall have a feeling of more security. I shall also see about [unclear]selling[/unclear] the two "Hepple White" arm-chairs when I get back, and if possible the Rose wood card-table. These are things I don't need nor prize very much.
      I wonder how the discussion when it sounds as if it might be interesting I hope it was. I shall be most interested to hear about it.
      I hope that you have managed to get [unclear]anything[/unclear] slides from the Science museum for your Wednesday "Railway Station". I wish I could come. I'm sure it will be very good. I'm sure they'll all enjoy it. I wonder how many of the men will come!
      By the way, in case you know nothing about it, I shouldn't go to town on Friday morning as there will be the King's funeral procession and every thing will be diverted including pedestrians!
