      19-2-53 Midnight Pett (22 Hills Road Cambridge)
      Dearest Lawrence,
      Owing to my vile illness I
      have had the most awful rush -
      and have just finished but all
      is ready for the morrow - up at 6!
      I am so sorry that I cannot
      come in on my way to-morrow -
      a glimpse of you would have been
      so pleasent as I am so near -
      I enclose the pound and hope that
      my not coming did not inconvience
      you. You see I think it most un-
      likely that we shall be able
      to get in another picture! In fact I
      shall breathe a sigh of relief if we
      can get them all in. I gather
      also that it would have cost me
      a good deal more as it is a larger
      detour from the Kensington route which
      I did not realize. So I think
      it would be best if I get Chase

      Dearest Lawrence,
      Owing to my vile illness I
      have had the most awful rash--
      and have just finished but all
      is ready for the morrow--up at 6!
      I am so sorry that I cannot
      come in on my way tomorrow and
      a glimpse of you would have been
      so pleasant as I am so near.
      I enclose the pound and hope that
      my not coming did not inconvenience
      you.  You see I think it most u-
      likely that we shall be able
      to get in another picture!  In fact I
      shall breathe a sigh of relief if we
      can get them all in.  I gather
      also that it would have cost me
      a good deal more as it is a longer
      detour from the Kensington route which
      I did not realize.  So I think
      it would be best if I get Chase
