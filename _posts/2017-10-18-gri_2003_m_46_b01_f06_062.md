      Here's a poem I have just written.  It is meant to follow on from the earlier two I sent you.

      On this sublunar island
      Where the bluest sea
      Whispers from imported shells
      Where bastards of clouds
      Fidget and blink the sun
      I think of Sylvia
      Beyond the white cusps of the waves
      In the Sienese evening
      Among the angels set in panes of gold

      In earlish astronomy sublunar 'atmosphere' was stale and imperfect while beyond the moon's orbit was pure aether. This is supposed to say that England is sublunar while Italy (by the bluest sea) is the ideal mixtures of the elements.  Neo-platonic ideas as in the other two pieces. Angels not necessarity Christian are symbolic of ideal creatures.

      I love you
      Lawrence

         Here's a poem I have just written.  It is meant to
      follow on from the earlier two I sent you.
               On this sublunar island
               Where the bluest sea
               Whispers from imported shells
               Where bastards of clouds
               Fidget and blink the sun
               I think of Sylvia
               Beyond the white cusps of the waves
              In the Sienese evening
              Among the angels set in panes of gold

      In earlish astronomy sublunar 'atmosphere' was stale and
      imperfect while beyond the moon's orbit was pure aether.
      This is supposed to say that England is sublunar while
      Italy (by the bluest sea) is the ideal mixture of the
      elements.  Neo-platonic ideas as in the other two pieces.
      Angels not necessarity Christian are symbolic of ideal
      creatures.

         I love you
                     Lawrence
