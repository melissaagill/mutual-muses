      is fatal, or a sitting: get
      away clumsy giants, don't dine
      on the parvenue delicacy
      of my lakes, ferns, and vine.

      You open books as if you were
      in a prison library:
      non-fiction, non-fiction, beware.
      Rather than unscrew the stopper
      You hit the battle on a gable
      and lose all there is to drink.

      You never stop to think?

      You bastards, be small,
      stop stretching - you make a cross
      that bends the walls of my house.
      Bean-stalks are bow-ties in
      hands like hams. Must all
      you lift fall, he snapped, stove in?
