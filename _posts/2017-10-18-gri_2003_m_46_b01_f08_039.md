      work i have made and I must say I am very struck by the detail as well as the
      irregular mlale. It is especially rich, as you know, in sculpture, and I saw
      also of course the splendid Oapte House, and the fine support for the central
      tower - you remember, de ones and inverted ones. How exciting spatially it makes
      more and transepts. Some of these observations make rather familiar reading
      I'm afraid but I am genuinely excited by Gothic for the first time.<br/>Naturally
      I understand about the dates 30th or 1st. Let me know which so that i can book
      in time. Sartre on 78l Route? I shall go back to Wimbledon on see 27th, next

      my return until then.<br/>I hope that my next news of you will be more cheering
