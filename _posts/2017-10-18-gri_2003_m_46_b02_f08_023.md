      On Friday I saw some more Hogarths and two early Gainsboroughs (one on loan from the Cook col.) at the Fitzwilliam. Charles drove me there with Molly and Eric: it was charming and such a useful opportunity for a lion. King's College Chapel is now absolutely cleaned and I managed, for the first time, to see Wren's Pembroke Chapel. We saw Waltham Cross on the way.

      Congratulations on starting the Dutch painters. The job is a great bore, I know, but the money will be useful.

      I was amused with Ted: he told Paul that he (Ted) was very pleased with my hair that time (which I illustrated in a vignette). I have been there since then and, again, with the most satisfactory results. Ted seems to know what to do now.

      Yesterday I went to Kensington Palace and, at last, saw for myself the Kent decorations: my feelings are mixed. The King's Staircase (illustrated in British Architects and Craftsmen) is good but elsewhere he is very feeble as a painter.

      Thank you, darling, for your letters. Thank you, too, for telling me a date when I shall see you again. Your lion will be very industrious and greet you with amazing news of chapters written, rooms dusted, and canvases ready.

      I hope your weekend with Peploe and your tea with Miss Cave were amusing. I had rather a gay saturday and I thought of you often.

      I love you, dearest Sylvia, I love you and shall write again immediately. I love you,
      Lawrence

      II
      On Friday I saw some more Hogarths and two early
      Gainsboroughs (one on loan from the Cook col.) at
      the Fitzwilliam.  Charles drove me there with Molly
      and Eric: it was charming and such a useful oppor-
      tunity for a lion.  King's College Chapel is now
      absolutely cleaned and I managed, for the first time,
      to see Wren's Pembroke Chapel.  We saw Waltham
      Cross on the way.
      Congratulations on starting the Dutch painters.
      The job is a great bore, I know, but the money will
      be useful.
      I was amused with Ted: he told Paul that he (Ted)
      was very pleased with my hair that time (which I illus-
      trated in a vignette).  I have been there since
      then and, again, with the most satisfactory results.
      Ted seems to know what to do now.
      Yesterday I went to Kensington Palace and, at last,
      saw for myself the Kent decorations: my feelings are
      mixed.  The King's Staircase (illustrated in British
      Architects and Craftsmen) is good but elsewhere he is
      very feeble as a painter.
      Thank you, darling, for your letters.  Thank you,
      too, for telling me a date when I shall see you again.
      Your lion will be very industrious and greet you with
      amazing news of chapters written, rooms dusted, and
      canvases ready.
      I hope your weekend with Peploe and your tea with
      Miss Cave were amusing.  I had rather a gay Saturday
      and I though of you often.
      I love you, dearest Sylvia, I love you and shall
      write again immediately.  I love you,
      Lawrence
