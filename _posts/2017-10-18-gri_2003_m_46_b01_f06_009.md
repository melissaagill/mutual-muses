      (london) Red paint grinding through Kenington.
      The cricket ball sun plops into the sump.
      Sweating as the thunder bumps
      Like sculpture in the rhododendrons
      Shapeless purple folk look out
      As a stain walks down the street

      I wish there was a gun beneath my pillow
      Only a window and the curtains
      Giving softly as a willow
      (It is the sky of a city, it has stars)
      Tired but I don't want to sleep
      Listen to the aeolian stir of ears

      The curtains give a ball of hair
      Blows under th ebed and there is
      A scribble of flowers and smudges of smoke.
      Blue prongs of flame jump from the ring
      And tremble like ferns fidgeted by wind
      Water shudders in the cistern.


      (pett) Like escalators coming in and in
      The dawn waves hit shore hit shore
      A silver tube of paint lies like a fish
      Beside a window with a country view
      Across the field where tides of wind
      Come in to break among the orchard

      Beyond the noncommittal sundial
      Nude to the waist a hero scythes
      While Philomel stutters in the trees
      Inscrutably sweet she charms the day
      With liquid hornpipes and the grass
      Shivers and falls the silver edge

      Dew falls from a purple sheath
      Among white nodules of wild strawberry
      I reflected on the past of nightingales
      Mourning perhaps us with a silver tear
      her music was sugar in the dark green day
      Like jewels in a Tintoretto garden

      Remembering some pastoral themes:
      Image the city in this viscous sump
      Where rotting branches throb and ferns shrivel,
      Colin is busy as a Book of Hours,
      Adam's decapitated head sinks in the flowers
      Slashes by petals his hair a gold font

      Twitching panting branded sheep populate a hill
      The slim fox vanishes in a tent of grass
      The first bat twangs from a contorted oak
      Above a clogged pond, hoofed cake, and patted.

      (red paint-
      a tram)

      -1-                 [7-7-48]

      Red paint grinding through Kenington
      The cricket ball sun plops into the sump.
      Sweating as the thunder bumps
      Like sculpture in the rhododendrons
      Shapeless purple folk look out
      As a stain walks down the street

      I wish there was a gun beneath my pillow
      Only a window and the curtains
      Giving softly as a willow
      (It is the sky of a city, it has stars)
      Tired but I don't want to sleep
      Listen to the aeolian stir of cars

      The curtains give and a ball of hair
      Blows under the bed and there is
      A scribble of flowers and smudges of smoke.
      Blue prongs of flame jump from the ring
      And tremble like ferns fidgetted by wind
      Water shudders in the cistern.

      Like escalators coming in and in
      The dawn waves hit shore hit shore
      A silver tube of paint lies like a fish
      Beside a window with a country view
      Across the fields where tides of wind
      Come in to break among the orchard

      Beyond the non-commital sundial
      Nude to the waist a hero scythes
      While Philomel stutters in the trees
      Inscrutably sweet she charms the day
      With liquid hornpipes and the grass
      Shivers and falls to the silver edge

      Dew falls from a purple sheath
      Among white nodules of wild strawberry.
      I reflected on the past of nightingales
      Mourning perhaps us with a silver tear
      Her music was sugar in the dark green day
      Like jewels in a Tintoretto garden

      Remembering some pastoral themes:
      Image the city in this viscous sump
      Where rotting  branches throb and ferns shrivel,
      Colin is busy as a Book of Hours,
      Adam's decapitated head sinks in flowers
      Slashed by petals his hair a gold font

      Twitching panting branded sheep populate a hill
      The slim fox vanishes in a tent of grass
      The first bat twangs from a contorted oak
      Above a clogged pond, hoofed caked and patted.

      Red paint grinding through Kenington
      The cricket ball sun plops into the sump.
      Sweating as the thunder bumps
      Like sculpture in the rhododendrons
      Shapeless purple folk look out
      As a strain walks down the street

      I wish there was a gun beneath my pillow
      Only a window and the curtains
      Giving softly as a willow
      (It is the sky of a city, it has stars)
      Tired but I don't want to sleep
      Listen to the aeolian stir of cars

      The curtains give and a ball of hair
      Blows under the bed and there is
      A scribble of flowers and smudges of smoke.
      Blue prongs of flame jump from the ring
      And tremble like ferns fidgeted by wind
      Water shudders in the cistern.

      Like escalators coming in and in
      The dawn waves hit shore hit shore
      A sliver tube of paint lies like a fish
      Beside a windows with a country view
      Across the fields where tides of wind
      Cone in to break among the orchard

      Beyond the non-committal sundial
      Nude to the waist a hero scythes
      While Philomel stutters in the trees
      Inscrutably sweet she charms the day
      With liquid hornpipes and the grass
      Shivers and falls to the silver edge

      Dew falls from a purple sheath
      Among white nodules of wild strawberry.
      I reflected on the past of nightingales
      Mourning perhaps us with a silver tear
      Her music was sugar in the dark green day
      Like jewels in a Tintoretto garden
