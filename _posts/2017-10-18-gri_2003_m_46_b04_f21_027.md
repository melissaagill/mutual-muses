      2  to 'The New Statesman'?
      The Times has a column about the
      Restoration of Hogarth's Chiswick
      House - do you want it? I hope
      you have got in touch with Hodders
      by the way.

      Another thing I wanted to tell you
      Clifford tells me that Clegg - I
      don't know how spelt is a suffix
      name for the horse - fly - you remember
      they come from that film we saw
      at Greenwich. I thought the name
      very suitable with that meaning.
      They, the cleggs, attack a random without
      reason like the horsefly.

      I am so glad you liked the
      drawing and that you find the
      self-portrait satisfactory. I hope
      I shall be able to refine the
      colour ad tone somewhat when
      I have painted in the gown.

      2    to "The New Statesman"?
      The times has a column about the
      Restoration of Hogarth's Chiswick
      House--do you want it?  I hope
      you have got in touch with Hodders
      by the way.
      Another thing I wanted to tell you
      Clifford tells me that Clegg--I
      don't know how spelt is a Sussex
      name for the hourse-fly--you remember
      they come from that firm we saw
      as Greenwich.  I thought the name
      very suitable with that meaning.
      They (the Cleggs) attack a random without
      reason like the horse-fly.
      I am so glad you liked the
      drawing and that you find the
      self-portrait satisfactory.  I hope
      I shall be able to refine the
      colour and tone somewhat when
      I have painted in the gown.
