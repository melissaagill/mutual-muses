      9-10-51

      Dearest Lawrence,

      Thank you for your letter, I couldn't find your article in Art News this week - I suppose it will be next. I will certainly put my pre-conscious to words on the problem of the next article. I shall be sorting out cards and pictures for my next lecture, 29th, within a day or two, and then, if not before, something will occur to me. I'm so glad that the Gainsbourgh wants another. I'm so pleased to hear that you have applied to Norwich - I hope something will soon come of your efforts. I am glad that you have written to Lines.

      Fancy lecturing to 400 - it seems almost incredible - traders too, good heavens! It doesn't sound a very stimulating audience.

      Whose party was it that stopped so abruptly? Anyway you ought to have caught the last train..
