      4. fortunately Tiny - or thank heaven Mary-Jane to hear Clifford lecture on the Sitwells at Fairlight - it was splendid -I did enjoy it. I adore Su [unclear]Osturart[/unclear] - he is my house-hold God - how I should love to meet him! I'm sure he would be so pleased to see your poems because he loves poetry and creative gestures.
      (Clifford received his books safely.)
      I was so heartened, because after the lecture we talked to Mr Handley - who in the discussion surpassed himself in a  long and wonderfully involved speech. I wish I were good at short-hand as this would have been a comic masterpiece, but with a good deal of sense in it too - he started by saying he had been reading a book whose author and title he had forgotten - ! only of course he took infinitely long to say this
