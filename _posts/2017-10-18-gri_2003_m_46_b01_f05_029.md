      The owl has made it, only
      Just in time, first light arrives
      On time, and lights up lonely
      Cottages on hills, their roofs,

      Then little mullioned windows, beams
      On much twined porches, brightly
      Returns color to the garden, and schemes,
      By rising higher, to make sight-ly

      Even the ruin, fallen in,
      Where the owl made it, just
      In time, his feathers settling
      After an entrance which disturbed the dust.

      Phoebus' beams catch chimney pots
      Which fifteen minutes earlier
      The owl's wing grazing had found almost hot.
      Farmers wake up, burlier

      Than the elegants their wives dreamed
      In beds soft as the inside
      Of an owl's wing. Light has streamed
      On them nude and now like owls' eyes they hide

      From light their bodies - by means of linen.
      Dead mice are epitaphs on stars.
      The owl has got back to his ruin
      As others have to battlement and high barn,

      To hollow tree and [unclear]grot[/unclear].
      Owls (great eyes learned in the subtle half
      Tones of evening and midnight's blot)
      Lovely and strong by night at whom day laughs.

    clean_transcription: The owl has made it, only<br/>Just in time, first light arrives<br/>On
      time, and lights up lonely<br/>Cottages on hills, their roofs,<br/><br/>Then
      little mullioned windows, beams<br/>On much twined porches, brightly<br/>Returns
      colour to the garden, and schemes,<br/>By rising higher, to make slightly<br/><br/>Even
      the ruin, fallen in,<br/>Where the owl made it, just<br/>In time, his feathers
      settling <br/>After an entrance which disturbed the dust.<br/><br/>Phoebus'
      beams catch chimney pots<br/>Which fifteen minutes earlier<br/>The owl's wing
      grazing had found almost hot.<br/>Farmers wake up, burlier<br/><br/>Then the
      elegants their wives dreamed<br/>In beds soft as the inside<br/>Of an owl's
      wing.  Light has streamed<br/>On them nude and now like owls' eyes they hide<br/><br/>From
      light their bodies - by means of linen.<br/>Dead mice are epitaphs on stars.<br/>The
      owl has got back to his ruin<br/>As others have to battlement and high barn,<br/><br/>To
      hollow tree and grot<br/>Owls (great eyes learned in the subtle half<br/>Tones
      of an evening and midnight's blot)<br/>Lovely and strong by night at whom day
      laughs.<br/><br/>
