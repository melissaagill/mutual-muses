      South [unclear] Kenninzten [/unclear]
      Dearest Sylvia
      I am writing this letter just [unclear] by the Imperial Institute (where the Washburg Institute lives [/unclear] and where we had, do you remember, our examinations?
      I do hope that your [unclear] interesting tours [/unclear], which seem to have been formidible, has not exhausted you.
      Unfortunately I was unable to go to the [unclear] Barnard [/unclear] party, owing to [unclear] A1A [/unclear] business.  I am seeing Robert today, not last Tuesday, owing to a change of plan.
      T6 AIA selection committee for the summer show will be on 22nd June.  Owing to your lion's paws being all hind-paws I was unable to frame my head properly and was forced to leave it out of the women's show.  I am so sorry.  The other pictures are safely submitted now, however.
      i am waiting also on poems about Revaldo and Armida and the profile.  Full face portraits, as well as the others.
      [unclear] Charles [/unclear], you will be sorry to hear, is better and lecturing again.
      I have not reviewed the [unclear] Tanguy [/unclear] but am going to review a new [unclear] Kandinski [/unclear] exhibition-- much more interesting, as [unclear] Tanguy [/unclear] is rather dull.
      Although I have not written for days I seem to have little news-- except, of course, that i love you.
      When you come you will be able to bathe all you want.  It took the plumbers 3 hours including work on the outer walls but all is well now, the bath is fresh and empty.
      I have read All the King's Horses (tell [unclear] Tiny [/unclear] I liked it very much) and seen the film which is not so good but not without merit.  We should be able to see [unclear] OOA [/unclear] locally soon.
      I love you.  (write again)

    annotation_text: 2 vi 1950 South Kensington Dearest Sylvia I am writing this letter
      just at the imperial institute (where the Warburg Institute lives) and where
      we had, do you remember, our examinations? I do hope that your interesting [unclear][/unclear]
      which seems to have been formidable, has not exhausted you. Unfortunately I
      was unable to go to the Bonnard party, owing to A/A business. I am seeing Robert
      today, not last Tuesday, owing to a change of plan. The A/A selection committee
      for the summer show will be on 22nd June. Owing to your lion's paws being all
      hind-paws I was unable to frame my head properly and was forced to leave it
      out of the women's show. I am so sorry. The other pictures are safely submitted
      now, however. I am working also on poems about Rinaldo and Armida and the profile-full
      face portraits, as well as the others. Charles, you will be sorry to hear, is
      better and lecturing again. I have not reviewed the Tanguy but am going to review
      a new Kandinski exhibition-much more interesting, as Tanguy is rather dull.
      Although I have not written for days I seem to have little news-except, of course,
      that I love you. When you come you will be able to bath all you wish. It took
      the plumber 3 hours including work on the outer walls but all is well now. The
      bath is fresh and empty. Have read All the King's Horses ([unclear][/unclear]Tiny
      liked it very much) and seen the film which is not so good but not without merit.
      We shall be able to see DOA locally soon. I love you - (write again) Lawrence
