      Yesterday, somewhere in the neighborhood of Southbank between [Pedcar} and Middleboro I saw that one of the steel works has a distinguished monument - a vast pylon of glittering steel, support a disproportionately small box with a clock in it, and, at the base of the pylon, a suite of armor.  Behind it, beyond the high wire [jest], the usual industrial ruin stretches away - with mushrooms of orange fire leaping up every row and again and a patina of soot that gives everything (except the monument)_that 'before cleaning' look.

      I find my attention often wandering, just now, to the possibility of writing a prose - work, other than critical, I mean.  Every now and again in letters to you I find I venture on experimental descriptive passages and my reading of Henry James, at [St. Albans], remained in my mind to be sired by Sir [Oslert's] ravishing complicated prose-style.

      I adore you my beautiful lover and long to see you again. Although it is such a little time since we were together I long to see you again, and am most impatient.

      I love you

      Lawrence
