      Sunday
      From my bedroom I can see, on a level with my first floor window, a splash of strong red. They are - roses. They have climbed up a holly tree and [unclear]aratkes [/unclear] tree and have burgeoned there high above even their [unclear]excellent[/unclear][unclear]sisters[/unclear] on the trellis.
      It is eleven o 'clock in the morning now. I wonder what you are doing? Cooking very likely. How are preparations for the journey going? There is no need to take any books: if you want any to read in Italy you can get what you want in Paris - French, American, or even English publications. A good English-American book-shop is in the Rue Eaufflat, on a corner, on the right when you walk up toward the Pantheon. I cannot find the notes I made in Paris about restaurants: but since you will not be using student facilities in the short time you are there (it would not be economical in any case Michael would not tolerate such eating conditions, I imagine) it doesn't much matter. You can fibdscores of restaurants. There is a cheap typical one in the Rue Racine itself I remember.
