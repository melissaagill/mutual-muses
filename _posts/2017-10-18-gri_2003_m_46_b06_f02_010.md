      Le Plairis was exactly what it thought it would be
      and fits exactly with my article. I began to think that
      my guess was right (at one time I wondered if I had been
      a little fancy). What gave me worst plairis was the
      photography: the camera was amazingly mobile, never
      still for a second.
      Yesterday I bought my 'X-Mas' trousers. Not exact-
      ly within the money my father gave me, unfortunately...
      They are dark of the very darkest grey - with a zip-
      fly. They were a little lavy but the waist was right: so
      they are being adjusted and I shall pick them up this
      afternoon.
      I have nearly finished my Elegy for 2 [unclear]levels[/unclear].
      I am not sure what it needs: one or 2 more 'weighty'
      lines should do it. I want to avoid a rhetorical
      climax.
      The train has just drawn into Waterloo so
      I shall close this letter now and post it at Chas-
      ing X. (The Times lecture is a new one, about
      his watercolors of which a new group are on view -
      so I could not continue this at the Tate.)
      I hope you will soon be better.
      I love love love you
      Lawrence

      as I have some
      work to do.

    annotation_text: "le Plaisir was exactly what I thought it would be and fits exactly
      into my article.  I begin to think that my guess was right (at one time I wondered
      if I had been a little fancy).  What gave me most plaisir was the photography:
      the camera was amazingly mobile, never still for a second. \n\nYesterday I bought
      my 'X-mas' trousers. Not exactly within the money my father gave me, unfortunately...
      \ They are [unclear]darks[/unclear] of the very darkest grey - with a zip fly.
      \ They were a little long but the waist was right: so they are being adjusted
      and I shall pick them up this afternoon. \n\nI have nearly finished my Elegy
      for 2 Uncles.  I'm not sure what it needs: one or 2 more 'weighty' lines should
      do it. I want to avoid a rhetorical climax. \n\nThe train has just drawn into
      Waterloo so I shall close this letter now and post it at Charing X. (The Turner
      lecture is a new one, about his watercolours of which a new group are on view
