      Blackheath: Saturday evening [8-12-52]
      My dearest Sylvia
      Wonderful. I expect you on Saturday 13th. Tell me exactly when in the afternoon and I will meet you, my love. That will give us a week together with very few tiresome duties. If you can see your Aunt on the [unclear]TG[/unclear] on Thursday 18th that would be most convenient.
      I hope you were able to get on with your x-mas cards in the other evening. I have three of the TG's best cards for you: two of [unclear]Tissat [/unclear] and one of Stubbs. These seemed to me the most suitable and they are the most expensive.
      I am most interested to hear that you have another still life in mind. I like the sound of The Dressing Table immensely. Let me know your new project when it is sufficiently clear in your mind. I will make notes for your catalogue before you come. I want it to be evocative as well as descriptive. I must not imprison you in one critic's view of you, so I must be allusive as well as introductory, yet without loss of clarity. That, as I see it, is what is required of me.
      You are right that this is the weather for still life - not landscape. There has been a bad fog in London since Thursday night. Today it has been practically impenetrable (to sight, I mean). Thick, dirty, greasy, sour, in texture - but pictorially fascinating in its

      Saturday evening

      My dearest Sylvia
      Wonderful. I expect you on Saturday 13th. Tell me
      exactly when in the afternoon and I will meet you, my love.
      That will give us a week together with very few tiresome
      duties. If you can see your aunt at the TG on Thursday 18th
      that would be most convenient.

      I hope you were able to get on with your xmas cards
      the other evening. I have three of the TG's best cards for
      you: two of Tissot and one of Stubbs. These seemed to
      me the most suitable and they are the most expensive.

      I am most interested to hear that you have another
      still life in mind. I like the sound of The Dressing Table
      immensely. Let me know your new project when it is
      sufficiently clear in your own mind.  I will make
      notes of your catalogue before you come. I want
      it to be evocative as well as descriptive: I must
      not imprison you in one critic's view of you, so I
      must be allusive as well as introductory, yet
      without loss of clarity. That, as I see it, is what is
      required of me.

      You are right that this is the weather for still life -
      not landscape. There has been a bad fog in London
      since Thursday night. Today it has been practically
      impenetrable (to sight, I mean). Thick, dirty, greacy,
      sour, in texture - but pictorially fascinating in its
