      4th May

      Dearest, my dearest Sylvia,

      I hope your journey was an easy one, and that you slept well. Today I have not quite got used to the idea of not phoning you. As it is nearly 10 o'clock i feel I ought to be about to speak to you, to hear your voice. I would like to write and write but today I am terribly rushed, Hutchinson House to finish, di Chirico's lecture and his pictures, (and a haircut) so I must catch a train to town soon. Soon Dandylion will be flying about urgently with his briefcase, probably bumping into Yowalla. Or, perhaps Yowalla will go and sit on the top of the phone box at the head of the paragon and wait for me as he did on Sunday...

      I think of your beauty continually and long for the opportunity to spoil you, love you, and, even, perhaps, dress you up; I long in short for the time when you will be with
