      I have been wearing gloves so
      my hands aren't too bad.  I
      have put in a double row of
      peas; and some flower seeds in the
      seed bed near the house.  I
      shall manure the vegetable seed
      bed now but not put anything
      in it yet as the chickens keep
      getting out and trampling over everything.
      That's all my news, but I do love
      you, and miss you, and long to
      be with you.  I feel rather depressed,
      it is the date!
      i love you
      Sylvia
