      I had a good night. I only hope that
      you did too. It is eight o'clock in the
      morning. Soon I must have breakfast.
      Weren't we outrageous about the times
      we had our meals? Yesterday evening,
      after your train had gone - I'm so glad
      I came to East Croyden - I could not get
      adjusted to the time. By being together
      as we were and living only for [unclear]that[/unclear], the
      progress of hours and so is quite
      dislocated. The power of love is im-
      mense.

      Here it is not a bright day but I hope
      the light is good enough at [unclear]Pett[/unclear] for
      you to do your painting comfort-
      ably.

      Between my heart and my tummy I
      feel a strong fluttery feeling when
      I think of you. It is there now. Some
      times I tremble horribly. These physical
      symptoms of love will grow less fre-
      quest as I get into my work but you
      know my love is [unclear]fixed[/unclear] and cannot
      lessen.

      Last night I [unclear]narg[/unclear] Jonson and he
      was a bit cool. I apologized and we
      are having lunch together. The Soane
      museum in the afternoon, then, for me.
      But your heart will be there your
      presence. your wit and your apprec-
      nation of the house and pictures live in
      me.

      Wimbledon 1967

      I had a good night. I only hope that you did too. It is eight o'clock in the morning. Soon I must have breakfast. Aren't we outrageous about the times we had our meals? Yesterday evening, after your train had gone - I'm so glad I came to East Croyden - I could not get adjusted to the time. By being together as we were and living only for that, the progress of hours and so on is quite dislocated. The power of love is immense.

      [unclear]see[/unclear] it is not a bright day but I hope the light is good enough at Pett for you to do your painting comfortably.

      Between my heart and my tummy I feel a strange fluttery feeling when I think of you. It is there now. Sometimes, I tremble briefly. These physical symptoms of love will grow less frequent as I get into my work but you know my love is fixed and cannot lessen.

      Last night I rang [unclear]Johnson[/unclear] and he was a bit cool. I apologized and we are having lunch together. The Soane Museum in the afternoon, then, for me. But your heart will be there and your presence, your wit and your appreciation of the house and pictures live in me.
