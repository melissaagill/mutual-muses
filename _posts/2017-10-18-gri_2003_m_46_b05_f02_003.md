      A     Since I was a boy the [unclear]time[/unclear] site of Troy seemed to call me.
      [unclear]I[/unclear]   You're lucky no [unclear]Pria[/unclear] to rock on your back.

      A     Want to see the moon with heavy eyebrows
              of palm tree [unclear]leaves[/unclear] across that shining face.

      [unclear]g[/unclear]     I dont want to drink from baroque fountains
           Or get lost in a cell on a mountain.

      A     I wanted to go [unclear]once[/unclear] [unclear]I were[/unclear]-- the [unclear]enemy[/unclear]
      [unclear]g[/unclear]          You [unclear]round[/unclear] [unclear]like[/unclear] Daisy Miller which is [unclear]silly[/unclear].

      Then the sirens return :)
             [unclear]Rowa[/unclear] Japan Spain & [unclear]Brasil[/unclear]
           That sigh is the Caribbean
           [unclear]sounding[/unclear] in the shell of a girl.
           The seasons of the swing door
           is the [unclear]soft[/unclear] [unclear]lost[/unclear] you hope for.
           The hands [unclear]on[/unclear] the clock are a girl's
           They smooth & do not [unclear]line[/unclear] your skin.
           [unclear]Brazil[/unclear] [unclear]Rowa[/unclear] Spain & Japan.

      I wonder if you are in bed now (12.00): I soon shall be. I love
      you.   Good night, darling enchantress.  I love you
