      of your absence. I long for Easter to be
      over and to be with you again.
      My cousin Rosemary is odd: sometimes
      hopelessly silly but also claims Orphee as the
      best film she has seen & Yves Tanguy's
      Satin Pillow as one of her favourite paintings.
      On the other hand she is brainlessly intent on
      boys and hair cuts. She is pretty: otherwise
      I suppose her [unclear]chaos[/unclear] would be more repellent.
      Marion, 15, looks rather like me, they say:
      she & I keep surprising one another in side-
      long appraisals...Linda, 12ish, is a bril-
      liant clown & a mimic but about as
      ingratiating as Peter Simmons who, in
      benzedrine energy she resembles. She's
      fat - the other 2 are very slim. There:
      Dandy's relatives. Lucky there are not
      more.
      It is 6.00, time the N.G. closes, so I must
      stop. (I have been using CJ's office.)
      I love you, my life,
      I love you
