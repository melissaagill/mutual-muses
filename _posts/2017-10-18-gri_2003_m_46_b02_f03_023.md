      a tractor chugged petulantly and a small angular train - exuding virgin white smoke - ran along the valley, soundlessly, and disappeared beyond the mound of the barrow. Then I climbed up on the barrow and saw, in an adjoining field, a derelict tractor. I sat in the seat of it for some time and enjoyed the view and the warmth. I thought very poignantly of our country walks together.
      Now, as I say, I am sitting in the dazzling sun to write to you. Sylvia, I love you.

      I saw my parents yesterday and they are well. They gave me lots of food. Molly came to tea: She and Eric have got a new flat with a vast studio. Pablo is looking outrageously well - I fear he has caught less than his share of birds and mice to judge from his generous waist-line.

      a tractor chugged petulantly and a small [unclear]argular[/unclear]train - exuding virgin white smoke - ran along the valley, soundlessly, and disappeared beyond the round of the havant. Then I climbed upon the barrow and saw, in an adjoining field, a derelict tractor. I sat in teh seat of it for some time and enjoyed the view and the warmth. I though very poignantly of our country walks together.
      Now, as I say, I am sitting in the dazzling sun to write to you. Sylvia I love you.
      Good heavens, yes, cold cream is what I should have got! Well, vanishing creamlives up to its name so I shall soon have to get some cold cream.
      I saw my parents yesterday and they are well. They gave me lots of food. Molly came to tea: she and Eric have got a new flat with a vast studio. Pablo is looking outrageously well - I fear he has caught less than his share of birds and mice to judge from his generous waist-line. 'Nonsense' he said 'Its only my Winter Coat', and smoothed his hips indignantly with his paws. [Drawing should be here!]
