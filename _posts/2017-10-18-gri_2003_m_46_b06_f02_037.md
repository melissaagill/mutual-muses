      QUATRAIN
      A pearl would have to be, that I gave you,
      the color of the sky, not any air,
      but like this silver bruise of 6 o'clock:
      who gave you that gave something.

      TONIGHT AND NEXT
      The night means one things in the tune --
      the recumbent music, one thing
      in the ear, one things to a child
      locked in an unlearned room,
      and something again to me.

      On the level the night is wild,
      the night is wild, on the level
      of calm tests it is patient:
      it is soft, papery, hungry.
      Dark membrande.  Crude sack.

      The night means one thing in the tune
      and something again to me:
      The roaming effigy of sleep,
      wide waken by a music,
      feels for comfort in my head.

      (and here is a fragment I like from the Elegy:

      Ghost stories leave and do not make me cold.
      The haunted rooms are heads, not property,
      Suites of the past, windows they cannot rate.)

      Years ago I wrote a series of quatrains.  I feel
      rather like doing another set:  they can be done
      on trains, in drains, and between lectures, and I
      am quite pleased with the tone and image of the
      one above.

      QUATRAIN

      A pearl would have to be, that I gave you,
      the color of the sky, not any air,
      but like this silver bruise of 6 o'clock:
      who gave you that gave something.

      TONIGHT AND NEXT

      The night means one thing in the tune -
      the recumbent music, one thing
      in the ear, one thing to a child
      locked in an unlearned room,
      and something again to me.

      On the level the night is wild.
      the night is wild, on the level
      of calm tests it is patient:
      it is soft, papery, hungry.
      Dark membrane. Crude sack.

      The night means one thing in the tune
      and something again to me:
      The roaming effigy of sleep,
      wide waken by a music,
      feels for comfort in my head.

      (and here is a fragment I like from the Elegy:
