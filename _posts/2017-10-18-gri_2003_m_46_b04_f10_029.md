      I'll tell you a story
      If it wasn't true it is now
      Was a fox had two beards
      Chickens loved the red one
      And there that didn't like it blade
      They al, all the chicken
      Got eaten for under both beards
      The teeth stayed but the same

      Freedom is more than a ward
      It is a bed to fall form
      Any side you loose onto the floor
      By Brittania's foe...

      [Here the poem, found in a
      settle fleeting near the
      strange, broke off...
      presumably from exhaustion--

      Who will you elect today
      (many-headed islander)
      Who did solicit you
      until you caved in and rated?
      Candidates my be quoted
      Free-doom well reward who
      (many-handled islander)
      Trusts in either mono-play?
      I'll tell you a story
      If it wasn't true it is now
      Was a fox had two beards
      chickens loved all red one
      And there that didn't liked it blade
      They all, all the chickens
      That eaten for under both beards
      The teeth stayed but the same
      Freedoom is more than a word
      It is a bed to fall from
      Any side you choose onto one floor
      By Brittania's [unclear]poe[/unclear]...
      [Here the poem, found in a [unclear]settle [/unclear] fleeting near the strange, smoke off...measurably from exhaustion - all other words being commandeered & active politicians.]
