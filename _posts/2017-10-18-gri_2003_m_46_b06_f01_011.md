      Sunday
      Dearest Sylvia
      I hope you had a comfortable journey
      on Friday and that it wasn't too cold
      at the Rectory, without any fires. I hope, too,
      now that you are away from me again
      you will remember - not Tuesday & Wed-
      nesday, but - Thursday & Friday of your
      visit. Your anxiety & distress on the 1st
      2 days exaggerated the negative state of
      tings. I know I love you. I hope that
      you felt this on thursday & friday when
      we got on well again. Let me know how
      you are. It is natural for you to be tense
      now that you are leaving Pett for town &
      finally divorcing Michael. But don't
      torture yourself too badly. I know I helped
      bring on your attack of depression & I am
      sorry for it.

    annotation_text: '[24-1-54] Sunday Dearest Sylvia I hope you had a comfortable
      journey on Friday and that it wasn''t too cold at the Rectory,  without any
      fires. I hope, too, now that you are away from me again you will remember -
      not Tuesday & Wednesday, but - Thursday & Friday of your visit. Your anxiety
      & distress on the 1st 2 days exaggerated the negative state of things. I know
      I love you. I hope that you felt this on thursday & friday when we got on well
      again. Let me know how you are. It is natural for you to be tense now that you
      are leaving Pett for town & finally divorcing Michael. But don''t torture yourself
      too badly. I know I helped bring on your attack of depression & I am sorry for
      it.'
