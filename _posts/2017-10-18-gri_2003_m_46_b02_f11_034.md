      Blakcheath 21 xii 1949

      Dearest, my very dearest, Sylvia,

       I hope that your journey back is comfortable
      and that you enjoy seeing the Woods again (as I'm
      sure you will) as much as they will enjoy you, my
      darling, my beauty. How fortunate they are this
      Christmas to have your beauty to delight and charm
      them, your wit to stimulate and please them, and
      your intelligence to inform and, occasionally I am
      sure, agreeably disconcert them. I shall think
      of you in such terms all Christmas, my rose, add-
      ing all the associations and lyricism which it is
      the essential fortune of a lover above everybody
      else to know about his beloved.

      Forgive me for not phoning this morning for -
      despite my inclination - I felt it was necessary
      to get on with a Hogarth chapter. I believe that
      you will forgive me when I tell you that I have
      today (it is now 3.15 in the afternoon) written no
      less than half a chapter, a feat which surprises me
      a little. As I did no work yesterday and spent it
      happily with you this labour was essential. In the
      next two days I can finish this chapter and, all be-
      ing well, and I intend that all shall be well in this
      matter, start another. It is something of a plea-
      sure to be working again after a break.

      The sun has been bright today as I worked and it
      made me think of you and of the poem your lovely im-
      age suggested. Soon, soon I shall write it: your
      coloured fruit are about me on the walls of our room.
      Do not, my love, feel sad about the situation with
      Michael, at least, more sad than close association
