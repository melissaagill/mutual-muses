      I love your cloud poem, it is delicious. I adore the imagery. I am not really reading anything! Only journals-thank you for some small Giorgione details. Would you like me to send you the next Proust? By the way if you should have time do put our hyacinth in a pot of earth                                   and water. Put in window not quite covered (pen drawing-bulb with earth). I love you my darling, my beautiful lion, my elegant one-how I long to see you  how you stimulate and [unclear][/unclear]me.
