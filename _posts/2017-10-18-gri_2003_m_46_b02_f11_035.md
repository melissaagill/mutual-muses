      I received a charming letter from Clifford this morning in which I shall certainly save for you to read as it will amuse you very much.

      Did you go by Poynings on your way to Pett. I suppose not but I was wondering if you had seen Yawolla as I have not yet heard from him. I hope this is the turn on the tide in Y's fortunes.

      I love you so much, my beautiful, ravishing Minerva (how you have inspired my critic's pen today) and feel you with me which makes me happy. The variety and high quality of your pictures inspires me as well as giving me a great pleasure in themselves: I have just noticed a felicitious passage in the Pett Level oil which I had not seen before. and this morning, when I woke, admiring beams of sunlight opened a slit in the curtains and illuminated Venus so that I was literally dazzled by her as I so often am dazzled by you. I love you
