      2.

      ill effects. I advise you to have at least 2 with you - 1 for each half of the journey - when you come then you will avoid any germs that there may be, which are far more potent in that atmosphere. I managed my luggage very comfortably until I tried to round the corner by Woolworths which was very difficult as the wind was very strong and my paintings acted as a sail. I was however very glad of the good fresh air in my lungs. Tiny had a lovely meal ready when I got in, and I'm glad to say everyone was very cheerful.

      Tiny and Clifford are very much looking forward to seeing you, and to your lecture. Tiny said come before Thursday if you can - but I said you have Banstead on Wednesday.

      Your Tate interview draws on - I do wish you luck and I hope Tuesday's lecture goes well. Don't forget the 3rd testament
