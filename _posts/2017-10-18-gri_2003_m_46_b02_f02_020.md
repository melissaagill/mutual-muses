      7- ii-1949

      Dearest Sylvia-

      I love you - a belle, oh Minerva. You are never out of my thoughts! I long to see you-I [unclear][/unclear] remind myself that[unclear][/unclear] all the beauties and delicacies I attribute to you in absence are not my imaginings - but exist in fact. You are a marvelous creature- and I treasure and love you.

      Yesterday I wrote half a chapter about Hogarth. I am longing to read your Venetian article - I will try and celebrate it with a poem. Your carsone[unclear][/unclear] image has taken part in our long poem now.

      Your owls seem to like Beachheats[unclear][/unclear]. They too are working out a color scheme.
