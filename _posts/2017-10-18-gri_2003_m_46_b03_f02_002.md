      Blackheath
      Wednesday
      Dearest Sylvia,
      THank you for your two letters. Alas I am not able today to reply as fully as I should like to as I have two lectures and must leave home soon. Also I want to revise the Approach to Art one a little as I had a letter this morning saying Anthony Hinton, assistant regional director of the London Arts Council would be coming to the Woman's Institute. I don't know if this is a routine matter or if they are wondering if, now John is going, I am suitable for the Arts Council. We'll see.

      Yesterday I managed to get to the Redfern Gallery and see a new painter, Swiss, whom I met there, called Rolf Durig. He is quite good. I have sent off, terribly rushed, a review to Gainsborough this morning.

      I met Roland - of R, Browse, and Delbanco, yesterday - and he said he hoped to come along to the discussion about landscape, French or English, at the AI.A. He introduced the subject I was pleased to note.

      No slides as yet from the V and A for tonight. I may have to use books which is a wretched nuisance, as I shall have to carry them about, but all day!

      I shall write a longer letter tomorrow, my dearest one, and, for now, I can only say I adore you, long for Monday, and think of you continually,
      I love you, Lawrence
      There is a drawing at the bottom of the page and this PS is written in the margins: I had dinner with Charles J. last night (and Eve) and, remembering your advice, criticized the new drawings politely - with great effect - I think. xxxxL.

      you for your two letters.  Alas I am not able to-\nday to reply as fully as
      I should like to as I have two \nlectures and must leave home soon.  Also I
      want to revise \nthe Approach to Art one a little as I had a letter this \nmorning
      saying Anthony Hinton, assistant regional director \nof the London Arts Council
      would be coming to the Woman's \nInstitute.  I don't know if this is a routine
      matter or\nif they are wondering if, now John is going, I am suitable \nfor
      the Arts Council.  We'll see.\n\n   Yesterday I managed to get to the Redfern
      Gallery and \nsee a new painter, Swiss, whom I met there, called Rolf \nDurig.
      \ He is quite good.  I have sent off, terribly \nrushed, a review to Gainsborough
      this morning.\n\n   I met Roland - of R. Browse, and Delbanco, yesterday - \nand
      he said he loped to come along to the discussion about \nlandscape, French or
      English, at the AI.A.  He introduced \nthe subject I was pleased to note.\n\n
      \  No slides as yet from the V and A for tonight.  I  may \nhave to use books
      which is a wretched nuisance, as I shall \nhave to carry them about, but all
      day!\n\n   I shall write a longer letter tomorrow, my dearest one, \nand, for
      now, I can only say I adore you, long for Monday,\n and think of you continually.\n
