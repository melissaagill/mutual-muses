      6.XII.1948 11 Mansel Road
      Wimbeldon
      Dearest Sylvia;
      Thank you very much for your letter.
      My love, I know you re in a terribly
      difficult position, but you must be
      prepared to act out of loving me when
      Michael is nice as well as when he is
      not.  Do not think I do not feel
      your dilemma.  You seem to think I
      do not appreciate your conflict.  This
      is not so -- and if my letters have
      seemed over-confident it is only be-
      cause I wanted to spare you emotion-
      al pains.  I know the terrible conflict
      and suffer acutely with you as the
      days & nights edge slowly by.  I know
      the persuasive weight of the past, the
      reality of M. when we are apart.
      Do not, I implore you, allow our love
      to be battered any longer by separa-
      tion, divided allegiance.  Your
      pain in the letter makes me so unhappy.
