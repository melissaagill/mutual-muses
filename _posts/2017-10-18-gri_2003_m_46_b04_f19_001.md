      Dearest Lawrence,
      I love you so much, and
      so much enjoyed your stay.
      I look forward to your return
      with great eagerness. I hope
      you had a comfortable journey and
      arrived home to find all well
      and not too dusty. I hope
      all your letters were pleasant
      and you could have a deep [unclear]batt[/unclear]!
      I write this from my bed. I
      have pottered about as usual so
      I expect that you are in bed too!
      I was glad to observe that
      you were able to buy some bread.
      You had just disappeared when
      I remembered that I had not
      posted [unclear]Lucy's[/unclear] letters. So I pelted
      across the road and back just
      before the bus went.
      [unclear]Lucy[/unclear] and Clifford had not
      had tea when I got back.
