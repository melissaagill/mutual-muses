      PAINTING OUT OF DOORS IV
      I have heard of but one painting which was unanimously acclaimed at the time of its completion. That is Duccio's Ruccellai Madonna which was said to have been carried through the streets in triumph by the jubilant citizens of Florence in 1285, because for the first time a picture of the Madonna had been painted in a relatively naturalistic manner and representing a gracious and tender woman instead of the awe-inspiring and remote Queen of Heaven. This achievement seems to have coincided with a deep emotional need which, when it was unexpectedly gratified, produced an overwhelming demonstration of joy and enthusiasm.
      Such displays seem to us, today, to have an endearing naivete, the spontaneous vivacity of a Golden Age. So that when people look over our shoulder, peering closely at our work, questioning us on our views of art, we should perhaps be patient and pleased at their interest, thinking that there may yet be another happy period when original works of art will arouse universal interest with which prices and wages are discussed today. Taste and reason may again combine to bring about a second Renaissance, when art shall be as necessary as bread and butter to our well-being.
      Alas, such illusions are quickly dispelled, for passing a corner of Parliament Square in a 'bus one afternoon, I saw a number of people standing behind a low barricade, gazing in front of them with rapt attention, while busy crowds passed near them: they were watching labourers making a hole in the road.

    annotation_text: "PAINTING OUT OF DOORS IV\nI have heard of but one painting which
      was unanimously acclaimed at the time of its completion. That is Duccio's Ruccellai
      Madonna which was said to have been carried through the streets in triumph by
      the jubilant citizens of Florence in 1285, because for the first time a picture
      of the Madonna had been painted in a relatively naturalistic manner and representing
      a gracious and tender woman instead of the awe-inspiring and remote Queen of
      Heaven. This achievement seems to have coincided with a deep emotional need
      which, when it was unexpectedly gratified, produced an overwhelming demonstration
      of joy and enthusiasm. \nSuch displays seem to us, today, to have an endearing
      naivete,\nthe spontaneous vivacity of a Golden Age. So that when people\nlook
      over our shoulder, peering closely at our work, questioning us on our views
      of art, we should perhaps be patient and pleased\nat their interest, thinking
      that there may yet be another happy period when original works of art will arouse
      \nthe universal interest with which prices and wages are discussed today. Taste
      and reason may again combine to bring about a second Renissance, when art shall
