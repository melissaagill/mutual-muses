      I arrived here in good time and rang up to find all in and welcoming. I felt rather rotten yesterday, aching and shivering - but was spoiled yesterday with excellent omlette suppor - whiskey and hot bath - I had breakfast in bed and stayed there until 12 noon! I feel much better today - still a little tired - and a bit sniffy but much improved.
      It was so good to see you even for so short a time; and I look forward with impatience to the 23rd - though I hope as much as I have so much to do the time will pass very quickly. I am staying on to-night - Georgie seems to want me to, & I am glad to it is restful and they are very kind. Though I am looking forward to getting back to my large still-life - I shall work in the garden and paint, but try to "take things easy" as I still feel so very tired.
      I have no news of course! I will write and tell you any when I get back. I think I am going to a local dramatic production
