      A rebus, secrets Sylvia
      In the colour's perfect islands:
      Sylvia's birth from the sea of April.

         Have a pleasant Sunday with Mrs. Taft.   For myself I am taking Olidre to The Browinng Version this evening & tomorrow she is taking me to the horse-show where I believe am to be exhibited to selected school friends.
         (I have the Arthurian legend book here.)
         I love you, dearest beauty.  I adore you
                  Lawrence
