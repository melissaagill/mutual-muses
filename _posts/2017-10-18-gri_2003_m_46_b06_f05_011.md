      10 v 1953 Blackheath My dearest Sylvia:

      I am back home from Bath, recalled rather suddenly by a cable
      from America. You may remember that I mentioned my synopsis
      had been sent to Art News. The editor cabelled me that he
      wants my article immediately with photographs. So I rushed
      back from Bath at once and with one hand I am collecting the
      photographs and with the other writing the article (3,000 words).
      Although I had collected some material there is still an awful lot
      to do, as you will appreciate.

      Today, Sunday (I got back yesterday), I have been writing and
      revising my article since 10:00 in the morning. It is now
      10:00 at night (almost as late as I dare type because of Mrs
      Harrison below). I have stopped the post office redirecting
      my mail (I think) and Connie will forward to me any letters
      of yours that go to Bath.

      I was fascinated by the article on Menotti. How does The
      Consul fit in to the pattern, I wonder? I suppose that the
      frustrating male opponent appears directly in it; or does
      he? Anyway it was exactly what I needed for my bit about
      isolated characters in 20c. milieu.

      I have worked with the window open at the bottom all day.
      Now there are only the sparkling lights of, let's face it,
      Lee and Eltham. They are beautiful at night. One no longer
      hears the moan of trams that we used to hear when we dined
      by the open window: remember? Soon we shall dine by the
      open window as we did before, provided only that the summer
      weather keeps as fine as this.

      Wash and bed for a lion, now. Goodnight, my love, my dear.
      11 v
      Thank you so much for letter which as just come via Bath.
      Delighted that you are so social and that you are painting
      so well. I cannot really write more at the moment
      as I have to get to the post office and get off photographs
      to Art News, and I shall post this at the same time.
      I'll write again directly at more lengths.
      I love you

      Now there are only the sparkling lights of, let's face it,
      Lee and Eltham.  They are beautiful at night.  One no longer
      hears the moan of trams that we used to hear when we dined
      by the open window:  remember?  Soon we shall dine by the
      open window as we did before, provided only that the summer
      weather keeps as fine as this.
      Wash and bed for a ion, now.  Goodnight, my love, my dear.
      Thank you so much for letters which has just come via Bath.
      Delighted that you are so social and that you are painting
      so well.  I cannot really write more at the moment
      as I have to get to the post office and get off photographs
      of Art News, and I shall post this at the same time.
      I'll wire again directly at more length.
      I love you
      Lawrence

      back home from Bath, recalled rather suddenly by a cable<br/>from America.  You
      may remember that I mentioned my synopsis<br/>had been sent to Art News.  The
      editor cabelled me that he<br/>wants my article immediately with photographs.  So
      I rushed<br/>back from Bath at once and with one hand I am collecting the<br/>photographs
      and with the other writing the article (3,000 words).<br/>Although I had collected
      some material there is still an awful lot<br/>to do, as you will appreciate.<br/>Today,
      Sunday (I go back yesterday), I have been writing and<br/>revising my article
      since 10.00 in the morning.  It is now<br/>10.00 at nigh (almost as late as
      I dare type because of Mrs<br/>Harrison below).  I have stopped the post office
      redirecting<br/>my mail (I think) and Connie will forward to me any letters<br/>of
      yours that go to Bath.<br/>I was fascinated by the article on Menotti.  How
      does The<br/>Consul fit in to the pattern, I wonder?  I suppose that the<br/>frustrating
      male opponent appears directly in it; or does<br/>he?   Anyway it was exactly
      what I needed for m bit about<br/>isolated characters in 20c. milieu.<br/>I
      have worked with the window open at the bottom all day.<br/>Now there are only
      the sparkling lights of, let''s face it,<br/>Lee and Eltham.  They are beautiful
