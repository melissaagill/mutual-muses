      18th March 1949
      Dearest Sylvia
      I am not in the least enjoying writing
      to you after a month in which it was not
      necessary to do so! On the other hand
      love impels me to write as often as I can.
      Mainly I want to say 'I love you'.

      Immediately after your departure I re-
      alised that I had not got our locket with
      me. It must be packed with my velvet
      jacket. I am so sad to be without it.
      When you were here in person, as it were,
      I neglected the locket, alas, and now must
      be without it until April.

      Yesterday I wrote ten duty letters, Mrs
      Gardiner, Mrs Poole, lines, etc., so I hope
      to hear soon exactly when the flat will
      be vacant.

      '' The Aubreys'' County Guest House
      Hemel Hempstead Road
      Redbourne, Herts.

      18th March 1949

      Dearest Sylvia.
      I am not in the least enjoying writing to you after a month in which it was not necessary to do so! On the other hand lone impels me to write as often as I can, mainly I want to say 'I love you'.

      Immediately after your departure I realised that I had not got our locket with me. It must be [unclear]pocked[/unclear] with my velvet jacket. I am so sad to be without it. when you were here in person, asit were, I neglected the locket, alas, and now must be without it until April.
      Yesterday I wrote ten duty letters, mrs gardiner, mrs Poole, Lines, &c., so I hope to hear soon exactly when the flat will be vacant.
