      Wimbledon
      27 December 1953
      Dearest Sylvia
      How did your Xmas go? I hope it went well - with pleasant conversations and good food and drink. Tell me all your news and I'll tell you mine. 1st, Yawalla sends his thanks for a Christmas card of his own!
      This Xmas has been less successful than those with the Bath people, I'm afraid. We had trouble entertaining ourselves - having to cast about desperately for things to do. Still, tho' the social part was dull the food was great & the drinks plentiful. Mandy is terribly remote & distant but we did what we could for her - I fixed games so she won, and so on.
      Eric & Molly were here - he is recovering, now, from his operation and is really almost well again.
      I have not had a chance to read, unfortunately, so Chandler still tempts me. Tomorrow when I'm home I shall read it. I can't wait much longer. Hugh & Robin gave me The Sculptures of Picasso, a very nice book indeed.
      Magda's Xmas Eve party was a great success. Hugh brought his parents and brother and sister-in-law. They were charming people, different kinds of Americans: Hugh & Robin very civilised, his elder brother & his wife agreeable but stupid comparatively - harder (they live in Chicago), Mr J. senior a rich busy man who wasn't in a hurry that night, & Mrs J. senior the one who has least covered a humble start.

      27 December 1953
      Dearest Sylvia
      How did your xmas go? I hope it went well - with pleasant conversations and good food and drink. Tell me all your news and I'll tell you mine. 1st Yawalla sends his thanks foe a Christmas card of his own!

      This xmas has been less successful than those with the Bath people, I'm afraid. We had trouble entertaining ourselves - having to cast about desperately for things to do. Still, tho' the social part was dull the food was great & the drink plenti-ful. Mandy is terribly remote & distant but we did what we could for her: I fixed games so she won, and so on. Eric & Nelly were here - he is recovering, now, from his op-eration and is really almost well again.

      I have not had a chance to read, unfortunately, so Chandler still tempts me. Tomorrow when I'm home I shall read it. I can't wait much longer. Hugh & Robin gave me The Sculptures of Picasso, a very nice book indeed.

       Magda's xmas eve party was a great success. Hugh bought his parents and brother and sister-in-law. They were charming people, different kinds of America: Hugh & Robin very civilised, his elder brother & his wife agreeable but stupid corporatively - harder (they live in Chicago), Mr J senior a rich busy man who wasn't in a hurry that night, & Mrs J senior the one who has least covered a humble start.
