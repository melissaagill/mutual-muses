      Friday

      11 Mansel Road

      [10-7-48]

      My dearest Sylvia

      In my last letter there was not room for everything & one thing [unclear]I had not yet[/unclear] squeezed out was news of Holly. She is recovering - but too slowly. Ricky has behaved with rare stupidity and there have been rows that are now over and have made him see how serious a state she is in. So perhaps it will, temporarily of course, be easier for her. Her holiday starts next week. [unclear]This shall[/unclear] be there part of the time, but I shan't be there as Ricky won't have me.

      Swift wrote in a birthday poem to Stella 'You every year (my) debt enlarge.' This applies, if you replace years by smaller units of time, to my debt to you very exactly. As my knowledge and 'sense' of you increases, I esteem and love you more and more. There was so much I did not know when I first said I loved you. And yet, incomplete as my image of you was, how right it was, too. See the things that were undrawn

      my dearest Sylvia

      In my last letter there was not room for everything [unclear]in one thing that got[/unclear] squeesed out was news of [unclear]Wally[/unclear]. She is recovering - but too slowly. Ricky has behaved with rare stupidity and there have been rows that are now over and have made him see how serious a state she is in. So perhaps it will, temporarily of course, be easier for her. Her holiday starts next week **** will be there part of the time, but I won't be there as Ricky won't have me.

      Swift wrote in a birthday poem to Stella 'You every year (my) debt enlarge'. This applies, if you replace years by smaller units of time, to my debt to you very exactly. As my knowledge and 'sense' of you increases, I esteem and love you more and more. There was so much I did not know when I first said I loved you. And yet, incomplete as my image of you was how right it was too. All the things that were unknown
