      Dearest Lawrence
                I wonder if you went to Brighton --
      The weather is fairly nice here, but
      terribly changeable.  I went to church
      this morning with Tiny and her niece.
      Clifford preached well as usual.
           I hope to work again on the landscape
      on Monday morning -- in the afternoon
      I am going to work on the Savage
      child again.  We had an agreeable evening
      with them yesterday -- I spent most of it
      with Mrs. Savage who I like very much,
      and who is very interested in my work.
           I shall be very interested to hear about
      the Children's art exhibition and your
      [unclear]Veronese[/unclear] lecture -- I hope the other exhib-
      ition is nearing completion.
           I am interested to hear of a possible
      magazine -- how exciting --
           According to your illustration perhaps
      you water the plants too strongly!
           Now let me be sure -- your birthday

      Pett 10.9.50
      Dearest Lawrence,
      I wonder if you went to Brighton.
      The weather is fairly nice here, but
      terribly changeable. I went to church
      this morning with Tiny and her niece -
      Clifford preached well as usual.
      I hope to work on again on the landscape
      on Monday morning - in the afternoon
      I am going to work on the Savage
      child again. We had an agreeable evening
      with them yesterday. I spent most of it
      with Miss Savage who I like very much
      and who is very interested in my work.
      I shall be very interested to hear about
      the Children's art exhibition and your
      Veronese lecture - I hope the other exhib-
      ition is nearing completion.
      I am interested to hear of a possible
      magazine - how exciting.
      According to your illustration perhaps
      you water the plants too strongly!
      Now let me be sure - your birthday
      is on the 14th is it not?
