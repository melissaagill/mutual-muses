      The tax-man is empowered
      To assess each book of hours.
      On every heraldic device
      You must pay at least twice.
      The entertainment duty's
      Brought the tourney to it's knees.

      MAN IN THE CROWD: There are no minstrels in the gallery.

      SPIV: I'ma gonna spell my woman, sell her to the squire,
      I'ma gonna spell my woman, sell her to the squire.
      The I'll square my taxes, and relax, relax, yeah.

      STALL*KEEPER: How can I pay the taxes on my house and land?
      How can I pay the taxes on my house and land?
      If I pay all my taxes I shall have to stand.

      TRAVEL AGENT: When summer came round, people used to get movin.
      When summer came round, people used to get movin.
      But now who can afford to go see their brothers?

      A man (an Agitator) from the crowd singles himself out by a vigorous mime: empty pockets, holes in his hose & C.
      The people gather round him attentively. They come to a decision. The camera pans with the crowd to the Town Hall: a hand hangs a sign 'Mar de Mayor' on the door.
      Agitator bangs on the door and reluctantly the Mayor appears, putting his chain of office which gets tangled.

      CROWD: No one is buying my goods.
      The prices are too high.
      How can we go on like this.
      It's more than we can stand.
      What are you going to do.
      What are you going to do about it?

      MAYOR: What can I do?
      I am no better off than you.
      It isn't in my hands.
      It is a national not a local matter.

      CROWD: You'd better do somethings.
      It's more than we can stand.
      How can we go on like this?
      We elected you. Do something.

      MAYOR: You ought to see the Minister.

      The tax-man is empowered
      To assess each book of ours.
      On every heraldic device
      You must pay at least twice.
      The entertainment duty's
      Brought the tourney to it's knees.

      MAN IN THE CROWD:  There are no minstrels in the gallery.

      SPIV:  I'm gonna sell my woman, sell her to the squire.
      I'm gonna sell my woman, sell her to the squire.
      Then I'll square my taxes, and relax, relax, yeah.

      STALL*KEEPER:  How can I pay the taxes on my house and land?
      How can I pay the taxes on my house and land?
      If I pay all my taxes I shall have to stand.

      TRAVEL AGENT:  When summer came round, peple used to get moving.
      When summer came round, people used to get moving.
      But now who can afford to go see their brothers?

      A man (an Agitator) from the crowd singles himself out by
      a vigorous mime:  empty pockets, holes in his hope, do.
      The people gather round him attentively.  They come to a
      decision.   The camera pans with the crow to the Town
      Hall:  a hand hangs a sign 'Mal de Mayer' on the door.
      Agitator bangs on the door and reluctantly the Mayor ap-
      pears, putting on his chain of office which gets tangled.

      CROWD:  No one is buying my goods.
      The prices are too high.
      How can we go on like this.
      It's more than we can stand.
      What are you going to do.
      What are you going to do about it?

      MAYOR:  What can I do?
      I am no better off than you.
      It isn't in my hands.
      It is a national not a local matter.

      CROWD:  You'd better do something.
      It's more than we can stand.
      How can we go on like this?
      We elected you.  Do something.

      MAYOR:  You ought to see the Minister.
