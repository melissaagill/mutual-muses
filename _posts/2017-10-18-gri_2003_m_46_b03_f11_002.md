      Paddington I [unclear]XII[/unclear] 50

      Dearest Sylvia

      Thank you for your two letters which came this morning & cheered
      me immensely after a restless night from which I awoke with a
      headache. I will certainly go to the Kensington Gallery on
      Monday for your pictures. Alas I do not have, at the
      moment of writing, my Jare [unclear]a[/unclear] [unclear]Pett[/unclear] and in any case I have
      some lectures to prepare for next week. But I will be
      able to see you soon - very soon. I am desperate
      to see you again - [unclear]ah[/unclear] my dear, oh my dear.

      By the way I said in my letter to Gainsboro' that you
      had suggested [unclear]?[/unclear] Cuyp's Artist Sketching in a Landscape? (of
      which I have a reproduction) as the lejanne [unclear]photos[/unclear].

      Bellinis' [unclear]Circumsicion[/unclear] at the N. G. now cleaned is
      similar in some ways to our lovely Presentation at the
      Querini Stampalia. You will realise from my hand
      writing that the train has started for [unclear]B'ham[/unclear].
      I am seeing K. [unclear]Garlick[/unclear] this afternoon to borrow
      slides from the Barber. I am sure you are jealous!

      I do envy you Clifford's lecture & anticipate
      seeing your notes with pleasure.

      My new poems for you are still unfinished & I
      must do some more work on Lautrec so I must
      close. Oh Sylvia - I adore you.

      Think of your lion lovingly - as he does of you.

      I love you dearly
      Lawrence
