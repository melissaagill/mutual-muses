      the two sets of children).
      The anti-clericalism is accompanied, as often in French films,
      by peasants treated with a combination of naturalism and carica-
      ture: the feud of neighbours, for example, is caricatured, but
      brilliant acting invests the absurd figures with a sence of life -
      of flesh, bolld, and hair. Rene Clement's feeling for charact-
      er shades into delicate insight in his handling of the children.
      Paulette, unable to understand the death of her parents, mourns
      her dog: 'death' and prayer are words to her without the meaning & values
      experience attaches to them. Michel is more knowledgable but
      protects Paulette: he learns the game from her, without her be-
      lief in it, but with loving motives which gives his actions another
      kind of innocence. This relationship, which is the core of the
      file, is touching and perceptive: when their game touches real-
      ity (in the increasingly ambitious series of thefts to provide
      crosses for the animal's graves), reality is made absurd. By
      comparison with their lyrical phantasies reality is official,
      pompous, clumsy. Reality finally separates the children and a
      chilling experience of loss in communicated. Michel destroys
      the animal cemetry, partly in an effort to efface Paul-
      ette's memory: he places her braclet by the owl's nest, in re-
      turn for the dead mole which he took from the owl to keep Paul-
      ette's dog company. Michel, the peasant, is arranged and destruc-
      tive; Paulette, younger, more gentle and genteel, is stunned by

      by peasants treated with a combination of naturalism and carica-
