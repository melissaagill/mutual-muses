       You seem to be lucky at Pett for the weather here is poor. Indeed it tends to be foggy. Lucky Tiny and [unclear]Sll[/unclear], reclaiming paths from chaotic, indifferent Nature by the moronic farmers - a source of psychic satisfaction as well as pleasant exercise.
      Do come on Monday. We can dine on something more than luises for about a week. I long to see you again. If you come on the afternoon 'bus I cannot meet you , but I will leave a key on the ledge containing the meters above the front door. Let me know which bus you decide. I could meet a later one as my appointment is 3.30.
       I enclose the R. I. form for M. The other form I am keeping here as you would only have to bring it back. (No, I don't think it 'a good thing' that he should send something in. I think it 'no thing'.) Existentialist lion dramatizes the raid that is M. Who says nothing is not a thing?

      You seem to be lucky at Pett for the weather here is poor. Indeed it tends to be foggy. Lucky Tiny and See, reclaiming paths from chaotic, indifferent Nature & the moronic farmers - a source of psychic satisfaction as well as pleasant exercise.
      Do come on Monday. We can live on something more than kisses for about a week. I long to see you again. If you come on the afternoon 'bus I cannot meet you but I will leave a key on the ledge containing the metres above the front door. I could meet a later one as my appointment is 3.30.
      I enclose the R.I. fromfor M. The other form I am keeping here as you would only have to bring it back. (No, I don't think it 'a good thing' that he should send something in. I think it is 'no thing'.) Existentialist lion dramatises the void taht is M. who says nothing is not a thing.
