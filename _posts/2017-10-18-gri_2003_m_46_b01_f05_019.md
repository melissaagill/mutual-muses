      WIMbledon 1987 11 MANSEL ROAD, WIMBLEDON.

      Sunday

      My dearest Sylvia

      It is twenty minutes to eleven and
      I shall think about you well until 11
      and even, if Dandylion is very indul-
      gent and allows himself to succumb com-
      pletely to his delights, later than that.

      Did you go to to lady from Shanghii
      again I'm sure you did. I envy you for
      I want to see you again... I meant to
      write see it (the film) again but as you
      can see I made a symptomatic slip. The
      main obscurity in the narrative - that is,
      at what point was Rita Hayworth really
      attached to O'Hara and when did the plan to
      make him 'fall guy' really go into operation -
      was an amazing reference if you think a-
      bout it. Welles made the film im-
      mediately after his marriage to Hayworth
      and I am sure that he unconsciously and
      deliberately confused the actual outlines
      of her treachery, the treachery of the charac-
      her she played. The construction of the [unclear]very[/unclear]
      sequence was superb and, symbolism
      [unclear]here[/unclear], Welles goes down the steps into his
      cabin, then up again, and in the sequence
      near its close there are only close ups of
      himself and Hayworth.

      And oh the sound track. It is still
      in my ears, rich, [unclear]harsh[/unclear], complex.
