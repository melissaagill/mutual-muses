      3 Many things on the Sunday before -
      if we would be allowed to - then
      there would be no rush at all
      I should think - and we could
      have it just as we liked!
      I'm so glad you've had some time
      for writing at last. You seem to have
      done an enormous amount! The
      weather is absolutely vile - I
      must go and post this though.
      Tiny is really well to-day I'm
      glad to say.
      I'm longing for Saturday to
      see you - but I have such an awful lot to do before then.
      I love you
      Sylvia
