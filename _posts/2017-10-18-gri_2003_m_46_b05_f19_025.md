      Dearest Lawrence,
      How sweet of you to write so quickly.
      I had your letter this morning and am
      so glad and relieved that you are
      better. I do hope that you can rest
      today, for you had a pretty stre-
      uous day for one not well. How
      stoical of you to do your letures -
      and obviously so successfully -
      brave Lion.
      I feel happier to-day and slept
      well I am already looking forward
      to seeing you again - so I do
      not feel so sad.
      I put in some more winter vegetables
      this morning - the last lot; and tidied
      up a bit for Mrs Owens. I am
      going down to bathe I think
      though I'm not sure - the wind is
      very high.

      How sweet of you to write so quickly. I had your letter this morning and am so glad and relieved that you are better. I do hope that you can rest to-day, for you had a pretty strenuous day for one not well. How stoical of you to do your lectures - and obviously so successfully - brave Lion.
      I feel happier to-day and slept well I am already looking forward to seeing you again - so I do not feel so sad.
      I put in some more winter vegetables this morning - the last lot. and tidied up a bit for Mrs. Owens. I am going down to bathe I think though I'm not sure - the wind is very high.
