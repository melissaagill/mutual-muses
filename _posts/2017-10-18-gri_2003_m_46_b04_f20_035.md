      5  Submit the 1/2 to Hodders?  Have
      you heard any more of Hogarth?
      There is a nice catechiosm, answer
      you can now, there's a good Lion!
      Look after yourself my dearest poet,
      my Lion.  I hope to come to London
      about the 12th or 18th.  When Clifford
      and Marjorie come back from their
      holiday.  Then I shall want to see
      the exhibition on the South Bank
      again - the pleasure gardens and
      the exhibition at the Science Museum
      and if possible Lansbury Village!
      I hope you find this congenial!
      I very much look forward to it.
      I love you, I love you
