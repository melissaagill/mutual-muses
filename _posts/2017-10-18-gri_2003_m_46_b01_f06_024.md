      As if at Pett a nightingale
      Vanquishes the tender pigeons.
      Her pagan harmony
      Shames the soft sincere doves
      And the absent-minded sun.

      A bas-relief, a dance, a lyre:
      As plaster flakes the dancers go
      But an outline summons yet
      A classic connotation
      The public have not quite reduced.

      Roman emperors stare
      Tirelessly on battered walls,
      Cracked, discolored, worn,
      Beside the slim triumphal gate,
      Flattered pinkly by the sun.

      Sphinxes short on oracles line a path.
      Lions query the intruders
      With a stylised savagery.
      The sun rises in the river
      Almost to horizon-level.

      The lawn leans to the water.
      A swan edges there, whiter than
      The bridge:  Palladian,
      But stained and chipped as an old tooth.
      (An S of flowers holds in my mind.)

      Plump vases gleam against
      Holly-dark shadows in the groves.
      Here is a temple, elegant among
      Rife waterlilies and dark pines,
      Protected by an obelisk:

      As if at Pett a nightingale
      Vanquishes the tender pigeons.
      Her pagan harmony
      Shames the soft sincere doves
      And the absent-minded sun.

      A bas-relief, a dance, a lyre:
      As plaster flakes the dancers go
      But an outline summons yet
      A classic connotation
      The public have not quite reduced.

      Roman emperors stare
      Tirelessly on battered walls,
      Cracked, discolored, worn,
      Beside the slim triumphal gate,
      Flattered pinkly by the sun.

      Sphinxes short on oracles line a path.
      Lions query the intruders
      With a stylised savagery.
      The sun rises in the river
      Almost to horizon-level.

      The lawn leans to the water.
      A swan edges there, whither than
      The bridge: Palladian,
      But stained and chipped as an old tooth.
      (An S of flowers holds in my mind.)

      Plump vases gleam against
      Holly-dark shadows in the groves.
      Here is a temple, elegant among
      Rife waterlilies and dark pines,
      Protected by an obelisk:
