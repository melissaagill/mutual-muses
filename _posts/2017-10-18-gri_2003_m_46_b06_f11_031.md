      Dearest Sylvia
      I am sorry to hear you do not yet know what M is doing. Did
      South contact him?  What was the result?  On that, of course,
      depends where you should stay when you come for the 10th.  If
      there is a chance of M [unclear]behaving[/unclear] properly it would be wiser to
      go to [unclear]Dave's[/unclear], as you suggest.  I want to be with you very badly
      but if the house survey is positive we will be together very soon
      & it would be bad if a Queen's Procter did happen around.
      Still we can see.
      What you say about sending South the report is a good idea.
      I will make you a precis.  I was always commended at
      school for my precis work, I remember: one of the few things I
      could do in those inhibited days.  If you come up to check
      details in the house we must meet and if possible have the
      day together: but I may not be free all day, as you know.

      I will do as you say in your sweet letter and try to rest be-
      tween work.  I am busy - but between times I will relax.  (I have
      not been to the cinema for ages.)

      Good for you that you can make Diana paint - and paint
      large pictures, too.  What is the subject?  (I must write
      to her.)

      Finally got invited to Robert Melville's [unclear]feat[/unclear] for a drink.  It
      is in a [unclear]meus[/unclear] behind Bedford Square.  Too intricate & busy
      for me but with nice pictures (small) - Matta, Picasso, Ma-
      gritte, &c. (Too many up at once - I thought.)

      Ok drist: I must go to town.  C.O.I.D. this time.  (Yes, my
      Klee piece was for the ICA & for encounter.)

      I'll let you know as soon as I hear from [unclear]Danialt[/unclear]

      Love you
      Lawrence

      Dearest Slyvia
      I am sorry to hear you do not yet know what M is doing. Did South contact him? What was the result? On that, of course, depends where you should stay when you come for the 10th. If there is a chance of M behaving properly it would be wiser to go to Doe's, as you suggest. I want to be with you very badly but if the house survey is positive we will be together very soon & it would be bad if a Queen's Proctor did happen around. Still we can see.
      What you say about sending South the report is a good idea. I will make you a [unclear]preus[/unclear]. I was always commended at school for my [unclear]preus[/unclear] work, I remember: one of the few things I could do in those inhibited days. If you come up to check details in the house we must meet and if possible have the day together: but I may not be free all day, as you know.

      I will do as you say in your sweet letter and try to rest between work. I am busy - but between times I will relax. (I have not been to the cinema for ages.)
      Good for you that you can make Diana paint - and paint large pictures, too. What is the subject? (I must write to her.)
      Finally got invited to Robert Meville's flat for a drink. It is in a mews behind Bedford Square. Too intricate & busy for me but with nice pictures (small) - Matte, Picasso, Magritte, & c. (too many up at once - I thought.)
      Oh Christ: I must go to town. C.O.I.D. this time. (Yes, my Klee piece was for the ICA & for Encounter.) I'll let you know soon as I hear from Donialt. I love you Lawrence
