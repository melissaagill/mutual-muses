      Bath

      Dearest Lawrence,
      I hope your lecture was well attended
      yesterday and that you enjoyed. Here
      today it has been rather grey with
      sunny interludes, and now at about
      6.30 it has dissolved into a drizzle. Yesterday
      was nearly perfect and we sat out in
      the garden for tea and coffee after lunch.
      Aunt Margaret and I went shopping in the
      morning walking down to the town Aun
      Margaret pointing out the sights on the
      way. On passing a rather attractive
      little antique shop and always mindful
      of my Dandy I was attracted by
      a splendid Staffordshire lion. His price
      however was prohibitive but I bought 2
      little opaque glass toilet bottles and white
      with crudely painted moss roses - 4.
      I sent of the Bath [unclear]olives[/unclear] to Mrs
      Clark and have sent the features lists
      to her also.

      21-8-52 Hermitage Road Bath. Dearest Lawrence,
      I hope your lecture was well attended
      yesterday and that you enjoyed. Here
      to-day it has been rather grey with
      sunny interludes, and now at about
      6:30 it has desolved into a drizzle. Yesterday
      was nearly perfect and we sat out in
      the garden for tea and coffee after lunch.
      Aunt Margaret and I went shopping in the
      morning walking down to the town, Aunt
      Margaret pointing out the sights on the
      way. On passing a rather attractive
      little antique shop and always mindful
      of my Dandy, I was attracted by
      a splended Staffordshire lion - his price
      however was prohibitive but I bought 2
      little opaque glass toilet bottles in white
      with crudely painted moss roses - 2/
      I sent off the Bath [unclear][/unclear] to Mrs
      Clark and have sent the Lecture lists
      to her also.
