      Dearest Sylvia,
      Thank you so much for your letter this morning. I am most disturbed to hear that you are not well yet. I hope that you are managing to sleep fairly long hours. As you say, you will surely be well this month.
      The flat is rather bare at present as I have taken down most of your pictures: my parents are coming this evening, and Betty. I have emptied the cupboard in the kitchen and, nearer the time of their arrival, I shall put the large ones in there for the evening. They will be unharmed for there is plenty of room. I do like more than every your Ajax and the Poet, seeing it again after a weekend away from it.
      I have been working on tomorrow's lecture, using Antal, making a lot of notes which I shall type out after this. I begin to know a little about early Florentine art, supplementing what you have previously told me. I remember again, so vividly, Spinello Aretino's superb frescoes in S. Miniato. Do you remember? I got some photographs while you painted Florence.
      Over the weekend Betty and I painted the bookshelves, three coats, and I carried it home yesterday afternoon. It was a formidable journey but your lion won through. In my opinion it looks quite pleasant beside the window with books in and the silver lustre sugar bowl and ideal servant jug on it. If you don't like it, however, we can easily get rid of it, when you come.
      The flowers are all doing well--I watered them immediately on my return yesterday.
      Molly, Ricky, and Paul are all shockingly poor but otherwise well. They may to give up their flat in the near future. Ricky has agree to put in the shelves in the niche when we want them and Paul has some prospect of selling some textile designs but there is nothing at all definite.
      I have written a new 100 line poem which I am tinkering with in any odd moments that I get.
      You are in my mind all the time and I wish I were free to write you at the length Cupid and I wish. However that is not possible today for, apart from the lecture, I must get a dinner for four. Hetty is busy on it already and Dandy cannot leave her too long in the kitchen. I think the symbolic red ribband on the typewriter looks pretty. I love you, my darling cat, my rose, my Minerva. Take care of yourself and do not overwork as you are not fully well. I love you, Lawrence

    annotation_text: "8 viii 1950                Blackheath\nDearest Sylvia,\nThank
      you so much for your letter this morning. I am most disturbed to hear that you
      are not well yet. I hope that you are managing to sleep fairly long hours. As
      you say, you will surely be well this month.\nThe flat is rather bare at present
      as I have taken down most of your pictures: my parents are coming this evening,
      and Betty. I have emptied the cupboard in the kitchen and, nearer the time of
      their arrival, I shall put the large ones in there for the evening. They will
      be unharmed for there is plenty of room. I do like more than ever your Ajax
      and the Poet, seeing it again after a weekend away from it. \nI have been working
      on tomorrow's lecture, using Antal, making a lot of notes which I shall type
      out after this. I begin to know a little about early Florentine art, supplementing
      what you have previously told me. I remember again, so vividly, Spinello Aretino's
      superb frescoes in S. Miniato. Do you remember? I got some photographs while
      you painted Florence. \nOver the weekend Betty and I painted the bookshelves,
      three coats, and I carried it home yesterday afternoon. It was a formidable
      journey but your lion won through. In my opinion it looks quite pleasant beside
      the window with books in and the silver lustre sugar bowl and ideal servant
      jug on it. If you don't like it, however, we can easily get rid of it, when
      you come.\nThe flowers are all doing well-I watered them immediately on my return
      yesterday.\nMolly, Ricky, and Paul are all shockingly poor but otherwise well.
      They may have to give up their flat in the near future. Ricky has agreed to
      put in the shelves in the niche when we want them and Paul has some prospect
      of selling some textile designs but there is nothing at all definite.\nI have
      written a new 100 line poem which I am tinkering with in any moments that I
      get.\nYou are in my mind all the time and I wish I were free to write you at
      the length Cupid and I wish. However that is not possible today for, apart from
      the lecture, I must get a dinner for four. Hetty is busy on it already and Dandy
      cannot leave her too long in the kitchen. I think the symbolic red ribband on
      the typewriter looks pretty. I love you, my darling cat, my rose, my Minerva.
      Take care of yourself and do not overwork as you are not fully well. I love
      you\nLawrence"

      8 viii 1950      Blackheath
      Dearest Sylvia,
      Thank you so much for your letter this morning.  I am most
      disturbed to hear that you are not well yet.  I hope that you
      are managing to sleep fairly long hours.  As you say, you will
      surely be well this month.
      The flat is rather bare at present as I have taken down most
      of your pictures: my parents are coming this evening, and Betty.
      I have emptied the cupboard in the kitchen and, nearer the time
      of their arrival, I shall put the large ones in there for the
      evening.  They will be unharmed for there is plenty of room.
      I do like more than ever your Ajax and the Poet, seeing it a-
      gain after a weekend away from it.
      I have been working on tomorrow's lecture, using Antal, mak-
      ing a lot of notes which I shall type out after this.  I begin
      to know a little about early Florentine art, supplementing what
      you have previously told me.  I remember again, so vividly,
      Spinello Aretino's superb frescoes in S. Miniato.  Do you re-
      member? I got some photographs while you painted Florence.
      Over the weekend Betty and I painted the bookshelves, three
      coats, and I carried it home yesterday afternoon.  It was a for-
      midable journey but your lion won through.  In my opinion it
      looks quite pleasant beside the window with books in and the
      silver lustre sugar bowl and ideal servant jug on it.  If you
      don't like it, however, we can easily get rid of it, when you come.
      The flowers are all doing well- I watered them immediately
      on my return yesterday.
      Molly, Ricky, and Paul are all shockingly poor but otherwise
      well.  They may have to give up their flat in the new future.
      Ricky has agreed to put in the shelves in the niche when we want
      them and Paul has some prospect of selling some textile designs
      but there is nothing at all definite.
      I have written a new 100 line poem which I am tinkering with
      in any odd moments that I get.
      You are in my mind all the time and I wish I were free to write
      you at the length Cupid and I wish.  However that is not possible
      today for, apart from the lecture, I must get a dinner for
      four.  Hetty is busy on it already and Dandy cannot leave her

      the typewriter looks pretty.  I love you, my darling cat, my
