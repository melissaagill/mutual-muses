      Birmingham Station
      Saturday
      Dearest Sylvia -
      How happy you made me in the short time we had together - so long if measured in terms of happiness for me. Alas that I was sometimes jealous - but I shall look at your new pictures and see your creative pleasure in them. I adore you - dearest Sylvia - so passionately.

      I hope that your lecture on Friday was a success. I have no dubts but it was. Tell me all about it - a full report, please, because the shadowy - platonic - lion is still with you, adores you too much to leave you even long enough to tell the earthly Dandy lion about your lecture. My lecture was, I thik, very pleasant - and we had some discussion, this time.

      The young man at Birmingham who flirted with you was not Sartres - but Kenneth Garlic(k), who is now at the Barber Institute. He and Peter Kelly - the new assistant at the Barber - both came to my lecture - Garlic complementing me on it. He showed me round the Barber this morning - I wish you have had been there because he is charming and would have been very attentive to you - I am sure. And, how the pictures reminded me of our visits and of the Bellinis at Venice! Beckford's gold tea-pot was there - alas the handle is somewhat clumsy.
      IN THE TRAIN
      There is an unpleasant whitish fog here - so I have been lost several times - rather as on our own visit, here. I do hope that your journey yesterday was satisfactory & judgling from the weather then you would have been alright.

      enough to tell the earthly Dandy lion about your lecture.
      My lecture was, I think, very pleasant - and we had some
      discussion, this time.
      The young man at Birmingham who flirted with you was not
