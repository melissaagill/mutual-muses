      12-10-51  Pett  Dearest Lawrence,
      Thank you for your charming letter
      and highly evocative sketches -
      most pleasing; But I do hope
      Dandy's cold is better I'm so sorry
      he has had one - The weather has
      been divinely sunny here with no
      mists - I fear that it is tiredness
      and the damp.  I wish I could
      come and see you - but fear I cannot
      at present - Tiny being away I
      feel I should stay especially as
      Clifford is working so hard - how-
      ever I'll see what can be done.
      I am glad that you have been
      so industrious at letter [unclear][/unclear]
      and I hope you will have some luk.
      I am very glad about the Tate,
      it is rather pleasent I think -
      and I hope to hear some of the lectures

      weather has<br/>been divinely sunny here with no<br/>mists.  I fear that it
      is tiredness<br/>and the damp.  I wish I could<br/>come and see you--but fear
      I cannot<br/>at present.  Tiny  being away I<br/>feel I should stay especially
      as<br/>Clifford is working so hard--how-<br/>ever I'll see what can be done.<br/>I
      am glad that you have been<br/>so  at letter <br/>and I hope you will have some
      luck.<br/>I am very glad about the Tate.<br/>It is rather pleasant I think,<br/>and
      I hope to hear some of the <br/>lectures.
