          A hurried note to say that I shall not be coming on wednesday as, thank heaven, our tenants have paid. I am sorry not to see you, but it would be rather a rush. Michael will not be coming either for he will not go through London if I do not go with him., but by ferry - I made a mistake. M. is looking for a room in Cambridge.
          I haven't of course, quite finished my lecture so I must do so now! I will bring [unclear]Hetty[/unclear] my notes to see.  I do not think it learned enough for the L. I. but  it might do for the young lions section!
          I'm sure now that [unclear]Parsn's[/unclear] is a 'wet'!

      have paid. I am sorry not to see you, but it would be rather a rush. Michael
      will not be coming either for he will not go through London if I do not go with
      him; but by Terry-I made a mistake. M. is looking for a room in Cambridge.\nI
      haven't, of course, quite finished my lecture so I must do so now! I will bring
      Hetty my notes to see. I do not think it learned enough for the L. I. but it
      might do for the young lion's section!\nI'm sure now that Parson's is a 'wet'!\nYou
      may be disappointed by my latest picture as in drawing"
