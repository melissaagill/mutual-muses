      2 these were expensive cinemas, at least a dollar in those days! Clifford has sent an explanation of sublimation which he read to me and seems very clear, he's working like mad on the journal. Haue is still very ill, and to make things worse there is an action going on, or rather about to go on, in New Zealand against the man who circulates the journal there. To compensate Clifford has had a very nice and flattering letter from Harry Benjamin, and Leofelt (?) in doing "question and answers"
      Tiny will be at Eastbourne with her mother while you are here she is very sorry, so am I.
      This morning I went to the shore and got on with my painting. I have finished the Cliff now, it is going rather slowly as there is so much structural detail and shore a subtle reuse of colour

      This morning I went to the shore and got on with my painting. I have finished the Cliff now - it is going rather slowly as there is so much structural detail and such a subtle range of colours
