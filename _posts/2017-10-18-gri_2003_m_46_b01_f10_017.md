      disguise it by an apology.  You must not do this.  It does show the result of the undermining which Michael did.  I am desperate to collaborate with you.  We, and the public, will gain, gain so much.

      It is 9.20 in the morning and the sun is quite bright.  I hope it is nice at Pett and that you get the chance to paint.  You sound productive again: I need not tell you how glad I am.

      I have read your letter which came this morning four or give times already.

      How are you today?

      I love you, I love you,

      Lawrence

      Here is Dandylion reading MSS nobody has looked at for years - hence he doesn't.
