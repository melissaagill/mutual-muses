      FIVE POEMS FOR SYLVIA'S FAVOUR
      I
      Delicate confessions of shadow
      Along the marshes make certain of evening
      And its crisp chinoiserie of hawthorn
      Reminds - you are a painter

      But leave this landscape for a time
      Without regret or fear take the voyage
      which will unite our separated loves.
      And may this journey presage the future

      II CALYPSO
      Sylvia is coming to London,
      " " " " "
      Get out the roses the owls and the trumpets,
      Make a mighty fanfare for Sylvia

      Sylvia is coming by roadway,
      " " " " "
      Wrap the shipping lines and aeroplanes in black;
      Tell Mr. Ford, better wear his new suit.

      Sylvia is wearing her new dress,
      " " " " " "
      Tell all the women they needn't get up,
      'Cause nobody 'll notice them today.

      Sylvia's going to meet me,
      " " " " "
      And Sylvia's bringing a fine gift -
      It is her body and incomperable smile.
