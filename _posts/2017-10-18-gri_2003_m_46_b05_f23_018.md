      Dearest Lawrence
      I think my show is a great success socially, and financially it has made 9/6 so far - and there is still time to go.  R. and A. has been much admired but there are still a few little things that need doing to it and a Mr Bronsky who seems knowledge-able thinks that I need to simplify the beach more and I think he's right.  However I shall look hard at it for sometime before doing anything.
      John is working on a ballet of his called "Piccadilly" I think I told you about it!
      I hope your son's lecture was well attended - I should very much like to have heard it.

      Poronsky who seems knowledge-
      able thinks that I need to
      [unclear]simplify[/unclear] the beach more and
      I think he's right. However
      I shall look hard at it for
      sometime before doing anything.
      John is working on a bellet
      of his called "Piccadilly". I
      think I told you about it!
      I hope your [unclear]Jones[/unclear] lecture
      was well attended - I should
