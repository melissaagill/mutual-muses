      3  beach picture, but I don't feel very energetic today it seems rather "heavy" inspite of not being very warm.

      8 o'clock by 2.45 it had cleared up considerably and remained pleasant so I did go off to the beach after all - but by the time  I was ready it was about 3.15 and I was afraid the tide would be right out so I went without much hope, but after all it was quite nice so  rushed in and had a swim and rushed out and painted like mad for more than an hour - so unless I see some little thing that needs correction  have finished it and am very gland and relieved - I thought of you and wondered whether you were lecturing.   I miss you so much, especially when I do things we have just done together.

    clean_transcription: beach picture, but I don't feel very energetic today it seems
      rather "heavy" in spite of not being very warm. <br/>8 o'clock by 2.45 it had
      cleared up considerably and remained pleasant so I did go off to the beach after
      all - but by the time I was ready it was about 3.15 and I was afraid the tide
      would be right out so I went without much hope, but after all it was quite nice
      so I rushed in and had a swim and rushed out and painted like mad for more than
      an hour - so unless I see some little thing that needs correction I have finished
      it and am very glad and relieved - I thought of you and wondered whether you
      were lecturing. I miss you so much especially when I do things we have just
      done together
