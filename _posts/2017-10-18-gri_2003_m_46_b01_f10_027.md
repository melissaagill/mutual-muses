    annotation_text: "8th November 1948                    Wimbledon.\nDearest Sylvia,\nI
      have been looking   through all your paintings which I possess. The earliest
      is the sheet of Sylvia Sleigh note-paper with two sketches of me on it. They
      are not as confident as your work is now but I am very attached to them. As
      you know I adore the Trees at Pett but think the picture of Marion, which you
      gave me at the same time, is good, too. Taken with the flowers and the owls
      ( who are really fluffy white flowers themselves) in your letters and your superb
      new rose picture I have examples of your landscape, portraiture, and still-life.
      Not still-life, really, since much vitality and tenderness make them full of
      life. There is a verse of Mallarme's which sums up something of the quality
      of your roses and their meaning for they are symbolic as well as an enchanting
      painting.\n\nCes roses, muettes pour dire\nNotre absence, elles du moin\nA lui
      pareilles sont t√©moins\nDe votre conjugal sourire\n\nAnd your view of Fairlight,
      It is exactly the view that one would get from window of the Rectory that you
      panted with remarkable vitality. I often think of your nude self-portrait, against
      the light, for it expresses so much of you and though I believe you criticise
      it a bit technically now it is a splendid interpretation of yourself. Can I
      see it again at the weekend please?\nWhen we are together I will buy you huge
      canvases and run up and down the ladder for you with cans of paint and big brushes.\nHogarth's
      marriage to Jane Thornhill made a painter of him and his sexual tenderness is
      expressed in the conversation pieces. I am writing this chapter now so I cannot
      help thinking of a parallel. We can do so much mutually. I love you so. \nEven
      as you write about Michael you express doubts of the value of his words. His
      reasoning - 'Lawrence is young, you are my life' - still contains, do you see
      it? the reference to Time with which he hunted you before. Imagine life if you
      stay with Michael: apart from the threat of time you would again be dependent
      on his queer spasmodic love, entangled with possessiveness, the expressions
      of which, as you told me, are ungentle. What would happen to your painting which
      is another way of saying what would happen to you? It would be life without
      me. If you stay\n \n"

      8th November 1948
      Wimbledon

      Dearest Sylvia,

      I have been looking through all your paintings which I possess. The earliest is he sheet of Sylvia Sleigh note paper with two sketches of me on it. They are not as confident as your work is now but I am very attached to them. As you know, I adore the Trees at Pett, but I think the picture of Marion, which you gave me at the same time, is good too. Taken with the flowers and the owls (who are really fluffy white flowers themselves) in your letters and your superb new rose picture, I have examples of your landscape, portraiture and still life. Not still life, really, since such vitality and tenderness make them full of life. There is a verse of Mallarme's which sums up something of the quality of your roses and their meaning, for they are symbolic as well as an enchanting painting.

      Ces roses, muettes pour dire
      Notre absence, elles du moin
      A lui pareilles sont temoins
      De votre conjugal sourire.

      And your view of Fairlight. It is exactly the view that one would get from the window of the Rectory that you painted with remarkable vitality. I often think of your nude self-portrait, against the light, for it expresses so much of you and though I believe you criticize it a bit technically now, it is a splendid interpretation of yourself. Can I see it again next weekend, please?

      When we are together, I will buy you huge canvases and run up and down the ladder for you with cans of paint and new big brushes.

      Hogarth's marriage to Jane Thornhill made a painter of him and his sexual tenderness is expressed in the conversation pieces. I am writing this chapter now so I cannot help thinking of a parallel. We can do so much mutually. I love you so.

      Even as you write about Michael, you express doubt of the value of his words. His reasoning - 'Lawrence is young, you are my life' - still contains, do you see it? the reference to Time with which he hunted you before.

      have been looking through all your paintings which I possess. The earliest is
      he sheet of Sylvia Sleigh note paper with two sketches of me on it. They are
      not as confident as your work is now but I am very attached to them. As you
      know, I adore the Trees at Pett, but I think the picture of Marion, which you
      gave me at the same time, is good too. Taken with the flowers and the owls (who
      are really fluffy white flowers themselves) in your letters and your superb
      new rose picture, I have examples of your landscape, portraiture and still life.
      Not still life, really, since such vitality and tenderness make them full of
      life. There is a verse of Mallarme''s which sums up something of the quality
      of your roses and their meaning, for they are symbolic as well as an enchanting
      painting.<br/><br/>Ces roses, muettes pour dire<br/>Notre absence, elles du
      moin<br/>A lui pareilles sont temoins<br/>De votre conjugal sourire.<br/><br/>And
      your view of Fairlight. It is exactly the view that one would get from the window
      of the Rectory that you painted with remarkable vitality. I often think of your
      nude self-portrait, against the light, for it expresses so much of you and though
      I believe you criticize it a bit technically now, it is a splendid interpretation
      of yourself. Can I see it again next weekend, please?<br/><br/>When we are together,
      I will buy you huge canvases and run up and down the ladder for you with cans
      of paint and new big brushes.<br/><br/>Hogarth''s marriage to Jane Thornhill
      made a painter of him and his sexual tenderness is expressed in the conversation
      pieces. I am writing this chapter now so I cannot help thinking of a parallel.
      We can do so much mutually. I love you so.<br/><br/>Even as you write about
      Michael, you express doubt of the value of his words. His reasoning - ''Lawrence
      is young, you are my life'' - still contains, do you see it? the reference to
