      No news?  but items make themselves
      For the pleasure of being told,
      Of entering your rocaille ear.
      In a solvent universe
      Images and facts are clear -
      Like stars or apples the nights unfold.

      Seldom has eloped with Who:
      In the couch of Thursday Time
      Had a visit from Desire;
      How they wrestled and turned blue
      Like an anchor in the fire.
      Have you heard about the Crime?

      Geography has threatened Love
      With a hand of winds that blow
      White shadows on the mail.
      You know about the long-lost glove?
      And the total of the sale
      Of work by G. D. Tiepolo.

      In the Street of Afternoon I sensed
      A purple water cart who wept
      Was the Old King without his balls.
      Logic is banned during silence
      At St. Ping-Pong-outside-the-Walls,
      I said to myself in the crypt.

      Such is the news or some of the news
      And who can say all news is good
      Or that bad news is the end,
      News is old and new and not news,
      But first, though last here, that I send
      Is the state of love that feels good.

      And an Emblem:

      No news?  but items make themselves
      For the pleasure of being told,
      Of entering your rocaille ear.
      In a solvent universe
      Images and facts are clear -
      Like stars crapples the nights unfold.

      Seldom has cloped with Who:
      In the couch of Thursday Time
      Had a visit from Desire;
      How they wrestled and turned blue
      Like an anchor in the fire.
      Have you heard about the Crime?

      Geography has threatened Love
      With a hand of winds that blow
      White shadows on the mail.
      You know about the long-lost glove?
      And the total of the sale?
      Of work by G. D. Tiepolo.

      In the street of Afternoon I sensed
      A purple water cart who wept
      Was the Old King without his balls.
      Logic is banned during silence
      At St. Ping-Pong-oitside-the -Walls,
      I said to myself in the crypt.

      Such is the news of some of the news
      And who can say all news is good
      Or that bad news is the end,
      News is old and new and not news,
      But first, though last here, that I send
      Is the state of love that feels good.

      And an Emblem:
