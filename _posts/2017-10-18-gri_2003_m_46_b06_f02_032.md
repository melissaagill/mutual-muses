      Dearest Sylvia

      The measurements of Tiny Tots are 20x16 ins.
      It is terrible that you are sleeping so badly.
      might a mild drug not help you to break the [unclear]series[/unclear]? I hate to think of you sleepless at
      night, my love. I hope, I hope that you will
      soon sleep better.

      M has sent me 50 envelopes which will en-
      able me to make a start. My list is rather [unclear]impos-
      ing[/unclear] and contains more names than 50. If
      you remember that I am doing all in my power
      to make your exhibition a success perhaps you
      will feel better. My list includes ICA, SEA,
      Arts Council, V&A, Hodder & Stoughton, CAS, &
      individual critics. I am writing especially
      to the art ed. of Modern Woman, too.

      I do not know Paul S's address but I am
      seeing him on Monday. Paul H's address at
      the moment is 14 Gayton Crescent, Hampstead.

      By the way, I think you should write to
      Iris on Brit. and Eve. I think it would be
      better from you than from me - for several reasons.

      The address is 1 [unclear]Finlay[/unclear]: B&E 196 Stand W C 2
