      3    but it does not make me happy
      I like your Moses poem.  I like
      particularly the 2nd couplet.  Why
      do "poets never have to blot"
      I'm sorry poor Dandy had to run
      down stairs only to receive such
      a grumpy letter!
      I have not heard from the Clarks
      yet.  Thank you for sending Miss letter.
      He noted that Tiny never seems so
      happy now as when is with her
      family, Clifford bored.  I don't
      blame him.
      I long to see you again dearest
      Lawrence to hold you in very areus
      and stroke your hair.
      I love you
      Sylvia
