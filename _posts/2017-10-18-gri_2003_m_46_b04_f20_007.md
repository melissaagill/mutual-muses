      14-8-51

      Dearest Lawrence,

      I hope that you had a pleasant day and a useful one - and that your family were helpful and kindly disposed. I wonder if you went to the Festival this morning - it was fairly fine until about 12.30 here there have been heavy showers and now it is grey. I am going to do some washing this afternoon. I pottered and talked to Tiny this morning. We had a very pleasant time in Brighton - my train was rather slow so that I did not arrive until about 10.45. - I found them all waiting for me. We enjoyed the Lawrence very much - there was a very interesting painting of Nash - and some drawings of the Pavilion by Nash, Grace and Pufin - some of these lent

      had a pleasant<br/>day and a useful one - and<br/>that your family were helpful<br/>and
      kindly disposed. I wonder<br/>if you went to the Festival this<br/>morning -
      it was fairly fine until<br/>about 12.30 here there have been<br/>heavy showers
      and now it is<br/>grey. I am going to do some<br/>washing this afternoon - I
      pottered<br/>and talked to Sing this morning.<br/>We had a very pleasant time
      in<br/>Brighton - my train was rather<br/>slow so that I did not arrive<br/>until
      about 10.45. I found <br/>them all waiting for me. We enjoyed<br/>the Lawrence
      very much. There was<br/>a very interesting portrait of<br/>Nash - and some
