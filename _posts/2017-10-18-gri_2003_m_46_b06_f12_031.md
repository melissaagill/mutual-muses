      Mother & Father are less rushed & overworked than when the Bath people are here so I am glad about that side of the holiday.
      I haven't been out since Christmas morning and I think that the rest, the good meals & complete absence of intelligent thought has done me good - even if it hasn't, I feel good.
      I am more pleased than I can say that the Chepstow Road deal has advanced another step. Marvellous. Do you know when the present owners are leaving so that we can start moving in? And has Mrs Clark replied to your offer of a flat there?
      Tell me as soon as you can when you will be meeting Dannatt.
      I love you darling. Once again let me hope your Xmas was happy. I missed you very much.
      Love you
      Lawrence

      Bath people  are  here so I am glad about that side<br/>of the holiday.<br/>I
      haven't been out since  Christmas  morning & I think that<br/>the rest, the
      good  meals,, & complete absence of  intelligent<br/>thought has done me good
      - even if it hasn't, I feel good.<br/>I am more pleased than I can say that
      the Chepstow Road<br/>deal has advanced  another step. marvellous. Do <br/>you
      know when the present owners are leaving do that <br/>we can start moving in?
