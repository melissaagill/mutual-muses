      Pett 7.7.52

      Dearest Lawrence,
      May I start by the dull arrangements and requests! First - Did I leave my little seed pearls in the cupboard or in my drawer? I can't find them so I hope so. Second, please will you bring the small piece of wood on which I pined the bad self-portrait- with the Easter Egg - it belongs to a frame in which I have put "the fig-free" and having it out of the way. If it is convenient & using any frames do - particularly "megawatts" - or [unclear][/unclear] it was [unclear][/unclear] round that picture - but it is not important.
