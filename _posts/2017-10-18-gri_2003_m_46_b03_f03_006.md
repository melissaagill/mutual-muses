      London     2-11-1950
      Dearest Sylvia,
      I will make a start on this letter now and finish it later for I have to give the first of today's two lectures in about 15 minutes. I am writing standing up in the Charing X Post Office.
      Your two letters came today and pleased me very much, lightening the darkness of getting up so early for a 10 o'clock lecture. You have been busy with [unclear][/unclear] and I look forward to seeing what you've done. Or, better still, hearing it.
      I'm glad you heard Antigone-as you know it is a favorite piece of mine though discussion on 'integrity' afterwards seems like shutting the stable door when the race-horse 'Integrity' is gone. It is in its way-a final statement, don't you think. Good heavens-I must fly-to resume this note afterwards
