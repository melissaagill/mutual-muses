      VERSIONS OF CYTHERE

      What version of the island satisfies
      Our theory and our mood?  Remember, some
      Supposed it was a phallic crest surviving
      Elaborate sunken continents,
      Precipitous and guilty as a gibbet
      Caked with snow and with the wind raked.
      Blue noses not red lips and bones not breasts
      Spiky, not voluptuous on the shore
      Where dribbled or beat the sea, in mad extremes.

      Some wish it free of love's longer words,
      Its less peaceful because free of verbs,
      A concave in the sea, an azure dent
      Out of the wind, and well off the trade routes
      Where captains keep their logs and sailors spit,
      Responsible or merely animal:
      Under the raft of the horizon,
      The island slips, regressive involute,
      Diminishing in vacant fathoms.

      The island we select and have adored
      Has cliffs, but functional, set for a climb,
      Is tranquil, but not past the point of choice.
      Varieties of attitude like fruit
      Rise tumescent from the blossom,
      Above the knetted lovers, in their reach.
      Between retreat and death the island is
      A purple bed - an orchard
      Replenished by the lattitude of wishes.
      1-2 February.
