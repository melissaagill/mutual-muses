      III

      So many lamps
      That look back from our reflections

      Make water, urned hero:
      Water, make rivers.

      The lamps dive in the river, Can swim.
      Invisable clocks.  What is the time?
      A moment back there were crowds.
      Now there are two.  How many?
      Do not wake yet.  Let the mouse alone.
      I mend the pieces of Orphee.

      Swim where the river slides
      As if there were canoes
      Left in the museum of night
      The rivers cage the lamps
      Who burn like fish
      Luminous in the hoops of water

      Night reconciles the apple and the lamp
      And the sleeping dreaming creatures

      One more piece of news.  Ted has cut lots of hair off
      and the result is uncommonly successful.  Would you
      could see it now.

      I love you, dearest love.  Do you rest as you feel neural-
      gic.  I hope this passes off soon.  Poor darling.
      I think of you all the time, not only in the room, here,
      with all of your lovely pictures, but everywhere.  I
      so love you.
      You have all of Dandy's love
      Lawrence

      So many lamps
      That look back from our reflections

      Make water, urned hero:
      Water, make rivers.

      The lamps dive in the river, Can swim.
      Invisible clocks.  What is the time?
      A moment back there were crowds.
      Now there are two.  How many?
      Do not wake yet.  Let the mouse alone.
      I mend the pieces of Orpheo.

      Swim where the river slides
      As if there were canoes
      Left in the museum of night
      The rivers cage the lamps
      Who burn like fish
      Luminous in the hoops of water

      Night reconciles the apple and the lamp
      And the sleeping dreaming creatures

      One more piece of news.  Ted has cut lots of hair off
      and the result is uncommonly successful.   Would you could see it now.

      I love you, dearest love.  Do rest as you feel neural-gic.  I hope this passes off soon.  Poor darling.  I think of you all the time, not only in the room, here,
      with all your lovely pictures, but everywhere.  I
      so love you.
      You have all Dandy's love
