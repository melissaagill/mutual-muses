      and do my quota of painting.

      since Tiny has had tea with Miss Peace she has cleared up! It was so deadly. Miss P. tried to persuade T. to have a social in the Hall with tables and things - to bring the congregation together! She said of course she didn't enjoy these things but she and "Winnie" would come! You've seen the congregation - you've seen the hall - well!

      The one bright spot in the last day at [unclear]Dirchling[/unclear] (!) was that I flipped through a copy of "[unclear]Eastler[/unclear] Waters" - as it is a DO's book - and ended by becoming so enthralled that I quite forgot the tune - I missed my train - but as I had it [unclear]worth[/unclear] me I [unclear]bore[/unclear] the tedium of the slow train with equanimity.

      I have not other news, but how I love you. Dearest Lawrence I long to see you again.

      I love you,
      Sylvia
