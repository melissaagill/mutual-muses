      WIMbledon 1967
      11 MANSEL ROAD,
      WIMBLEDON, S.W.19

      3

      One of the new Burlingtons has a long
      article about cleaning in it. I have
      not read it yet but there appears
      (from the illustrations) to be a dis-
      cussion of a cleaned Giovanni Bellini,
      one included in the show - the altar-
      piece with the central landscape and
      numerous supplementary pictures.
      I don't think we realised that this
      had been newly cleaned.

      July 15th is the opening day of
      Artists of Fame and promise, though,
      of course, this is Part One only. You
      might be in Part Two. Perhaps the
      [unclear]Leicester[/unclear] will let you know in
      time which part it will be. I will
      tell Gainsborough I'd like to do it.

      Be sure to tell me the news of the
      Fete. It is as well Yawolla was
      abroad - don't you think, or he
      might have gone. On the other hand
