      2 V 1950
      Dearest Sylvia
      You may be pleased to hear that Lord Chesterfield said of Vergil: "he is often languid, especially in his last five or six books (of the AEneid), during which I am obliged to take a good deal of snuff."
      Many thanks for your letter - longer than usual, and so doubly welcome.
      Yes, if the carriers will unpack as well as deliver do have them do that, but if that is more than they are willing to do, by all means have them bring the pictures to me.
      I am very glad you have used this address for The Observer - I wonder why you think I should mind?
      Ray Howard-Jones is a woman not a man. I do not know if she is nicer than her name for I do not know how 'un-nice' the name is. She is an AIA committee member and a painter.
      How nice that you composed in your head another portrait. In my head, believe me, my darling, I am already sitting for it.
