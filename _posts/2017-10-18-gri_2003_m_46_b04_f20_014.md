      4  I think that you met Paul yesterday. I hope that he is well and that he has heard from Dundee. Do you think he will be at the Watergate on the 7th or 8th of September for I think the Woods would love  some tickets for the Revue-with you if possible! But perhaps this is too late. I enjoyed it so much. Charles' [unclear][/unclear] pictures sounds ghastly (I think there's a "U" in it somewhere!) The little ditty you were singing "Do I Love You" recurs continually in my mind. I do miss you. I love you so much-dear love look after yourself. I love you
      Sylvia P.S. my toe is much better. S. No I think 9th or 10th
