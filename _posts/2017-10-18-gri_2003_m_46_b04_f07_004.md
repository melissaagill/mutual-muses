      Dearest Sylvia,

      Thank you do much for your letter. As to the enclosures: it was thoughtful of you to spend the [unclear]Hasting[/unclear] receipt; and very amus-ing to send me, at Michael's suggestion (sur-prise!) an advertisement for a man between 30-35 (I'll try for it in 1957) to go to the Far East. Yes I would just like to go to the Far East: at least M is dopey enough to suppose so. He can write and he is a sub something if not a sub-editor - why doesn't he try. I enclose it. Draw his attention to it.

      Excellent news. You may remember that I once contested your judgment that Van Dyck's Cupid & Psyche (Hampton Court) was his best non-portrait. It has been cleaned and I now bow to your perception: it was in the basement of[unclear] the [/unclear] N.G. yesterday. The [unclear] color [/unclear] is [unclear] vanishing [/unclear] : the great [unclear][/unclear] & flashing green & Psyche's blue [unclear] drapey whitess [/unclear] & crisp. The drawing is fine now, also.

      THE SOCIETY FOR EDUCATION IN ART
      29 TAVISTOCK SQUARE LONON WC 1

      Dearest Sylvia,
      Thank you so much for your letter.  As
      to the enclosures:  it was thoughtful of you to
      spend the Hasting receipt; and very amus-
      ing to send me, at Michael's suggestion (sur-
      prise!) an advertisement for a man between
      30-35 (I'll try for in 1957) to go to
      the far East.  Yes I would just like to
      go to the far East:  at least M is dopey
      enough to suppose so.  He can write and he
      is a sub something if not a sub-editor--
      why doesn't he try.  I enclose it.  Draw
      his attention to it.
      Excellent news.  You may remember that
      I once [unclear][/unclear] your judgment that Van
      Dyck's copied of psyche (Hampton Court)
      was his best non-portrait.  It has been
      cloned and I now bow in your perception:
      it wasin the basement of the
      NG yesterday.  The color
      is ravishing:  the great tree
      was and flarling gree and psycho
      blue drapery whither and crisp.
      The drawing is fine now, also.

As to the enclosures: it was thoughtful of you to send the Hastings receipt; and very amusing to send me, at Michael's suggestion (surprise!) an advertisement for a man between 30-35 (I'll try for it in 1957) to go to the Far East. Yes I would lijke to go to the Far East: at least M is dopey enough to suppose so. He can write and he is a sub something if not a sub-editor - why doesn't he try. I enclose it. Draw his attention to it.
      Excellent news. You may remember that I once contested your judgement that Van Dyck's Cupid & Psych (Hampton Court) was his best non-portrait. It has been cleaned and I now bow to you your perception: it was in the basement of the N.G. yesterday. The colour is ravishing: the great tree was a flashing green & Psyche's blue drapery whitish & crisp. The drawing is fine now, also.
