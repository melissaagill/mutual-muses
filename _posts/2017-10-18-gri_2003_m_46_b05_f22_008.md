      3 I had no doubts about the latter, but some about the former at first as you remember. I hope perhaps you will like 'R. and A.' when I have finished it too. I had a very nice extremely helpful letter from Michael today. I think he is quite reconciled to the show and anxious that it should be successful.
      To-day I went up to Miss Campbell, and have almost finished the painting of her - and she has done a rather delightful one of me. Mine of her is one of those wretched things that look better near to - I am hoping I can correct it all up in the next sitting however. You will be amused to hear that she calls me "the blue tiger" I have been wearing my rummage stripes! She has many cats and they are all very friendly one landed right on my palatte

         To-day I went up to Miss

      the painting of her -- and she
      has done a rather delightful one
