      3rd January 1948  Wimbledon

      Dearest Sylvia,
      I want to send you hastily these poems so that they arrive before you leave.

      Painting and Poetry
      Are sisters, Dryden said:
      In pictures you shall see
      The image you have read.

      Then poetry may dare
      To be your counterpart:
      O may my poems share
      The beauty of your art.

      ii
      Blackberry leaves, exquisite
      As signals to the butterfly:
      And roses in cut-glass
      Give to blood a petalled form.

      These flowers that you paint
      Curve with the line  of life,
      Creative, warm, - like roses
      Answering Orpheus.

      iii
      The figure of a lady standing
      Beside an easel, palette in her hand,
      With neo-classic draperies stirred
      By an inventive wind, her brushes
      Held as lightly as a fan at dances:
      She is the muse of painting, or she was.

      But I have seen a painter, sitting
      Before her easel, sometimes spilling
      The turpentine or working days upon
      Imperfect forms until they please,
      Wearing a sweater and a skirt.
      And she too has a garland in her hair.

      The first stanza of the third poem describes a Muse from a late 18th century engraving.

      I long to see you on Wednesday, dearest.  Tickets, times, accommodation at Bilston, visit to the Barber Institute, are now fixed.  My thoughts are with you all the while.
      I love you
      Lawrence
