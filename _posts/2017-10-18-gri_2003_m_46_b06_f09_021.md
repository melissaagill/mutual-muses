      Dearest Sylvia

      John is going to see if he has any suitable jewellery. If he has I will let you know all details. He is making constructions that are very interesting and which I believe you will like - [unclear] Magda [/unclear] and John join me in awaiting you impatiently.
      Frank and I have not found a good idea for the radio series yet but he hit on an idea for a children's two-sided record for Christmas. I [unclear] made [/unclear] it over the weekend. IC is Willie and the Magic Tune. The chief of H.M.V. is considering it already  and I shall know his verdict on Wednesday, probably.
      Magda took us all to see SHANE. It is wonderful. I hope that I shall be able to persuade you to see it. IC is a Western told with the technique (or some of it) of Eisenstein & Pudovkin. With all this Russian influence the director must be running a risk. Monumental, humane, violent, and full of mythology : waste land and various stuff, but well related to the realistic narrative! CV Wedgewood called it 'a boys film' : [unclear] have [/unclear] I news for CV Wedgewood!
      Though I am not modifying my opinion of Ustinov as a playwright I have to admit (having heard In All Directions) that he is a brilliant radio comedian - as script writer and player. (IC is on Monday evening at 9.30.)
      My next lecture is on Mathew Smith. I wish I liked him more; or I wish he were less good than he is. I don't know what I am going to say. Come 3.00 o'clock I shall think of something, I suppose.
      I have been very well fed in the last few days. I have been dining out ; it has all been ravishing and exotic.  So please have no fears on that score for your lion. Magda, Mathew and Geoffrey (last night) were the cooks. Geoffrey & his friend tried to make one miss the last train but happily I realised their intention just in time - and made it to the last train.  Young lion has escaped a fate worse than death. Hetty is happy to report.

    annotation_text: "15.9.53\n\nDearest Sylvia\n\nJohn is going to see if he has
      any suitable jewellery. If he has I will let you know all details. He is making
      constructions that are very interesting and which I believe you will like. Magda
      and John join me in awaiting you impatiently.\n\nFrank and I have not found
      a good idea for the radio series yet but he hit on an idea for a children's
      two-sided record for Christmas. I wrote it over the weekend. It is \"Willie
      and the Magic Tune.\"  The chief of H.M.V. is considering it already and I shall
      know his verdict on Wednesday, proabably.\n\nMagda took us all to see SHANE.
      It is wonderful. I hope that I shall be able to persuade you to see it. It is
      a Western told with the technique (or some of it) of Eisenstein and Pudovkin.
      With all this Russian influence the director must be running a risk. Monumental,
      humane, violet, and full of mythology: waste land and saviour stuff, but so
      well related to the realistic narrative!  C.V. Wedgewood called it 'a boy's
      film': have I news for C.V. Wedgewood!\n\nThough I am not modifying my opinion
      of Ustinov as a playwright I have to admit (having heard \"In All Directions\")
      that he is a brilliant radio comedian- as scriptwriter and player.  (It is on
      Monday evening at 9.30.)\n\nMy next lecture is on Mathew Smith. I wish I liked
      him more; or, I wish he were less good than he is. I don't know what I am going
      to say. Come 5.00  o'clock I shall think of something, I suppose.\n\nI have
      been very well fed in the last few days. I have been dining out: it has all
      been nourishing AND exotic. So please have no fear on that score for your lion.
      Magda, [unclear]Mattes,[/unclear] and Geoffrey (last night) were the cooks.
      Geoffry and his friend tried to make me miss the last train but happily I realised
      their inention just in time - and made it to the last train. You lion has escaped
      a fate worse than death and Hetty is happy to report. "
