      Blackheath
      2nd May 1952

      Dearest Sylvia,

      I am sorry to hear that you have not been able to save
      quite as you hoped to.  This effects, in a way, when you
      can come to Blackheath.  I shall have a cheque for 16 from
      the Tate Gallery during next week, but until then things are
      rather lean.  So rather than ask you to use some of your own
      money, you might prefer to come to me a few days later than
      Monday 5th.  On the other hand I do not like the idea of
      your being at Pett alone for too long so if you do come and
      we use your money I will pay you back when the cheque comes.

      Which would you prefer ?  As some of your money is in-
      volved in one course of action I must leave the decision to
      you.  If you come on Monday I am not certain that I can
      meet you for I have to go to Netheren, so, perhaps, if you
      decide to come early in the week, you would make it Tues-
      day when I could meet you at any time.

      I have been writing our operetta gain:  I have revised and improved the conversation of Pomona and tartaglia and
      given them each a song.  I enclose the City Poem:  perhaps
      you would return it when you come to town for at the moment
      it is the only copy.  If you like it enough I will always
      type it again for you.

      You ask after Iris.  I saw her last night.  I am going
      to send to her editor a synopsis about Westerns.  Iris is
      keen on the idea and she now has to convince the editor it
      is a good idea.  If that happens I shall go ahead and write
      the article.  By the way, she is the I. Furlong who contri-
      butes a review to Art News and Review this week:  she has just
      started doing pieces for Gainsborough.  By the way, I am
      reviewing the new Pasmores.

      On Tuesday my lecture was called Sculpture:  I lectured on
      Lord Leighton, Degas, and Renoir (three painter-sculptors!).
      Yesterday it was Modern British Portraits (well-attended to
      my surprise):  John, Wyndham Lewis, Graham Bell, and Coldstream.
      I hope that the play goes well tonight.  I shall think of
      you, imperious in the wings, with paws full of manuscript.

      Blackheath
      2nd May 1952

      Dearest Sylvia,
      I am sorry to hear that you have not been able to save quite as you hoped to. This effects, in a way, when you can come to Blackheath. I shall have a cheque for £16 from the Tate Gallery during next week, but until then things are rather lean. So rather than ask you to use some of your own money, you might prefer to come to see me a few days later than Monday 5th. On the other hand I do not like the idea of your being at Pett alone for too long so if you do come and we use your money I will pay you back when the cheque comes.
      Which would you prefer? As some of your money is in-volved in one course of action I must leave the decision to you. If you come on Monday I am not certain that I can meet you for I have to go to Netherne, so, perhaps, if you decide to come early in the week, you would make it Tues-day when I could meet you at any time.

      I hope you may be in town so we can both join the Woods at Roses. If not, however, I will meet them there as you suggest. It was on the 8th wasn't it: and at what time?

      I have been writing our operetta again: I have revised and improved the conversation of Pomona and Tartaglia and given them each a song. I enclose the City poem: perhaps you would return it when you come to town for at the moment it is the only copy. If you like it enough I will always type it again for you.

      You ask after Iris. I saw her again last night. I am going to send her editor a synopsis about Westerns. Iris is keen on the idea and she now has to convince the editor it is a good idea. If that happens I shall go ahead and write the article. By the way, she is the I. Furlong who contri-butes a review to Art News and Review this week: she has just started doing pieces for Gainsborough. By the way, I am reviewing the new Pasmores.

      On Tuesday my lecture was called Sculpture: I lectured on Lord Leighton, Degas and Renoir (three painter- sculptors!). Yesterday it was Modern British Portraits (well attended to my surprise): John, Wyndham Lewis, Graham Bell, and Coldstream.

      I hope that the play goes well tonight. I shall think of you, imperious on the wings, with paws full of manuscript. If we should not be able to celebrate your birthday on the day we will do so as soon as you come to town.

      I love you
