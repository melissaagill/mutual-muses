      IV

      Dearest.  Thank you for appreciating my poems as you do.  It arouses in me an urge to write more about you.  Your description of the result of my "gifts" as you sweetly called them upon you was exquisite.  I never want to hear again that you cannot write letters.

      Your account of Windy Ways' interior was very cleverly done, too, so again, no more Cinderella stories about your letter craft.  It does sound - remarkable.  What courage the people who live there have to juxtapose such "unexpected" pieces.

      What can I tell you about tea with C. [unclear]Solmon[/unclear]?  I kept him off [unclear]aunts[/unclear] and he looked at the Vienna catalogue with great interest and that really is all I can remember.  He showed me one or two drawings[unclear]![/unclear]  But that's all.  Wilson seems to have heard some of my lecture but [unclear]Solmon[/unclear] won't commit himself.

      To develop a theme of yours in your letter of the 27th I must say that my recent past is congenial and indeed of great interest now.  I go back over places we have been to and things we have said.  I associate you with the N.P.G. of course, and also with [unclear]Oxford[/unclear] Street above [unclear]Liberty's[/unclear] where we argued once; with Toynbee Hall, and the pub, and also the Royal Cinema in [unclear]Edgeware[/unclear] Road.  Oh an so many more: place names, images, phrases, subjects, whole conversations come back - occupy me.  With you at the center of them all.  And yet, counter to this, the warm anticipation of our next meeting: counter to it and part of it for you have abolished conventional distinctions of time.  There is only you, sweetest, dearest, Sylvia.

      I adore you, Sylvia.

      Passionately,  Lawrence
