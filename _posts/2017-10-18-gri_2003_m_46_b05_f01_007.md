      1st sketch of the fairy tale in your letter of 1-[unclear]9[/unclear]-52.

      I
      An afternoon lined in the day
      That afternoon a [unclear]paperjay[/unclear]
      Led a girl out of the house
      Into gardens of the day.

      The song lured the princess on.
      The girl was a princess. The sun
      Was a rose she tried to read
      Lured by the darting paperjay.

      She was lost in the languorous dark
      On the outskirts of the park.
      The grass held no statues
      [unclear]Like[/unclear] [unclear]ill[/unclear] lawns near her father's house.

      II
      Where are [unclear]Ronne[/unclear] [unclear]Bids[/unclear]
      And the beautiful cat?
      The paperjay is lost
      In dusky silence.
      I am lost.
      Am I remembered
      By the beautiful cat & sweet Bonne [unclear]Biche[/unclear]?

      III
      With sombre and dragging ration,
      Unlike the girlish flight
      When she followed the paperjay
      As if she were an echo
      Who never catches the singer,
      She returns, perched on the scaly dome,
      On the old grey shield, of a tortoise-back.
      In sluggish ceremony she returns -
      Like a diver slowly rising
      From the languorous bed to air.

      With [unclear]it[/unclear] stay embroidered on his arms
      A gallant prince waits for the girl:
      "Who is Bonne [unclear]Biche[/unclear] but the beautiful queen
      Finely poised as Fame, waiting for me?"

      The spell completes its circle like a tapestry,
      A rose stitched by the seasons and desire
      Of a girl between the past and the future.

      I love you,
      Lawrence

      1st Sketch of the Fairy Tale in your letter of 1-3-52
      I
      An afternoon lived in the day
      That afternoon a popinjay
      Led a girl out of the house
      Into gardens of the day.

      The song lured the princess on.
      The girl was a princess - The sun
      Was a rose she tried to read
      Lured by the darting popinjay

      She was lost in the langorous dark
      On the outskirts of the park.
      The grass held no statues
      [unclear][/unclear] the lawns near her father's house.

      II
      Where are Bonne Biches
      And the beautiful cat?
      The popinjay is lost
      In dusly silence.
      I am lost.
      Am I remembered
      By the beautiful cat & sweet Bonne Biches?

      III
      With sombre and dragging motions,
      Unlike the girlish flight
      When she followed the popinjay
      As if she were an echo
      Who never catches the singer,
      She returns, perched on the scaly dome,
      On the old grey shield, of a tortoise - back.
      In sluggish ceremony she returns -
      like a [unclear][/unclear] slowly rising
      From the langorous bed to air.

      With a stay embroidered on his arms
      A gallant prince waits for the girl:
      "Who is Bonne Birche but the beautiful queen?"
      "Poised to Fame, waiting for me?"

      The spell completes its circle like a tapestry,
      A rose stitched by the seasons and desire
      Of a girl between the past and future.

      I love you

      1st sketch of the fairytale in your letter of 1.7.52

      I
      An afternoon lived in the day.
      That afternoon a popinjay
      Led a girl out of the house
      Into gardens of the day.

      The song lured the princess on.
      The girl was a princess. The sun
      Was a rose she tried to reach
      lured by the darting popinjay

      She was lost in the dangerous dark
      On the outskirts of the park.
      The grass held no statues
      With the lawns near her father's house.

      II
      Where are Bonne Biche
      And the beautiful cat?
      The popinjay is lost
      In dusky silence.
      I am lost.
      Am I remembered
      By the beautiful cat & sweet Bonne Biche?

      III
      With sombre and dragging motion,
      Unlike the girlish flight
      When she followed the popinjay
      As if she were an echo
      Who never catches the singes,
      She returns, perched on the scaly dome,
      On the old grey shield, of a tortoise-back.
      In sluggish ceremony she returns -
      like a dines slowly rising.
      From the languorous bed to air.

      With a stay embroidered on his arms,
      A gallant prince waits for the girl:
      "Who is Bonne Biche but the beautiful queen
      "Finely poised as Fame, waiting for me?"

      The spell completes its circle like a tapestry,
      A rose stitched by the seasons and desire
      of a girl between the past and future.

      I love you
      Lawrence
