      Georgie has written to say they
      are better and when can I come-
      I could go on my way back if
      I knew, A. If I can come! and
      B. when I shall return - would it
      be Tuesday March the 11th do you
      think? Please let me know and I
      will let them know!
      I think you said that you were
      working on Athene this week? How
      is it going. Have you had any letters
      from the publishers yet? And you
      don't say how the I.C.A. meeting
      was?
      I am getting on with my picture
      above the work party! I have finish-
      ed the bottle part of it's reflection and
      the glass also the table. I am
      pleased with it. It is much easier
      than the large still-life I have been
