      carpet is faun with blue patterns and the walls yellowish I am afraid. Cheap day fares to London, incidentally, are available after 9.30 s we shall be able to go to the museums, &c., without bad expense. Breakfast is between 7.30 and 9.0 and dinner at 7.0. If there are other facts I have omitted tell me and I shall try to tell you.

      The New Burlington magazine is devoted mainly to Charles I. It is an exquisite delight to read the articles and look at the many busts and pictures of him. Such cavaliers as ourselves are wonderfully catered for and in the year ore such articles are promised.

      I hope you slept well last night darling and that you are very well. Phrases from Mrs Goodman keep coming into my head and I remember how beautifully you read it - in the gallery, in bed, in the train. My lyrical darling I adore you. I hope you finish your watercolour satisfactorily - I am confident you will.

      We were both right about the Greenwood Prize! The competition is closed by now BUT it has been extended until the end of February. So I shall not send in my Autumn Poem but an Epithalamium, a Portrait of Sylvia. I have made some notes already: you see, my Muse, how promptly your poet responds to your wishes. Our creative influence on each other is marvellous. I have managed to complete your Sestina also: it follows the letter. As you will notice - many of the images are derived from your ring, - Cupid, hand, &c.

      I love you my dearest Sylvia and I hope my thoughts and your knowledge of my love will make the next few days easy for you.

      I love you, Lawrence

      The plan is not complete I think, dais on two being missing &c.
