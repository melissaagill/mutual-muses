    annotation_text: manage to go to Brighton on Sunday. I should enquire before giving
      up the idea. Let me know how your bananas are. I hope you have some "Scheques".

      to be taken [unclear][/unclear] on June the 5th. I fear this is a very dull
      letter. But rest assured of my love. I love you, dearest one. I love you Sylvia
