      22 IX 52 Blackheath Dearest Sylvia,
      I enclose the 1st part of my sex lecture: it is a copy so do not return it.
      I hope you approve of it. The illustrations are only provisional at
      the moment and will probably also include Leonardo & del Sarto
      (E. Jones). As you cannot be present at least you shall know what I shall say.
      I shall go to bed soon: it is about 10:00 and I am tired after my S E A
      and V & A Day. Only four more nights and I shall se you again:
      only three more days, a moment less since I wrote your name at the
      head of this letter, my love, my Sylvia.
      Tomorrow I have the Degar lecture and in the evening I must visit
      Pasmores to talk over an essay with him, K. Martin, & J. Weekes (an
      architect). The other day I saw quite a lot of Mrs P, but the way, and
      she is charming, amiable, domestic. They have a boy of 11 and a girl
      a little younger (not 2 girls as I thought).
      Bed now. More tomorrow. I lvoe you. Goodnight.
      23 IX 52
      I hope you slept well, darling, last night. Lion did, though he got up
      early - just before 8:00 so as to do some work before going to town.
      As soon as I get to town I will enquire about the times of trains & tell
      you the one I shall probably catch on Friday morning: it is now only
      2 full days and 3 nights until we meet. (I wonder if you have heard
      when Chase is expected - and for how long.)
      I have no other news that I can think of at the moment.
      I love love love you
      Lawrence

      P.S. Train times are 10:25 from Charing Cross: 9:45 - 10:45 - 11:45
      from Victoria. I will be on one of the earlier ones - either the 10:15 from
      Charing Cross or, if C is ready to travel early, 9:45 or 10:45 from Victoria.
      If alone, I shall definetly be on 10:25: if with C I shall no wait later then 10:45.
      Love Lawrence

      Lawrence
      P.S. Train times are 10.25 fro Charing Cross : 9.45 - 10.45 - 11.45 from Victoria. I will be on one of the earlier one - either the 10.25 from Charing Cross, if C is ready to travel early, 9.45 or 10.45 from Victoria. If alone I shall definitely be on the 10.25 : if with C I shall not wait later than 10.45.
      Love Lawrence

      Dearest Sylvia,
      I enclose the 1st part of my sex lecture: it is a copy so do not return it. I hope you approve of it. The illustrations are only provisional at the moment and will probably also include Leonardo & del Sarto (E. Jones). As you cannot be present at least you shall know what I shall say.
      I shall go to bed soon: it is about 10.00 and I am tired after my SEA and V & A Day. Only four more nights and I shall see you again: only three more days; a moment less since I wrote your name at the head of this  letter, my love, my Sylvia.
      Tomorrow I have the Degas lecture and in the evening I must visit Pasmore's to talk over an essay with him, K. Martin, & J.Weekes (an architect). The other day I saw quite a lot of Mrs P, by the way, and she is charming, amiable, domestic. They have a boy of 11 and a girl a little younger (not 2 girls as I thought).
      Bed now. More tomorrow. I love you. Goodnight

As soon as I get to town I will enquire about the time of trains & tell you the one I shall probably catch on Friday morning: it is now only 2 full days and 3 nights until we meet.
