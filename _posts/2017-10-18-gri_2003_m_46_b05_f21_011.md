      4    which is probably a good thing as I am
      quite busy as you know--and I fear
      there may be a lot for feuds without
      run, Banger's from Hand!
      If the opportunity presents itself
      I should very much like to come up
      to town again before the 27th but I imagine
      that I shaln't really have time--it
      isn't very long, my love!
      I am writing this in the churchyard
      sitting on a convenient grave behind
      the church.  As I did not want
      to go home and come to the post again.
      I love you so much dear
      Lion--don't forget the constable Eltiele
      in the Burlington.  I adore you
      I love you
      Sylvia
