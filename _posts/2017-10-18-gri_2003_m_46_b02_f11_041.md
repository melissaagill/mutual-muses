      I do hope that you find there is not too much work to do at Pett and that you have a Christmas rather like the Mediterranean version mentioned in Taste.  That is my intention for I shall be leaving my mind and my balls at Blackheath.
      Paul and I last night saw Les Amants de Verone which, despite some unsatisfactory features, is, broadly, and affecting and beautiful film.  There are some charming shots of Venice, in particular one from S. Giorgio Maggiore, where we used to sit, read, and paint.  Death, as usual in French films, is the final stage of the story though more reluctantly than in Cocteau's films.  The young man is killed by the family of the girl he loves: "Where has it got hem', the girl asks.  "Where" and cuts her wrists to die with him.  At least death was not their aim.
      The editor of the A.I.A. newsletter ( which I hope to re-organize somewhat later) wants me to write about the French landscape exhibition.  No payment, but I will do, of course.
      My dove, my beauty, I adore you, and I long to fill all your stockings with gifts so I shall shower more poems on you very soon.  I love you so much, I never stop thinking about you, and you become more adorable every day.  Ravishing Minerva, I wish you a very nice Christmas and lots to eat.  I love you - do not overtire yourself - I love you,
