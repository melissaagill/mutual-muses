      THE DAY

      How am I to see you in the echoing stampedes
      Of loneliness that bruise the afternoons
      I cannot forget your body but I cannot touch
      It now as our hesitations combine
      Into a gigantic wedge

      Snow on the separating distances is repealed
      By Wednesday's and Friday's sun but oh
      The panic of those Sundays when desire will erupt
      Despite the bells and visits and I suddenly fall
      Into the nothing where you were

      THE NIGHT

      Tonight I am without you and I must torture sleep
      I have eaten the moon and am afraid of the dark
      The hyacinth I grew for you wilts for lack of you
      Dreams can't leave the filing cabinet tonight and stars
      Are dead as mythology

      Though nebulae hang like semen and comets never
      stop I want neither to sleep and dream about you nor
      Stay awake and think about you only want your body
      Rose-open beside me as the night spirals away
      Till morning comes with roses


      The still-life on the table
      holds skull and book
      but the lamp is hidden by an owl's wing
      there is only you

      Your mouth soft as a bruise that nest of flesh
      and the soft star
      which gives and needs no light
      there is nothing else
