      sidents in the walls of the mausoleum.  The hollow bang on the wood and his ventriloquist really had a slightly eerie effect, even though he was telling it as a joke.

      Afterwards I went to Chelsea Hospital and saw Grinling Gibbons' Charles II and the great painting by Verrio and Cook of Charles II in front of the hospital surrounded by allegorical figures.  It has just been cleaned.  You must certainly see both these and I hope also Saint Law-rence's church too someday soon.

      Your reference to your walk to the sea brings back a lot of memories to me also:  really Pett is becoming a kind of Atlantis or Eldorado to  me richly charged with vivid pleasures.  It was very fine and yet there was a hard wind from the sea on our day.  How different from the heavy scented day you describe.  How I look forward to seeing Pett again (Pett l[unclear]ev[/unclear]el, too) beyond your profile, or over your shoulder.  past your adorable hair.  What good news that the rushes are growing again - as you said they would.  Do you know the Princess Toutebelle?  She is a character from a fairy tale who was turned into a palm tree by the Yellow Dwarf on the day she was to marry the King of the Gold Mines.  I think I shall try and write something about her and put her into a Pett landscape.  If I do I think you might like to do some illustrations.  A blend of the pale rose and the owl with one-eye (standing for the two levels of reality, in the garden and in imagination) would be just what is needed.  What do you think?  Something like this would not require much effort and it would be fun.

        Here is an evening poem about Pett:  called, At The Rectory.

           Cool elongated phantoms fall
           Sideways across the lawn
           Plaintively recognising frailty
           And moaning the lack of physical love
           No bodies hot and rocking,
           Shunted and bruised by zephyrs these
           Phantoms falling vague away
           Unruled by Gravity
           Which gives such weight to lovers and their flesh

      And here is a poem which I have only just finished but which I started in Paris and continued in the train on my way back.

           Voices and footsteps from the street
           Echo in this one o'clock
           An owl sits on the Eiffel Tower
           Its wings caress the sleepy poet
