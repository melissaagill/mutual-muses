    clean_transcription: Pett<br/>29.7.51<br/>Dearest Lawrence,<br/>I was so disappointed
      not <br/>to hear your lecture, I do hope <br/>that you had a large intelligent<br/>audience.  I
      nearly managed it. We<br/>got to Charing Cross at 2:35!<br/>(we had six pieces
      of luggage and a<br/>folio!).  There was a train at 2:36! <br/>(which we caught!)
      and another <br/>at 3:35.  It was disappointing<br/>but as you will see very
      difficult.  <br/>I thougt of you vividly, my poet<br/>as I was carried away
      in the<br/>train.  The countryside looked lovely<br/>and I so much wished that
      you<br/>were with me - I miss you so <br/>much.  It was blazing yesterday -<br/>and
      lovely to be back in the sweet<br/>air of Pett again - we only just<br/>missed
      a bathe.  Clifford and
