      Dearest Sylvia
      I do hope that your journey yesterday was not too uncomfortable.

Busy as I was yesterday I felt buoyant and confident because of our happy time together which even the fact of departure could not eclipse.

I dreamed most sweetly of you last night - despite my Wimbledon bed. I hope you will be able to start painting soon, with your lion muse always thinking of you & thinking of you so lovingly, my sweetheart.
      This morning I bought a pair of shoes on brother's account as I hoped I would. In profile they are, roughly, thus: leather, not suede, and with a platform sole. They are light & comfortable. Father also gave me a quite pretty French shirt he is too fat to wear.
      My departure for Paris will be on Thursday morning at 9:35. Newhaven - Dieppe. I have only booked back to Newhaven so that I can take advantage of Michael's invitation to visit Pett again. I hope he still means it! I've had lunch with Peter & he promises the hold-all (the one we had in Italy) by Tuesday. I love you so much, by dearest beauty, Minerva and ravishing Muse.

      29 JUNE MCML
      Dearest Sylvia,
      I do hope that your journey yesterday was not too uncomfortable. Perhaps it may have been lightened by the thought of the happiness you gave me by those extra two days together & which I hope you shared. Busy as I was yesterday I felt buoyant and confident because of our happy time together which even the fact of departure could not eclipse. I took your picture in to the Leicester Galleries yesterday: if you took the AIA form let me have it back by Tuesday when I shall next be there. I dreamed most sweetly of you last night  - despite my Wimbledon bed. I hope you will be able to start panting soon, with your lion muse always thinking of you & thinking of you so lovingly, my sweetheart.
      This morning I bought a pair of shoes on Mother's account as I hoped I would. In profile they are, roughly, thus: leather, not suede, and with a platform sole. They are light and comfortable. Father also gave me a quite pretty French shirt he is too fat to wear.
      My departure for Paris will be on Thursday morning at 9.35. Newhaven-Dieppe. I have only booked back to Newlanen so that I can take advantage of Michael's invitation to visit Pett again. I hope he still  means it! I've had lunch with Peter & he promises the hold-all (the one I had in Italy) by Tuesday.
      I love you so much, my dearest beauty, Minerva, and ravishing Muse. Look after yourself (even if it means apparent selfishness). I adore you

      29 June MCML
      Dearest Sylvia
      I do hope that your jorney yesterday was not too un-
      comfortable.  Perhaps it may have been lightened by
      thought of the happiness you have me by these extra
      two days together which I hope you [unclear]shared[/unclear].  Busy as I
      was yesterday I felt buoyant and confident because
      of our happy time together which even the fact of depart-
      ure could not eclipse.  I took your picture in to a
      [unclear][/unclear][unclear][/unclear] yesterday.  If you took the A1A
      form let me have it back by Tuesday when I shall
      be next there.  I dreamed most sweetly of you last
      night, despite my [unclear]Wimbledon bed[/unclear].  I hope you will be
      able to start painting soon, with your lion muse al-
      ways thinking of you and thinking of you son longingly, my
      sweetheart.
      This morning I bought a pair of shoes on [unclear]brother's[/unclear]ac-
      cont as I hoped I would.  In profile they are, roughly,
      thus:  leather, not suede, and with a
      sole.  They are light and comfortable.
      [unclear][/unclear] also gave me a quite pretty French shirt he is too
      fat to wear.
      My departure for Paris will be on Thursday morning at
      9:35.  [unclear][/unclear][unclear][/unclear] I have only booked [unclear][/unclear] to
      [unclear][/unclear so that I can take advantage of [unclear][/unclear]
      invitation in [unclear][/unclear][unclear][/unclear] again.  I hope he still means it!
      I've had [unclear][/unclear][unclear][/unclear] Peter and he [unclear][/unclear] the old-all
      (the one we had in Italy) on Tuesday.
      I love you so much, my dearest beauty, Minerva,
      and ravishing muse.  Look after yourself (even if it
      means apparent selfishness).  I adore you
      Lawrence
