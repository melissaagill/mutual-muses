      Unloving once I know your step
      On the mosaic of nightmare
      Which heaved like a viscous flood
      Before you won imagination's war

      Now other desires I feel are clouds
      Not only wind-moved but also
      Disintegrating for their own
      Mysterious helpless reasons

      ii

      Over numerous roofs myriad
      Shadows cluster and the curved tiles
      Glisten like shiny loads of insects
      Whose crisp shells sharply refract the sun

      The room is a ruin of clothes
      And cooking smells and grey mirrors
      Giving only reluctantly my eye
      The body that is due

      The room secretes its dust
      As if it were an involute
      In which a mussel hides
      Fearing invading crowbars of light

      Dawn catches every wing of dust
      My movements flurry from the bed
      Just as it moulds the wings of smoke
      In the air at Saint-Lazare

      iii

      Voussoirs of ether shade the sky
      Into an azure arch
      A tiny cloud intrudes
      Like the beard of Mallarme

      Away from his haunt and ghost
      The train via orchards goes its whistle
      Echoed from distances
      Like a hunting horn of the past

      Mirrored perhaps in a sheep's eye
      I pass and never re-pass
      Loved just this once I lose my shape
      Like a tree full of birds' nests
