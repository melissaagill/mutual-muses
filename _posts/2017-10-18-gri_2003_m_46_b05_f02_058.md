      Blackheath
      29 ii 1952
      Dearest Sylvia
      I rang up Paul yesterday and invited him to spend the night at Blackheath. He accepted, arrived at 11.00 o'clock, and is here with me now as I write. He is delighted to hear that he may yet be able to exhibit with you if circumstances get better for him. Paul sends his love to you. (As I write a dove is cooing away outside - soft and strong notes) I am excited to hear your picture is, by now, almost finished & I anticipate seeing it with great pleasure. I am looking forward to Clifford's lecture very much. You will be able to hear it I am sure. Be careful with your gardening: do not overdo it and 'regard apres votre mains', says Hetty. (That's what she says.)
      I have an Arts Council lecture at Westcliff next Wednesday: Cubism at T.G. on Tuesday; Turner at T.G. tomorrow. Richard Convay by the way admired my R.B. & Del B review: apparently Smith is furious at my review & 'would like to get his hands on me', Dandy's first impulse was only to criticise small painters in future but Hetty said that I must not compromise. Lionel agreed.
      Yesterday I studied the Ital. Ren. galleries at the V & A discovering many charming objects, including a pavement from the Pal. Pandolfo Pettrucci where Pinturicchio's Return of Odysses comes from. Then I went to the R.A. again to study Turne & Constable.
      M has asked for my Francis Bacon literature which I am sending off to him today. He is writing an article.
      Iris wants a synopsis of an article on films for Brit. & En.
      Paul has just said again how pleased he is to hear that there is still a chance of his sharng the exhibition.
      I must get my Turner lecture ready. My usual choice of picture will not do because some of the rooms are closed & I must make up a complete new lecture.
      I love you dearest
      Lawrence

      Blackheath
      29 II 1952

      Dearest Sylvia

      I rang Paul yesterday evening and invited him to spend the night at Blackheath. He accepted, arrived at 11.00 o'clock, and is here with me now as I write. He is delighted to hear that he may yet be able to exhibit with you if circumstances get better for him. Paul sends his love to you. (As I write a dove is cooing away outside - soft and strong notes). I am excited to hear your picture is, by now, almost finished & I anticipate seeing it with great pleasure. I am looking forward to Clifford's lecture very much. You will be able to hear it I am sure. Be careful with your gardening: do not overdo it and 'regard apres votre mains' says Hetty. (That's what she says.)

      I have an Arts Council lecture at Westcliffe next Wednesday:[unclear]Culiggs[/unclear] at T.G on Tuesday; Turner at T.G. tomorrow. Richard [unclear]Convoy[/unclear] by the way admired my R.B. & Del B review: apparently Smith is furious at my review & 'would like to get his hands on me'. Dandy's first impulse was only to criticise small painters in future but Matty said that I must not compromise. Lionel agreed.

      Yesterday I studied the Ital. Ren. galleries at the V & A, discovering many charming objects, including a pavement from the Pal. Pandolfo Petrucci where Pinturicchio's Return of Odysseus comes from. The I went to the R.A again to study Turner & Constable.

      M has asked for my Francis Bacon literature which I am sending off to him today. He is writing an article.

      Iris wants a synopsis of an article on films for [unclear]Brit. & Ev[/unclear].

      Paul has just said again how pleased he is to hear that there is still a chance of his sharing the exhibition.

      I must get my Turner lecture ready. My usual choice of picture will not do because some of the rooms are closed & I must make up a complete new lecture.

      I love you dearest
      I love you
      Lawrence
