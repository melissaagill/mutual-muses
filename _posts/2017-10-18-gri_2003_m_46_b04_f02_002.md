      Blackheath 20 ii 1951 Dearest Sylvia,
      I hope your journey back was not too crowded:
      the bus passed me after I left you and it did seem
      fairly well occupied, I was sorry to see.

      I had a great wrestle at the V and A, almost
      everything I wanted being out: but by 5.00 I had
      got substitutes (including and American deceive-the-
      eye still life) and raced to Ted's. There I had
      the good fortune to find the enclosed coloured
      photgraphs of Ludwig's palaces. Tawdry as are
      the reproductions I think they give an idea of the
      magnificence of the originals.

      I saw The Dark Man: it was photographed, a good
      deal of it, in Hastings and Camber castle figured in
      the chase. The bench at Pett Level, with men work-
      ing on the seawall in the background, provided the
      best scene in the film. But I don't recommend it
      to you topographically. Kansas Raiders, the sup-
      porting film, was among the most homosexual Westerns
      I have seen since Red River. So the evening was not
      wasted: not entirely, I keep telling myself.

      Is it raining at Pett? It has just started here
      (11.00): soon I must get ready to leave for Tun-
      bridge Wells: I have prepared the lecture before
      writing this. Last time you were there: I wish
      you would be this time, my love.

      How excellent is your new double portrait. I
      do congratulate you. I know Paul will, too. I
      do love you, my dearest one: my mind and heart are
      full of you as I write. I love you, I treasure
      you.

      Black heath

      20 ii 1951

      Dearest Sylvia,

      I hope your journey back was not too crowded:
      the bus passed me after I left you and it did seem
      fairly well occupied, I was sorry to see.

      I had a great wrestle at the V and A, almost
      everything I wanted being out:  but by 5:00 I had
      got substitutes (including an American deceive-the-
      eye still life) and raced to Ted's.  There I had
      the good fortune to find the enclosed coloured
      photographs of Ludwig's palaces.  Tawdry as are
      the reproductions I think they give an idea of the
      magnificence of the originals.

      I saw The Dark Man:  it was photographed, a good
      deal of it, ini hastings and Camber castle figured in
      the chase.  The beach at Pett Level, with men work-
      ing on the seawall in the background, provided the
      best scene in the film.  But I don't recommend it
      to you topographically.  Kansas Raiders, the sup-
      porting film, was among the most homosexual Westerns
      I have seen since Red River.  So the evening was not
      wasted:  not entirely, I keep telling myself.

      Is it raining at Pett?  It has just started here
      (11:00):  soon I must get ready to leave for Tun-
      bridge Wells:  I have prepared the lecture before
      writing this.  Last time you were there:  I wish
      you would be this time, my love.

      How excellent is your new double portrait.  I
      do congratulate you.  I know Paul will, too.  I
      do love you, my dearest one:  my mind and heart are
      full of you as I write.  I love you, I treasure you.

      Lawrence
