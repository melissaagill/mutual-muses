      answer.  I will ring tomorrow morning, how-
      ever, and make him get on a move with the
      cards.  I will find out the addresses of the
      people you mentioned in this morning's letter
      Moynihan, SC.
           The TG is stripped - all-ready for a flood:
      any time after Friday it could happen appar-
      ently.  I was on the phone to Jane Ryder
      who told me this.  I certainly hope that the gallery es-
      capes.  At least nothing will be damaged
      this time.  I went to the Turner exh., by the
      way - yesterday - despite the weather and
      found much there to enjoy - especially some
      figure compositions.
           I am having supper with Parmore on
      Sunday next.

      TG is stripped - all-ready for a flood:<br/>any time after Friday it could happen
      appar-<br/>ently. I was on the phone to Jane Ryder<br/>who told me this. I certainly
      hope that the gallery es-<br/>capes. At least nothing will be damaged<br/>this
      time. I went to the Turner Exh., by the<br/>way - yesterday - despite the weather
      and<br/>found much there to enjoy - especially some<br/>figure composition.<br/>I
      am having supper with Passmore on<br/>Sunday next.
