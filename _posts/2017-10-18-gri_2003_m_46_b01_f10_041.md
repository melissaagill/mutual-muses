      19th November, 1948

      Dearest Sylvia,

      This must be a hasty note because I must be off in a
      few minutes to have tea with Charles and talk about my
      school lectures.  Perhaps I shall stun him, leave him
      in the Gentlemen's at the Vega and take his place for
      the weekend.  I know most of his cliches so the decep-
      tion might work.

      I hope dearest, that your cold is getting better.  I
      am quite concerned.  Look after yourself, dearest.  Did
      you catch it painting that ravishing view of the golden
      woods?  If so I am sure it was worth it.

      You remember the Cupids and so on over the mantle-
      pieces at Hampton Court?  Well I have adapted them into
      T. Stothard-like vignettes for you.

      A pink-bottomed putto
      Flying upsidedown
      Offers for your favour
      Mousse of poetry.
      2
      Putti support a palette
      Heavy with vivid dyes
      And naked connoisseurs on clouds
      Extoll your likenesses.
      3
      Putti in the kitchen
      Up-end a cornucopia
      Of oranges and pears
      Or pork and camembert.
      4
      Three plump putti flutter
      Around my naked love
      Guiding me to please her
      With lanterns, ribbands, bells.

      I wish I had more time but I have done the St Bartholomew
      Hogarth's this morning and now must fly.

      Sylvia, I love you.  I am your delighted captive.

      I love you
      Lawrence
