      etc.  from the green grocer's round
      the corner?
      I hope your lectures go well
      on Saturday.
      Be assured of my love, my dearest
      Lawrence.  I adore you, without
      you I feel I could not live.
      Please excuse a rather short
      letter as I shall go back and
      work in order to come to you
      the sooner.  I shall make every
      effort to come on Thursday--
      I do not think this will
      be difficult.  I will write
      again this evening.
      Don't forget to ask your father
      about the publishing trade!
      Look after yourself--my dearest
      creature--my poet, my Apollo.
      I love you
      Sylvia
      P.S.  If you need to see Miss Lacey
      on Saturday evening do not put
      her off.  S.  I love you.  Sylvia
