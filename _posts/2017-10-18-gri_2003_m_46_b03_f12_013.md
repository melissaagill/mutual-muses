      Dearest Lawrence,

      so nice to have it before starting this morning.
      We had a very pleasant drive - with
      a fair amount of sunshine, but it
      was far from warm. We stayed an
      hour at Chichester and looked over
      the cathedral. There are 3 Flaxman
      tombs - one very fine, the others pleasant,
      a wonderful C14th tomb of the Earl
      and Countess of Arundel.- his crest
      and helm being beautiful in intensity
      & texture and shape - the lion supportent
      at his feet - she has a dog - she crosses
      her legs, thus making an undulating
      movement towards him, he holds one
      gauntlet in a gauntleted hand
      and clasps hers with the other. He has
      a lion blazoned on his breast-plate. -
      She has a very beautiful gentle face.
      The other thing that particularly caught
      my imagination were the Saxon
      Base-releifs which were incorporated
