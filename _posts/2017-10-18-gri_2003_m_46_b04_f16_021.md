      Pett  26.4.51
      Dearest Lawrence,
      I have taken full advantage
      of the weather and taken lunch
      out--I shall go out again this
      afternoon it is only the dentist
      (2 write them from the waiting room)
      that prevents my being out this morn-
      ing.  I very much admire Dandy's
      picture.  I hope he is getting a nice
      even tan.  Poor cat is a bit puce
      through painting.  I don't think
      the blossoms will be out in time
      they will probably be over by
      the time I'm back alas.
      I have written and accepted
      Aunt Mararet's kind offer--as we
      shall be half-way to Bath it seems
      silly not to go.  I wonder if we
      can meet--probably not tactfully.
      I'm glad you have seen "Bicycle
      Shower" now you must see "Brighton
      Rock" and "Vivare in Pace"!
