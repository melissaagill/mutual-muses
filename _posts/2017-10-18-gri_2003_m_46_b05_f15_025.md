      His cold is a little better but going
      out lecturing irritates his throat at
      last night he was kept awake a
      good deal of the night coughing.
      We shall very much look forward
      to your lecture on films!  I hope you
      have a pleasant interview with Iris--yes
      do let me know the upshot.  I'm also
      glad that you have not forgotten Tiny's
      article!  I shall look forward to that
      very much.
      The question mark after Mr. Smith's state-
      ment makes it a bit equivoqal doesn't
      it?  I hope I shall come to a lecture
      soon.  I expect you are travelling home
      or to Wimbledon now--it is 10:30.
      I do hope you are not too warm--
      for you said that you had 3 lectures
      today.  My Lion is a lion, about town!
      I wonder if you have read "street car" yet?
      The Gilbert and Sullivan book sounds interes-
      ting.  I am reading George's China book
      again now.  It has been praised by C.
      Connoly--savage emphases the last
      syllable but one.
      I so much look forward to
      reading your new poem.

      His throat is a little better but going
      out [unclear]...[/unclear] irritates his throat and
      last night he was kept awake a
      good deal of the night coughing.
      We shall very much look forward
      to your lecture on films! I hope you
      do let me know the upshot. I'm also
      glad that you have not forgotten Tiny's
      article! I shall look forward to that
      very much.
      The question mark after Mrs. Smith's [unclear]state-
      ment[/unclear] makes it a bit equivocal doesn't
      it? I hope I shall come to a lecture
      soon - I expect you are travelling home
      or to Wimbledon now - it is 10.30.
      I do hope you are not too warm -
      for you said that you had 3 lectures
      to-day. My [unclear]...[/unclear] is a [unclear]lion[/unclear], about town!
      I wonder if you have read 'Street-car' yet?
      The [unclear]Gilbert[/unclear] and Sullivan book sounds interes-
      ting. I am reading [unclear]George's Chizi[/unclear] Book
      again now. It has been praised by C.
      Connoly - savage emphases [unclear]the[/unclear] last
      silable but one.
      I so much look forward to
      reading your new poem.
