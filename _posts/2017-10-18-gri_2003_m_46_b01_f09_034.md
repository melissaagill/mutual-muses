      I hope to hear from you shortly about the weekend arrangements. I ought to tell Lines not later than middle of next week whether I shall take the 5th or 12th. This house will be without its guardians from Friday 29th to the evening of the 31st, October.

      What I could not say on the phone but wanted to very much is that I love you so much and long for the news that you are able to see things calmly again. But do not let down your shield of indifference for a little while for your own sake. Do some painting and think about nothing. I feel like an uncle as much as a lover as I write those words but as a lover as I write these words but you know how I mean them. I love you, Sylvia.

      I love you. I shall write again this evening. All, my heart is yours,
