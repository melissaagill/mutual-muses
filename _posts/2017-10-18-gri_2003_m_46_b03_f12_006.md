    clean_transcription: 'Pett.                                                       Monday<br/><br/>Dearest
      Lawrence,<br/>               Thank you for your long and delightful letter,
      and for the drawing of Dandy at the fair. I do hope that you got my letter in
      time to warn you that I had already taken my paintings. I should have been more
      definite before.<br/>                The most vital thing I have to tell you
      at present is that the fete is on Saturday the 24th of June, but my pictures
      for exhibition are coming in on Wednesday and must be catalogued so that these
      can be printed in time so that I shall have to come back on Tuesday, (20th)
      evening, I suggested and Michael thinks it is a good idea that if you can, you
      should come back with me and stay until Monday morning June 26th. Then we hope
      the '
