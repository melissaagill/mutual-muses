      NG  26 VI-1951

      My dearest Sylvia,
      What a superbly loving [unclear][/unclear] you have to have left your ring
      for me.  How I love you.  Hetty joints ever time she puts your
      ring on her tiny finger.  Dandy has to keep catching her.
      Miss Oick offered me a lecture yesterday, at terribly short
      notice, of Golder's Green.  It is for Thursday.  I hesitated but
      on my name is not down for the ICA and it would pay me where-
      as the ICA would not I have accepted it.  So, alas, I cannot be
      in the Easton Road discussion after all--despite a great deal
      (or seemed a lot) of research on the subject.
      There will be plenty of others after all.
      I hope that the paintings are arriving in huge quantities.  I hope,
      too, that you are not doing more work than one can comfortably
      slaved.  I look forward to seeing the exhbition.
      Ichell did not come on Sunday:  Paul did.  As a result (on
      seeing Desire Caught by the Elm (or whatever it's called) this
      enemy with Madeline.  I rang her up and she said immediately,
      "Is Sylvia ocming?"  She wants you to come with me and have dinner
      with her as soonas you're back from the country.  You have
      made a conquest.  I said I would tell her as soon as you return to London
      I shall write our Venetian play soon.  I have completed a
      act of a surrealist play as yet untitled which I think is quite
      pleasing.  Also I have written another section of my film book
      called THE TRAGIC BLUFF, all about Hollywood:  evas-
      iveness of serious problems.
      I there may be out Wednesday or Thursday.
      I am in N.G. having just given a lecture:  among the ublic
      was the singer from the Players at the Ball.  I blinked at him
      madly and though he stayed for somet time he deserts just

      Paul sends his love and so, dearest do Yawalla, Hetty,
