      3. She has almost everything wrong with her. But  poor  [unclear] is more resigned to it now.
           When the light went I started  working out plans    for my model[/unclear]- and tried to fit the stairs in!- It all seems dreadfully complicated  mainly due to my infinitely subtle ruler which I have great difficulty in reading. I shall borrow Fing's!
            Desiree came for her lesson as usual- but was a bit aashamed of herself- she denies gossiping - but certainly, in their garbled form, the repeated things have a strange relationship with what I said! However- adolescence is a difficult time-  I must be more carefull in future. The poor child is living under a great strain.
            I'm so sorry to bother you but may I remind you that the Keneyton[/unclear] starts on the 18th Dec. I will send you the form when it comes and should be so grateful

      she has almost everything wrong with her.  But poor [unclear]Tiny[/unclear] is more resigned to it now.

      When the light went I started working out plans for my model - and tried to fit the stairs in!  In all seems dreadfully complicated mainly due to my infinitely subtle ruler which I have great difficulty in reading.  I shall borrow [unclear]Tiny's[/unclear]!

      Desiree came for her lesson as usual - but was a bit ashamed of herself.  She denies gossiping - but certainly[unclear] in[/unclear] there garbled form, the repeated things have a strange relationship with what I said!  However - adolescence is a difficult time.  I must be more careful[unclear] to[/unclear] future.  The poor child is living under a great strain.

      I'm so sorry to bother you but may I remind you that the Kensington shuts on the 18th Dec.  I will send you the form when it comes and should be so grateful
