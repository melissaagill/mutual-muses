      My dearest Sylvia
      Your letter came this morning. Thank you for it, dearest love. I love you so much. As you seem to have guessed I would I looked at your pictures last night with [unclear] rare [/unclear] pleasure. I will extend the catalogue  entry a little: No 21 - self portrait as Minerva, with white [unclear] owl[/unclear]; No 22 - the "Rococo" lady Hetty! But, still, I anticipate too far ahead perhaps. I hope two more Pett landscapes will be added shortly.
      I have been writing at the Tate inspired by your letter to work especially  well. How thought -
      ful you are - mention of any glimpse  of marriage a la mode brightened my senses thus morning and certainly enabled me to work better. I feel a bit exhausted but it is [unclear]horrible [/unclear]labour and so feel slightly complacent.
      I think of you all the time.
      Thanks to your list of names I have been spurred  to action. Gainsborough & I are now on the very best of terms. (Incidentally  I  met B.

      At the Tate Gallery
      24 VIII 1949

      My dearest Sylvia,

      Your letter came this morning. Thank you for it, dearest love. I love you so much. As you seem to have guessed I [unclear]waned[/unclear]. I looked at your picture last night with rare pleasure. I will extend the catalogue entry a little: No. 21 - Self portrait as Minerva, with white [unclear]Owl[/unclear]' No. 22 - The "Rococo" lady Hetty! But, still, I anticipate too far ahead, perhaps. I hope two more Pett landscapes will be added shortly.

      I have been writing at the late [unclear]evrpinel[/unclear] by your letter to work especially well. How thoughtful you are - mention of our glimpse of marriage a la mode brightened my senses this morning and certainly enabled me to work better. I feel a bit exhausted but it is honorable labour and so feel slightly complacent.

      I think of you all the time.

      Thanks for your list of name I have been spurred into action. Gainsborough & I are now on the very best of terms. (Incidentally I met B.
