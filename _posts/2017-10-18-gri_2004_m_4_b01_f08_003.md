      My dear Marjorie,
      I am so sorry that my visit
      has left a legacy of ruin:  my
      cold going first to you and now
      to Sylvia.  I am afraid this
      must add to your many duties.
      However, this aside, I did
      enjoy my visit so much:  from
      semantics to dinner.
      It was so kind of you to send
      me home with your delicious home-
      made bread, and butter and meat.
      I was very glad of them when I
      reached home late on Friday.  I
      made the loaf last through the
      weekend.  Thank you again for it.
      You never seem to come to town
      now.  You must bring Clifford to
      Blackheath again before long as
      Hetty would love to entertain you.
      Love to you both.
      Laurence

      My dear Majorie,

      I am so sorry that my visit has left a legacy of ruin: my cold going first to you and now to Sylvia. I am afraid this must add to your many duties.

      However, this aside, I did enjoy my visit so much: from semantics to dinner.

      It was so kind of you to send me home with your delicious homemade bread, and butter and meat. I was very glad of them when I reached home late on Friday. I made the loaf last through the weekend. Thank you again for it.

      You never seem to come to town now. You must bring Clifford to Blackheath again before long as Hetty would love to entertain you.

      Love to you both

      Lawrence
