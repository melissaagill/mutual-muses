      THE MASQUE OF WATER      SIX
      Cesare Ripa, carried by Saturn enters, and addresses himself Sylvia :
      My role is a modest one : that of foot-note. It falls to me to confirm what you already suspect. The symbols, though chosen with modern liberality, support a single plan. The river by which your gifts were conveyed is  that which between Blackheath and Pett - and with which you are personally familiar. But water is not only a means of transport, it is an emblem of love and art, as it leaps like Hippocrene and runs into the sea which it might be said to fertilise. (I admit the conceit.) The river carries your Birthday Masque and is, also , a metaphor of reconciliation, as between male and female. The transition to another, lighter element is meant to symbolise erotic sensations and, at the same time, bring us back, in a circle, to the river again for Hippocrene, though it arises in the earth, is nourished by the beneficience of cloud-carried Goddesses, such as yourself. And now you will mount the cloud.

      Dance of the Water-Nymphs and Sylphs, Sylphs and Water-Nymphs.

      They sing :
      The blonde sky of Tiepolo
      Nurses your balcony of cloud.
      Below you, see the river
      By which your lion returns,
      Past the sea-shell sounds,
      Through the bridges of the day.

      You shall race your lion home,
      Conveyed by air leave him behind
      And as he nears the inland source
      Shall find the rising current stronger,
      And wonder at the power
      Until he realises

      Sylvia adds to Hippocrene
      As Cesare Ripa had forseen.

      The Masque of Water closes with a Triumphant Dance led by Sylvia and the Lion : first on the vessel on the water, second on the cloud which is gilded by Phoebus Apollo.
