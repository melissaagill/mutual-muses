      Would you mind if I come on Friday instead of Thursday?  In my eagerness to see you I forgot that I have an appointment at [unclear]Modders[/unclear] to talk about 'Production' and actually sign the contract.  Friday, then?  I suggest that you try and do some packing by Friday so that I can take some back with me.  It would diminish your load a little.

      We agreed that you would leave Michael BEFORE we went to Italy and not when you come back.  Please do not try and change this.  My second Epithalamium, at least, ought to be on time and appropriate.  I love you so much.

      Dearest Sylvia, be firm.  I love you I love you much - Lawrence

      Would you mind if I come on Friday instead of Thursday?  In my eagerness to see you I forgot that I have an appointment at Maddens to talk about 'Production' and actually sign the contract.  Friday, then?  I suggest that you try and do some packing by Friday so that I can take some back with me.  It would diminish your load a little.

      We agreed that you would leave Michael BEFORE we went to Italy and not when you come back.  Please do not try and change this.  My second Epithalamium, at least, aught to be on time and appropriate.  I love you so much.

      Dearest Sylvia, be firm.  I love you.

      I love you so much.

      Thursday?  In my eagerness to see you I forgot that I have an appointment at
      Maddens to talk about 'Production' and actually sign the contract.  Friday,
