      muse and subject [unclear]exaltes[/unclear].  There is part of a poem - not quite complete - which was suggested when I woke up first before you in the morning.

      No mirror no music no new hats
      made from a hand of feathers
      no wind disturbing the hair of your head
      the smile and the tears do not exist

      mirrors have no name for repose
      music is silence looking for a name
      your hair is perfect as it is
      [unclear]twined[/unclear] on the pillow [unclear]of[/unclear] your shoulders

      The one perched on the stars, the comet
      like a run in a woman's stocking.
      [unclear]one[/unclear]
      one cancelled by your senses sleeping

      Until your eyes your lips your ears wake
      I am lost in the world you have lost

      Yesterday [unclear]Johnson[/unclear] and I went to the Indian exhibition: you can imagine the memories this caused - [unclear]quite[/unclear], inescapable at eye-level.  We had tea with Vanstone and his wife,by the way:  Mrs Vanstone is probably coming to your lecture on Wednesday, I am looking forward to this very much:  sorry not to have been helpful at the [unclear]N. G.[/unclear] Friday but my id wouldn't let me spare any attention from you.  Formal problems were right out of reach.  I'll be more alert intellectually on Wednesday. (O the hell until Sunday, Monday and Tuesday!)
