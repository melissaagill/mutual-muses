      Claring Cross Station     Tuesday
      Dearest Sylvia
         Thank you for your letters.   I am sure it is your new pen which enables you to write so well & so often & make your lion so happy.   Oh dearest - how I adore you.

      I expect you got my wire in which I said I would meet the train at Eastbourne at 2-36 which leaves Hastings at 2-5.   It arrives at Victoria at 4-4 so you will have plenty of time to see the Leicester Gallery. 2 or 3 [unclear]loades[/unclear] from engine - non-[unclear]swaher[/unclear], of course.   Your lion will probably wear his pullover giallo.

      We will get Rome & Venice addresses in Florence.   Can give you nothing till then.
