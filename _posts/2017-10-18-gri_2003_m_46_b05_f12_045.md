      My dearest Sylvia
      Here is my first letter to you on my new note-paper printed by Ricky. I think it is rather handsome, don't you?
      The short happy life of a film critic. I shall be seeing my films in the evenings again with the masses not in the mornings. Just call me John Q. Public. Playbill is stopping publication, after all.
      I had another Christmas present from a lecturee. A voluptuous and handmade box of chocolates. Steeling myself I have resolved to give it to Mother who is now off her sugar diet.
      It is 10.00 and I am exhausted. The Christmas tree is decorated and so is the entire drawing room and mistletoe is secreted about the place. All my least useful muscles have been brought into what can only be described as play.
      It looks as though I am here until Monday as there are parties on Satur-
