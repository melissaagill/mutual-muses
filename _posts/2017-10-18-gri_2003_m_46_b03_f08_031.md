      Polydor (iv)

      Innocent poet on the mat marked Welcome.
      Since he read the capitals he lounges
      Never re-reading the letters upside down
      Or puzzling minatory anagrams.

      Travelled poet with a map of the trade root
      Between the leaf and the underground stream,
      Between Venice and the rusty branch line,
      Do you know the way to an empty door?

      When are you going to dress, pot of flesh?
      When are you going to sleep, poet of night?
      The poet of night and the poet of flesh
      Are one and the same at a crimson door.

      The twenty-fourth door is unoccupied:
      Perfume and smells of cooking alternate.
      Breathless at the fingerprints on the plate
      I wonder whose they are: I think I'll wait.
