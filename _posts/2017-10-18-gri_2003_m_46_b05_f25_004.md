      [1952?]
      My dearest Sylvia -
      "The Childhood of the Poet" is only a provisional title: another idea was "Master, I bat on". It is as illusive in christen as "Hogarth". No, "Hogarth a re-assessment" won't do= it is a descriptive subtitle, not a title in itself (&there are too may books just called Hogarth.)- The other poem is one I mentioned - the poet attacked by ob-jects and then reconciled to them = again the title is not final. Once the nature of the murders in "The Childhood" is realised they are, I hope you will find, less alarming. I have written some more of "Hogarth's Friends", am prepar-ing next week's N. G. lectures, and feel like writing some more poems. I have re-arranged the hanging of your pictures, and they give me new pleasure.
                   I love you
                    Lawrence

      My dearest Sylvia-

         "The childhood of the Poet" is on;y a
      provisional title  = another idea was
      "Master, I bat on".  It is as illusive
      to  christen as "Hogarth",  No, "Hogarth
      a re-assessment" won't do =  it is a des-
      criptive subtitle, not a title in itself
      (& there are too many books just called
      Hogarth).   The other poem is one I
      mentioned -- the poet attacked by  ob-
      jects and then reconciled to them = again
      the title is not final.  Once the nature
      of the murders in "The Childhood" is
      realised they are, I hope you will find,
      less alarming.  I have written some
      more of "Hogarth's Friends", am prepar
      ing next week's N.G. lectures, and
      feel like writing some more poems.
      I have re-arranged the hanging  of
      your  pictures, and they give me new
      pleasure.

             I love you
              Lawrence
