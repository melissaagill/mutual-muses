      Ward settlement: I have to go to the V&A and finish my lists of slides and prepare
      something for Banstead. My Sex notes and article won''t be finished until tomorrow
      morning...I have a TG lecture in the afternoon tomorrow (Rovey) as well as Sex.
      (and some S.E.A. bits and pieces.)<br/><br/>Nice evening at Pasmore''s last
      night. A publication (by Tiranti) is projected: Suggested title: "Art In Space:
      constructivust developments today" (I should be a contributor).<br/><br/>Well
      I must return to the grindstone (a very quickly moving grindstone today and
      tomorrow). And then we shall meet at last.<br/><br/>love you<br/>Lawrence.'
