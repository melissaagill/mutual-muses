      Pett, 27.7.52
      Dearest Lawrence,
      I do miss you and your sunny presence. My darling [unclear]Lion[/unclear]. I have so much enjoyed your lectures and learned so much, as well as painted well. I hope to go painting tomorrow morning either on the shore or near the Baidens. I hope I shaln't draw too much attention to myself!
      I arrived home safely and caught the bus with ease. Hastings is very crowded. I read a few articles in the Listener - including Povesners or Bolsover. I read it as little as possible - only culling the information.  How insensitive can you get. He who admires Butterfield and others of like calibre poses contempt on 17th provincial carving and architecture.
      You wil be pleased to hear that
