      this evening - for that [unclear]dinner[/unclear]. Mrs M said (on the phone)
      how they both wished you were coming & that you
      must dine there soon. That has been Lion's life since you left.
      Busy, but with much time to miss you.

      Thank you, too, for nursing me. If you hadn't looked
      after me at the weekend I should not have been
      able to work (& earn) these past two days.

      I am looking forward more than I can tell
      you to our setting up house together. I can't
      wait. Trust me again darling. Try. I
      love you, I love you, love you
      Lawrence
