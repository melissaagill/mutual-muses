      dearest Sylvia: \n\nHow strange and how delightful that our letters, both written
      on the 25th at 11 o'clock, should pass in the post. I am so glad that you are
      happy apart from and because of me, as you say only in better English in your
      letter, and in very large measure I agree with you. I shall try and put this
      paradox into verse. I think it is desireable to come to terms with the situation
      as you have done - though it is not easy for me, as I am not assisted by my
      background. But what you say is true - it is true for me: after all I do not
      bite my nails as soon as we separate and we both have each other's love even
      separated. I cannot say how much this means to me; but you know, darling. \n\nMy
      sylvia is not the marmalade cat though your industry is not entirely feline.
      I feel that right back in your cat-ancestry there is a slight impurity - possibly
      of human stock? I suggest this very tentatively but the vast quantity of marmalade
      does speak for itself. I'm looking forward to tasting in: as you Dandylions
      are not averse to it at Breakfast. \n\nAgain you quote Clifford as saying we
      are lucky to see each other only occasionally. But how would he like to have
      half a rectory, half Leon Bloy's Works, a spoonful of brandy and not a cellar
      full. How would you rather have Holkham or a bungalow. How splendid, following
      Clifford's reasoning, if only Gothic England were to be published by Penguin
      Books. Of course fewer illustrations and the appendices are omitted but it fits
      the pocket so well. Batsford would soon be bankrupt. Holkham be partitioned
      for two hundred families from the Gorbel, and so on. And with a digest you save
      time and don't get all that distressing sense of living with an author which
      occurs if you read is book In the Original. Sylvia I love you and the rest of
      my life would not be too long. \n\nI leave you to decide when I am to Come.
      Would it be worth waiting till you know if you will be well on what date before
      finally deciding. But, no. I want to see you soon. And then you are going to
      Italy. No, you tell me when you think and I'll book on the coach for that day.
      15th, 17th, any of these, any other, fits me perfectly well. \n"

      My dearest Sylvia:

          How strange and how delightful that our letters, both written on the 25th at 11 o'clock, should pass in the post.  I am so glad that you are happy a-part from and because of me, as you say only in better English in your letter, and in very large measure I agree with you.  I shall try and put this para-dox into verse.  I think it is desireable to come to terms with the situation as you have done - though it is not easy for me, as I am not assisted by my back-ground.  But what you say is true - it is true for me:  after all I do not bite my nails as soon as we separate and we both have each other's love even sep-arated.  I cannot say how much this means to me; but you know, darling.

          My Sylvia is now the marmalade cat though your in-dustry is not entirely feline.  I feel that right back in your cat-ancestry there is a slight impurity - possibly of human stock?  I suggest this very tenta-tively but the vast quantity of marmalade does speak for itself.  I'm looking forward to tasting in:  as you Dandylions are not averse to it at Breakfast.

          Again you quote Clifford as saying we are lucky to see each other only occasionally.  But how would he like to have half a Rectory, half Leon Bloy's works, a spoonful of brandy and not a cellar full.  Would you rather have Holkham or a bungalow.

Of course fewer illustrations and the appendices are omitted but it fits the pocket so well.  Batsford would soon be bankrupt.

And with a Digest you save time and don't get that distressing sense of living with an author which occurs if you read his book IN THE ORIGINAL.  Sylvia I love you and the rest of my life would not be too long.

          I leave you to decide when I am to come.  Would it be worth waiting till you know if you will be well on what date before finally deciding.  But, no.  I want to see you soon.  And then you are going to Italy.  No, you tell me when you think and I'll book on the coach for that day.  15th, 17th, any of these, any other, fits me perfectly well.
