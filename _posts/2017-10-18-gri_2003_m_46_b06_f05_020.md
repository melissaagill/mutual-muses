      Blackheath 19.5.53
      Tuesday

      Dearest Sylvia:

      I am glad that my poems are still [unclear]'sirenish'[/unclear] after all, though fatal still fetching.

      Somebody ought to [unclear][/unclear] Brunskill: I love your characterisation of him, his super-ego latching on to the corners of pictures. Wonderful.

      The character of Brunskill which you make so vivid reminds me that I wish I had your way of catching people, because I have an idea for a story. 2 girls, one engaged to an absent man, the other neurotically inhibited, both reject lovers: the 2 girls grow together, though starting from different points. The men are identically frustrated and become interchangeable. (The main point is the change from 'saving herself for one man' to neurotic purity in the heroine.)

      I saw Paul H last night. The first time for ages. He has an office job (until Hume's film goes into production).  He took me to 'High Spirits' - the revue with Diana Churchill and Cyril Ritchard. It was very amusing but many good ideas did not quite clicke e.g.  A popular song by Henry James and a song by Lord Leighton's and Alan [unclear]Tadena's[/unclear] favorite model (I'm sick to death of the glory that was Greece" and "Thanks- I'll sit this orgy out."). There was a divine [unclear][/unclear] musical comedy of 1918- 'The Shopgirl Princess' which was bliss. Very good, also, was a number called 'A Laugh, A Song, and a Lexicon' in which a Vaudeville pair (like the Fit-as-a-Fiddle number in 'Singin' In The Rain') named BOSWELL & JOHNSON do their act. One song was "Maybe it's because I'm a Lexicon, that I love language so?' (Don't tell Clifford...)

      I met Eduardo Poalozzi yesterday and got on quite well with him. It's amazing what a little article will do- as a 30ish song nearly said.

      Except for working hard (ballet, lectures, an article) I have no news. I am absolutely broke- but that need not worry you for somehow I eat regularly. It is a kind of juggling act. As soon as I have some money I want you here but at the very present moment it is difficult.

      The blue tits have definitely made a nest in the [unclear][/unclear] outside the window. Christ- but they are busy- in and out all the time.

      my poems are still 'sirenish' after all, tho' fatal still fetching. Somebody
      ought to scale Brunskill: I love your characterisation of him, his super-ego
      latching on to the corners of pictures. Wonderful. The character of Brunskill
      which you make so vivid reminds me that I wish I had your way of catching people,
      because I have an idea for a story. 2 girls, one engaged to an absent man, the
      other [unclear]neurotically[/unclear] inhib-ited, both reject lovers: the 2
      girls grow together, tho' starting from dif- ferent points. The men are identically
      frustrated & become inter chang- eable. (The main point is the change from 'saving
      herself for one man' to neurotic purity in the heroine.) \nI saw Paul H last
      night. The first time for ages. He has an office job (until Hume's film goes
      into production). He took me to High Spirits. the venue with Diana Churchill
      & Cyril Ritchard. It was very amus-ing but too many good ideas did not quite
      click - e.g. A popular song of Henry James and a song of Lord Leighton's & [unclear]Alina[/unclear]
      Tadena's favorite model ('I'm sick to death of the glory that was Greece' and
      \"Thanks - I'll sit this orgy out'.) There was a divine '[unclear]potted[/unclear]'
      musical comedy of 1918 - The Shopgirl Princess which was bliss. Very good, also,
      was a number called 'A Laugh,, A Song, & a Lexicon' in which a Vaudeville pair
      (like the Fit-as-a-Fiddle number in Singin' In The Rain) named BOSWELL & JOHNSON
      do their act. One song was: 'Maybe it's because I'm a Lexiconer, that I love
      language so.' (Don't tell, Clifford...)\nI met Eduardo Paolozzi yesterday and
      on quite well with him. It's amazing what a little article will do - as a 30ish
      song nearly said.\nExcept for working hard (ballet, lectures, an article) I
      have no news. I am absolutely broke - but that need not worry you for somehow
      I eat regularly. It is a kind of juggling act. As soon as I have some money
      I want you here but at the very present moment it is difficult.\nThe blue tits
      have definitely made a nest - the work outside the window. Christ - but they
      are busy - in & out all the time. I love you love you love you Lawrence"
