      Dearest Lawrence

      Herewith a small but I think rather charming book which Clifford gave to me and I said I should give to you, to which he agreed. It is to wish you many happy returns of the day - of Sunday. My love I shall soon to with you to greet you in person. I shall send a letter and a water-colour later I hope, but in case parcels take longer I send this with my love.
