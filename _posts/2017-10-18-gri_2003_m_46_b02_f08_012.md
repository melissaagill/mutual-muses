      Trained to blind the beast of war
      Even as its ring reflect
      Lovers in their summer attitudes.

      I have an old Burlington Magazine with an article by Richter about a Moses picture which may be useful to you since it seems to be by Giorgione.

      You might be amused to read my review of The Rainbow from Time and Tide. Did you read The Listener review? One of us must be wrong I think and I know whose side I am on.

      Francis came in to clean the room the other day and for some reason known only to her moronic self untied the tapes on the bed cover. I have been able to recover only one string so far. Can you tell me how to get them out?

      The transplanted shoot is not doing very well I'm afraid but the others are in a fine state, taller, stronger more colourful than when you saw them last.

      I must go and shop for I am having all my meals in today and the larder is bare.

      I love you, Sylvia, my dove, my rose, adore you and long to see you,

      I love you Lawrence
