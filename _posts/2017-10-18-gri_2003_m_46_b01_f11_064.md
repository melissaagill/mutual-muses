      of G.  We decided it might be useful for Minerva to have a comprehensive collection of illustrations like that.

      Dr. Antal was nice and gave me a long article about Mannerism which you will be interested in I think.

      I hope you have had a good Christmas.  It is really only good food that has provided my pleasure this year, though thought of you has kept me going.  Oh you are never out of my thoughts and I love you.

      I wrote this poem - FROST - for you this morning at about two o'clock when I at last managed to escape to bed:

      Crystalline scars,
      Frail spikes of cacti,
      Flowers of torture,
      Splinters of sleep,
      Compose a style -
      Sadistic, cold -
      An iconography of ice
      Superimposed upon
      The landscape of desire -
      White symbols of that fear,
      Fostered by absence,
      Which seems to make of winer
      A locked-up world, but melts
      At summer in our breath.

      I love you, dearest Sylvia,
      I love you, Lawrence
