      2 and everything is coming out in bloom. Too quickly, or rather leaf. Also I would like to get on with the background of Cliffords picture. Yesterday I finished a plate design of V. Leigh and L. Oliver as *Anthony and Cleopatra I think you will like it - I will do some floral ones this afternoon perhaps also I am going to size some canvases ready for next time its fine. I dug a trench this morning in the rain- ready for manuring for lettuce and tomatoes - and I have been raking the grass that Owens cut on Saturday in the orchard. I do a little every day - its quite hard work.
      I shall try to borrow photographs of the "Amulate" and only buy two. I think probably some people would pose - but I'd rather they didn't! I don't think Tiny would like to have them in the Rectory - if necessary
