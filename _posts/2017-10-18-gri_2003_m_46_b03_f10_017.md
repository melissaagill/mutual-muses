      Dearest Sylvia
      Now that I am in the train to leave [unclear]Clarton[/unclear] I feel in a more amiable frame of mind than when I wrote the last letter an hour or so ago.
      Last night I had a long conversation (no, it was not a conversa-tion if, as Proust says, conversation is a department of [unclear]lthe[/unclear] in-telligence) with my landlady [unclear]or[/unclear] a fellow-guest, an almost bald lady who teaches elocution. We discussed aeroplane-crashes: 'I'd as soon get in one of those airplanes as' - she sought for the right word, 'fly'. When our laughter at her half-deliber-ate, half-spontaneous jest died down, she produced two Austrian works of art, medieval castles (one of which had inspired Walt Disney's background for Snowwhite, I was in-formed), burned on wood with an electrical needle. My admiration was moderate. She next produced a musical box which tinkled 'Roll out the barrel' as its walls, painted with [unclear]flames[/unclear] & ivory castles opened & shut compul-sively. She only played it rarely as no English craftsman could be found to repair such delicate work, once it went wrong. The elocution teacher rolled ecstatically in the sofa, she is 50 at least, & said - 'ah, it's so beautiful the way its doors open & shut'. Then we discussed the outrageous taxation on musical boxes. 2 duty, it was. From which it was but a small step to what we had read in the Daily Telegraph.
      I learned, which amused me, that the [unclear]press[/unclear] is owned privately [unclear]by[/unclear] an 80 year-old lady who is very particular - dresses the [unclear]friends[/unclear] 'ex-quis-it-ly' & allows no 'dirty' jokes. She in-

    annotation_text: "14 XI 50\nDearest Sylvia\nNow that I am in the train to leave
      Clacton I feel in a more amiable frame of mind than when I wrote the last letter
      an hour or so ago. \nLast night I had a long conversation (no, it was not a
      conversa-tion if, as Proust says, conversation is a department of the in-telligence)
      with my landlady & a fellow-guest, an almost bald lady who teaches elocution.
      We discussed aeroplane-crashes: 'I'd as soon get in one of those airplanes as'
      - she sought for the right word, 'fly'. When our laughter at her half-deliber-ate,
      half-spontaneous jest died down, she produced two Austrian works of arts, medieval
      castles (one of which had inspired Walt Disney's background for Snowwhite, I
      was informed), burned on wood with an electrical needle. My admiration was moderate.
      She next produced a musical box which tinkled 'Roll out the barrel' as its walls,
      painted with flowers & ivory castles opened & shut compul-sively. She only played
      it rarely as no English craftsman could be found to repair such delicate work,
      once it went wrong. The elocution teacher rolled ecstatically in the sofa, she
      is 50 at least, & said - 'Oh, it's so beautiful the way's its doors open & shut'.
      Then we discussed the outrageous taxation on musical boxes. 2 pound duty, it
      was. From which it was but a small step to what we had read in the Daily Telegraph.\nI
      learned, which amused me, that the pier is owned privately by an 80 year 'old
      lady who is very particular - dresses the [unclear]pierrots[/unclear] 'ex-quiz-it-ly'
