      Rectory Lodge  31-7-52

      Dearest Lawrence
      I enclose cuttings of the Straffen
      Case which interested you, and the
      Birmingham advertisement.  It doesn't
      seem to say anything about the
      25gh of August.  I'd send in straight
      away.
      I do hope you feel cheerful although
      you miss me as I miss you, but
      if I feel secure in your
      love I do not feel so sad when we
      are apart.  Tiny has cleared up
      again now--making an effort for
      Majj.  I think she and Clifford had
      a gloom on about money, and
      certainly they are going to have
      a struggle next year as it appears
      that they will be about 100 down!
