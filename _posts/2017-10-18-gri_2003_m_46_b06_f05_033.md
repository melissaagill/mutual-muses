      Though the hills and fountains of ancient Rome
      Used to be my spiritual home,
      The hell with St. Peter's fabulous dome.
      I only want to be one place with you.

      (Fade in to the palace where the people have just finished
      complaining to the King.)

      KING: We can searcely believe our ears
      At these un-Nosdarian fears.
      If your parents had acted this way
      Where would we be today?
      Do you know?

      ALL (uneasily): Well, no.

      KING (speaking): When you jibe at the just tax
      You stab ourself in the back.

      (The King steps up to a microphone: glances at his notes.)

      You must all lend a hand to the Motherland,
      To the land that has given you all.
      This Utopia of a land,
      This cornucopia of a land.
      Must never go to the wall.

      AGITATOR: I hate to see that Motherland go down.

      (The King frowns and watches him suspiciously at intervals
      during the second chorus.)

      She is great, she is grand, our dear Motherland.
      You must try to live up to the Crown.
      This Utopia of a land,
      This cornucopia of a land,
      Don't let the Motherland down.

      There are issues you just can't ignore.
      Who's gonna pay for the 100 years war?
      Us?

      four
       Though the hills and fountains of ancient Rome
       Used to be my spiritual home,
       The hell with St Peter's fabulous dome.
       I only want to be one place with you.

      (Fade in to the palace where the people have just finished
      complaining to the King.)

      KING: We can scarcely believe our ears
               At these un-Nosdarian fears.
               If your parents had acted this way
               Where would we be today?
               Do you know?

      ALL (uneasily): Well, no.
      KING (speaking): When you jibe at the just tax
                       You stab ourself in the back.

      (The King steps up to a microphone: glances at his notes.)
        You must all lend a hand to the Motherland,
        To the land that has given you all.
        This Utopia of a land,
        This cornucopia of a land,
        Must never go to the wall.

      AGITATOR: I hate to see that Motherland go down.

      (The King frowns and watches him suspiciously at intervals
      during the second chorus.)
        She is great, she is grand, our dear Motherland.
        You must try to live up to the Crown.
        This Utopia of a land,
        This cornucopia of a land,
        Don't let the Motherland down.

         There are issues you just can't ignore.
         Who's gonna pay for the 100 years war?
         Us?

      ALL: No!
