      107 Blackheath Park,
      London, S.E.3

      29 XII 1949
      Dearest Sylvia,
      The pantomime, yesterday, was rather dull, despite my interest in folk-lore: and the cat was a great disappointment, quite without charm or grace - I was most offended.
      Tonight is mercifully the last party and tomorrow I return to Blackheath to rest and to retrieve my libido. I look forward very much to this for - although I have finished The Figureheads - I have no peace whatever here.
      The strain of Christmas on the people here is showing: it is 12:45 and Deirdre is still in bed, [unclear][/unclear]Fatler[unclear][/unclear] is home from the office with a cold, Fred Stephenson has toothache, Sheila an upset stomach, Connie continual indigestion, Walter and Tommy what they call[unclear][/unclear] "splitting"[unclear][/unclear]
