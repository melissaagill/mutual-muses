      Blackheath                                   27 viii 1949

      Dearest Sylvia,

          Bearing in mind your warning I tried to be mod-
      erate in my hopes but the poet has again this
      morning brought a letter from you.   It makes me
      very happy and helps me so very much to work.   I
      have a tendeny to be restless which your letters
      smooth.

          I was with John so long yesterday I was unable
      to do Gilpin so I must to town today for him.
      While I am there I must go to the Tate and review
      the new acquisitions for Gainsborough.   But I
      will definitely finish M a la Mode on Sunday - be
      sure, I shall.

           What a pity that the chairs are unsatisfactory.
      Did you look at the mirror and small table in the
      other shop?

           Do congratulate Clifford on his appointment.   I
      think it is a marvellous step forward and upward.

           Here is the finished poem about our VENUS:

                The music and the volition of birds
                Spanning the sea like bridges of flesh -
                The three-dimensional arabesques
                Of putti antic lovers, serving
                Venus with the attributes
                Of arrow, torch, and apple:
                Alert, profane, like adjectives they spin
                Around the rose-hub of the flesh.
                Challenging gravity like verbs
                Ephebi of the quim perform
                In the gulf-stream of the sun,
                Dance to the orchestra of clouds
                And the orgasms of the waves
                Above deserted Neptune's dented crown.

      I shall write again immediatel              I love you

                                                                            Lawrence

      What a pity that the chairs are unsatisfactory! Did you look at the mirror and small table in the other shop?

      Do congratulate Clifford on his appointment.  I think it is a marvellous step forward and upward.

      mind your warning I tried to be moderate in my hopes but the post has again

      so very much to work.  I have a tendency to be restless which your letters smooth.\n\nI
      was with john so long yesterday I was unable to do gilpin so I must to town
      today for him.\nWhile I am there I must go to the tate and review the new acquisitions
      for Gainsborough.  But I will definitely finish M a la mode on sunday - be sure,
      I shall.\n\nWhat a pity that the chairs are unsatisfactory!\nDid you look at
      the mirror and smell the table in the other shop?\n\nDo congratulate Clifford
      on his appointment.  I think it is a marvellous step forward and upward.\n\nHere
      is the finished poem about your VENUS:\n\nThe music and the volition of birds
      spanning the sea like bridges of flesh-  The three-dimensional arabesques of
      putti anti lovers, serving Venus with the attributes of arrow, torch and apple:\nAlert,
      profane, like adjectives they spin around the rose-hub of the flesh.\nChallenging
      gravity like verbs \nEphebi of the quim perform in the gulf-stream of the sun,
      Dance to the orchestra of clouds and the orgasms of the waves above deserted
      Neptune's dented crown.\n\nI shall write again immediately\nI love you\nLawrence\n"
