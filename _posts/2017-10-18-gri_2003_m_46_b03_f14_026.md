      Pett 14.7.50
      Dearest Lawrence, I hope you are having a gay day to-day. You must tell me all about it for I have never experienced it. The weather is being maddening here fine but with such a gale of wind that it is impossible to work. I am going to wash my hair this afternoon and dry it if the rose garden which is relatively sheltered. Yesterday I worked hard on [unclear]Swiys[/unclear] portrait and she kindly sat a long time. I am pleased with my work below the eyes but I cannot get the forehead and eyes to my satisfaction. I have not started on the dress yet. This morning by putting my canvas flat on the grass I managed to put in a hay field which is [unclear]beginning[/unclear] to be cut, and is necessary to the design and colour-scheme I think.
