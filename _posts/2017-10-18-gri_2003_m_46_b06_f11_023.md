      The Pedagogical Sketchbook was published in 1925, drawn from a mass of material prepared by Klee for his teaching course at the Weimer Bauhaus. It seems to me that this symposium is bound to deal with three points: (1) to what extent is the Sketchbook a product of Bauhaus;  (2) how closely to Klee's words fit his own art;  (3), is the Sketchbook signif-icant now, nearly 30 years since it was published? Matters of art-education, art-history, and the psychology of artistic creation are involved.
      The Sketchbook was part of the preliminary 6 month course which included instruction in problems of form and experiments in the handling of different media. The student's aptitude for a particular craft showed itself in this period and, at the same time, the student acquired a basic vocabulary of form. In addition, of course, it was essential to literative students from conventional art habits. This is what Klee does in the Pedagogical Sketchbook - he offers a vocabulary and grammer of form that is pedagogic and anti-academic simultaneously. This was not Klee's only activity at the Bauhaus but it was his most fruit-ful one. He was in charge of the metal workshops for a time, the students turning out under his direction 'spiritual samovars and intellectual doorknobs' (1). Mcholy-Hagy took over in this workshop in 1923 and changed to the mass-production of llighting-fixtures.
      However, though Klee, with Kandinski and Feininger, were defic-ient as technicians their role in the Bauhaus was essential.

      ful one.  He was in charge of the metal workshops for a time,

      workshop in 1923 and changed to the mass-production of lighting-

      The Pedagogical Sketchbook was published in 1925, drawn from
      a mass of material perpared by Klee for his teaching course
      at the Weimer Bauhaus. It seems to me that this symposium
      is bound to deal with three points: (1) to what extent is
      the Sketchbook a product of the Bauhaus; (2) how closely do
      Klee's words fit his own art; and (3), is the Sketchbook signif-
      icant now, nearly 30 years since it was published? Matters
      of art-education, art-history, and the psychology of artistic
      creation are involved.
      The Sketchbook was part of the preliminary 6 month course
      which included instruction in problems of form and experiments
      in the handling of different media. The student's aptitude
      for a particular craft showed itself in this period and, at

      workshop in 1923 and changed to the mass-production of lighting-
      fixtures.
      However, though Klee, with Kandinski and Feininger, were defic-
      ient as technicians their role in the Beuhaus was essential.
