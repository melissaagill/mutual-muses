      Cambridge
      Dearest Lawrence,
      I do hope your cold is quite gone
      now, or at any rate mild - and that
      you enjoyed your double-programme
      with Paul after a successful lecture.
      I am looking forward to hearing all
      about it.
      I had a very comfortable journey
      here and M. met me; this place
      is very easy to reach, and much more
      comfortable and friendly than Henry's.
      I am really not going to do any-
      thing today as my back aches - but
      this evening we are going to a Pantomime-
      Cinderella. I hope it is funny! I
      am about to go and meet M for lunch
      and see his new show - which won't
      hang yet. There are 3 [unclear]Iltiyls[/unclear] - but
      he says he has been sent lots of
      pictures he did not choosd - and so
      they are not so good.
