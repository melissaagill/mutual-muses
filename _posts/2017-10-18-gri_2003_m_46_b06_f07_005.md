      Dearest Sylvia:
      Well, you leave the choice of journey to town on Saturday to me. As you suspect the bus 'will  be hell' - that is out. If you come by train, Victoria is out of the way. So, why don't you come to Charing X on the 2.10 and wait for me at the N.G.? I assume you will do that. I'll meet you in the NG about 4.30. I suggest in one of the newly opened Italian rooms which you saw when you were here last.
      I will send the Brian Orme a post card about my time of arrival. How nice your Aunt is being. I do long to see you and to be in Wales. I've only been in S.Wales before - and that was years ago.

      Blackheath
      2/7

      Dearest Sylvia:
      Well, you leave the choice of journey to town on Saturday to me. As you suspect the bus 'will be hell' - that is out. If you come by train, Victoria is out of the way. So, why don't you come to Charing X on the 2.10 and wait for me at the N.G.? I assume you will do that. I'll meet you in the NG about 4.30. I suggest in one of the newly opened Italian rooms which you saw when you were here last.

      I will send the [unclear]Brion Orume[/unclear] a post card about my time of arrival.  How nice your aunt is being. I do long to see you and to be in Wales. I've only been in S. Wales before - and that was years ago.

      The Cordells asked after you last night,
