                                    [unclear]?[/unclear] Wednesday.

      Dearest Lawrence,
                     Thank you so much for your
      letter and the delightful enclosure.
      It looks very splendid, and won-
      erfully tasteful for the period --
      perhaps not so good in detail.
      How does it compare with Ver-
      sailles?  I have never seen
      the interior.  [unclear]M.[/unclear] thinks not very
      well.
               Please excuse pencil but I am
      writing this in the reference library
      before going to a sale to buy
      (if the price be reasonable) some
      linen.
            Clifford was very stuck by
      your article -- and although very
      tired enjoyed it so much that
      he read it all before going to
      bed -- Your definition of

      Pett 22-?-51
      ? Wednesday

      Dearest Lawrence,
      Thank you so much for your letter and the delightful enclosure. It looks very splendid, and wonderfully tasteful for the period - perhaps not so good - detail. How does it compare with Versailles? I have never seen the interior. Me thinks not very well.
      Please excuse pencil but I am writing this in the reference library before going to a sale to buy (if the price be reasonable) some linen.
