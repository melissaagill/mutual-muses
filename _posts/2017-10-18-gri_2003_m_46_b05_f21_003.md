    clean_transcription: 3. Pett<br/>Having arrived safely and looked <br/>up my mail
      I find that Michael<br/>would like me to meet him<br/>at 9:30 p.m. Kensington
      High St.<br/>on Sunday so I shall go as<br/>I don't know when he will be<br/>in
      town again as I think he has<br/>Monday off. I shall catch<br/>the 9:10 train
      from Hastings arriving<br/>on London Bridge at 11:20. I shall<br/>bring only
      a hold-all so do<br/>not bother to meet me - I hope<br/>to be with you at about
      12:00.<br/>I hope this is not inconvenient.<br/>It will be wonderful to see
      you<br/>again so soon. I have the <br/>powder and lipstick from Mrs. Sleigh<br/>and
      another letter from Aunt Elsie.
