      THE SOCIETY FOR EDUCATION IN ART
      29 TAVISTOCK SQUARE LONDON WC 1
      Dearest Sylvia
      I have just seen Miss Chidd and learned from
      her that I m to be interviewed for the Tate
      Gallery position.  She is one of my referees,
      you may remember.  It is a change to have
      some good or at least potential good--
      premiring news to give you.
      There may be a letter at home for me
      but as I spent the night at Wimbledon I have
      not had my mail yet.
      The Kensington Art Gallery, I think, will
      send you an invitation.  When I rang up
      Clare was not there but I explained the sit-
      uation to a man who made a note of
      your name or said he would see to it.
      The post office where I am writing this note
      is full of people filling in little pieces of
      dedered paper and attaching postal orders.
      Pools, I fear in this island, are replacing dives.
      I may as well come into the open--
      I mean underground--to say I regret the
      substitution
