      3    evening.  I have done the worst
      now.  I'm just weed a bit and
      put in any plants where I can
      also put in some more spinach and
      lettuce!
      This morning I must prime some
      canvas before I can get on with
      another landscape.  I think I shall
      work on the one of Tiny in the
      hat again to see if I can impr-
      ove it before abandoning it com-
      pletely.
      Preparations for the Fete are going
      full saving.  Tiny seems less worried
      this year.
      I shall finish this ow as i can
      then catch the morning post.
      I love you so much--dear love
      and am longing to see you.
      I love you
      Sylvia
