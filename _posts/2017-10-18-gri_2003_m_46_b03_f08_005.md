      (v)

      Though we would not willingly maroon
      A helpful girl on a desert island,
      Once the heroine were there
      Corkscrewed by despair,
      We would applaud her terror at being alone,
      Myth of the tortured girl, eyes raw with sand.

      Her death and apotheosis above the palms
      Sublimated to the attic of the moon,
      Crown her terror in this place
      With constellation's sterile lace.
      Do not, Muses of Order, permit alarms
      Of white, asymmetrical pantaloons.

      (vi)

      Turn consoling sommersaults
      On the pagan altar and assault

      The local girls after this offering,
      Crackpot huntress or nymphs dancing

      In bland, harmonious routine:
      Discord of flesh on the rustic green.

      Unburden the hourglass by breaking it,
      Use the shards of glass to cut

      The wrists of the Muses and as they bleed
      Write swear words on the sand at low-tide.

      The comedy blunders like a phallus
