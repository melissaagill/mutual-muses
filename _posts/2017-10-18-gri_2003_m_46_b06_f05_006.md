      I love you so much. I wish that you were here with me. I wish that we had actually been here together instead of only separately. [unclear]All[/unclear] the blossom is out at the moment and not enough wind gets into the [unclear]bowl[/unclear] where the city is to spill the withes and [unclear]pinks[/unclear]. [unclear]Ranisly[/unclear] view across blossom to show castle from my bedroom window.

      Sheila and Gaye (my god child) are here until today.
      It was very pleasant to find them here unexpectedly (Fred is playing [unclear]hockey[/unclear] for the R.A.F: in Germany). Gaye [unclear]growing [/unclear]is and not the least frightened of me now.

      I love you, dearest Sylvia, love you
                                                    Lawrence
