      4 I am delighted to hear that
      "Athene" was out so puntcually.
      I very much look foreward
      to see it.
      Both on young things seemed
      very much to enjoy the Brighton
      exhibition - and get on rather
      too well for our living - for
      "Wacko" does her best to vulgarize
      beside and suggest rather
      underhand practices to her which
      are rather embarrassing as if
      her mother heard it would make
      it more difficult for Desiree to
      come home.
      I think I must finsh this
      to-morrow as your letter is up-
      stairs. I love you so much
      and long to see you again -
      I'm afraid that she misses her Lion -
