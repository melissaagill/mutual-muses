      old thing. I wish you were here too. So do the Woods.
      I forwarded two letters for you - one from Leytonstone one from the I.C.A. I'm so glad about New-castle; and that your lectures went well. I hope the shoes are suit-able.
      I hope Paul will get on well at [unclear]Dand[/unclear]. Give him my love when you write and say that I hope he will do well; and paint.
      I'm rushing off to the beach to bathe and go on with my painting. I have finished the landscape this morning
      I love you in haste
