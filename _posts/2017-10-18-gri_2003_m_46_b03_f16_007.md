      Dearest Lawrence,

      Thank you for your letter — please excuse pencil but both my pens are impossible.

      I adore the new sonnet — it is delicious. You become more and more inventive.

      I hope [unclear]Besnard Gay[/unclear] is in a better case financially.  I'm sorry to hear about the A.I.A.  What about The Cats' Show?

      If you come to Brighton could you not come on and spend the day here?  Then you could see the woods and take home some fruit and things.  You can come easily from Brighton.  What do you think — perhaps you have not the time on Monday?  I don't want to urge you to extravagance / But if you will not be angry I should like to stay here until Tuesday 19th when Michael goes — would you be hurt and annoyed?  I haven't said I will so that if you are not willing I will not stay.  But Tiny thinks it would

      Dearest Lawrence, Thank you for your letter, please excuse pencil but both my pens are impossible.
      I adore the new sonnet, it is delicious you become more and more inventive. I hope Bernard Grey is a little better case financially, I'm sorry to hear about the A.I.A.. What about The Cat's Show. If you come to Brighton could you not come on and spend the day here? Then you could see the woods and take home some fruit and things. You can come easily from Brighton. What do you think, perhaps you have not the time or money? I don't want to urge you to extravagance I But if you will not be angry I should like to stay here until Tuesday 19th when Michael goes, would you be hurt and annoyed I haven't said. I will so that if you are not willing I will not stay. But [unclear]Tiny[/unclear] thinks it would
