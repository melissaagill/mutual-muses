      Oh, Sylvia, how I love you, how I hope
      for news of your which will tell me how you
      are now. Are you more [unclear]joyful[/unclear] - oh

      It's nearly ten o'clock and I must
      get down to some work. But I want to
      tell you that my feelings for you are
      unchanged. How are you & Michael
      getting on? I sincerely hope for your
      sake things are comfortable.
      There are two more posts today. I
      shall wait for them, on the edge of my
      chair.
      Dearest, I love you.

      I hope you still love me. I love you.
