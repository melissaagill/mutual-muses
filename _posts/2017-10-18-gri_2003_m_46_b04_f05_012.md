      Dearest Sylvia
      It is difficult, in a telegram, to be re-assuring; nor, as experience has proved, am I very good on the telephone. It is only these considerations, however, that prevent my con-tacting you instantly.
      I have not, believe me at once, forgotten you in my 'galavantings'. If I had, would I, when your letter did not come by the first post, have returned to Black-heath after going to town, simply in the hope of hearing from you. I was expected at Wimbledon (as my other letter mentioned) but I put it off, this morning, until Sunday. I could not wait until after the weekend to hear from you.
      Incidentally my 'galavantings' have consisted of that one evening at [unclear]Ithell's[/unclear]. Since then I have gone out only to lecture and on business - taking material to the photographer, delivering your pictures, &c.
      Can I come and see you, even if briefly! I gather your beds are depleted at the moment. Could the Woods supply a mattress of some kind? I have a lecture on Wednesday 28th (Banstead) and an appointment, which I ought to keep, with Johnson on Saturday 31st (evening) Could I come down between Thursday (29th) and Fri-day or Saturday?

      24 iii '51
      Dearest Sylvia
      It is difficult, in a telegram, to be re-assuring; nor, as
      experience has proved, am I very good on the telephone. It
      is only these considerations, however, that prevent my con-
      tacting you instantly.
      I have not, believe me at once, forgotten you in my
      'galavantings'. If I had, would I, when your letter did
      not come by the first post, have returned to Black-
      heath after going to town, simply in the hope of hearing
      from you. I was expected at Wimbledon (as my other
      letters mentioned) but I put it off, this morning, until
      Sunday. I could not wait until after the weekend
      to hear from you.
      Incidentally my 'galavantings' have consisted of that
      one evening at [unclear]Ithell's[/unclear]. Since then I have gone out only to
      lecture and on business - taking material to the
      photographer, delivering your pictures, &c.
      Can I come and see you, even if briefly? I gather your
      beds are depleted at the moment. Could the woods
      supply a mattress of some kind? I have a lecture on
      Wednesday 28th (Barstead) and an appointment, which
      I ought to keep, with Jolman on Saturday 31st (evening).
      Could i come down between Thursday (29th) and Fri-
      day or Saturday?
      At the moment I have little money and cannot reasonably
