      On steps of grass we linger as long as we can,
      Exquisite victims of the double plot,
      Played by the country and the court.

      We kiss between quotations and extole
      love by the paradoxes of Blind Cupid.
      Who quivers in my lady's eye or hair

      Or jumps, so indiscreetly, from a gallant wrist!

      (You will not miss that this poem is the result of translating Les Ingenus: so it comes directly from you.)

      The coarse Silenus, who would have supposed
      Him Epicurean, sprawling purple there
      In the half-light of his greenish cave?
      Prisoner of his garlands he resembles
      Proteus resting from the morphic nexus.

      Grapes like testicles capsize the trellis,
      Ripeness explodes with orgiastic wine
      And stainst he naked lovers underneath,
      Who hears SIlenus' long Lucretian song
      And make it macrocosmic parallels theirs.

      (In Virgil's Eclogue VI Silenus is bound by two boys and a nymph in his own garlands and he sings, for his liberty, a song of the creation of the world and early history of man. I have imagined this song (with its strong id expression) as over-heard by two lovers, ourselves.)

      How I love you, my Muse, and I am so pleased that you visit me again so soon after having been with me. Thank you for your essential and conspicuous role in these poems.

      I adore you, my ravishing Minerva, my rose,
      I adore you
      Lawrence

      On steps of grass we linger as long as we can,
      Exquisite victims of the double plot,
      Played by the country and the court.

      We kiss between quotations and extol
      Love by the paradoxes of Blind Cupid
      Who quivers in my lady's eye or hair

      Or jumps, so indiscreetly, from a gallant wrist!

      (You will not miss that this poem is the result of translating Les Ingenus: so it comes directly from you.)

      The coarse Silenus, who would have supposed
      Him Epicurean, sprawling purple there
      In the half-light of his greenish cave?
      Prisoner of his garlands he resembles
      Proteus resting from the morphic nexus.

      Grapes like testicles capsize the trellis,
      Ripeness explodes with orgiastic wine
      And stains the naked lovers underneath,
      Who hear Silenus' long Lucretian song
      And make its macrocosmic parallels theirs.

      (In Virgil's Eclogue VI Silenus is bound by two boys and a nymph in his own garlands and he sings, for his liberty, a song of the creation of the world and early history of man. I have imagined this song (with its strong id expression) as over-heard by two lovers, ourselves.)

      How I love you, my Muse, and I am so pleased that you visit me again so soon after having been with me. Thank you for your essential and conspicuous role in these poems.

      I adore you, my ravishing Minerva, my rose,

      I adore you
      Lawrence
