      WIMbledon 1967

      11 Mansel Road,
      Wimbledon, S.W.19

      22 vii 1948

      My dearest Sylvia,

      Thank you very much for your letter. It came second post yesterday, just as I had finished sunbathing and before I left for the V and A. Then in the evening I went to the Lyric to see Les Maines Salles again. Here am I trying desperately to keep in touch with French culture and you write from the middle of it: the Luxembourg gardens is where you wrote from. It is still very vivid in my mind's eye though when I was there the lawn was distinctly brown and by no stretch of imagination green. It sounds so much nicer now I must say.

      The list of buildings you have visited would make anybody but myself feel guilty. All I saw was Ste. Sulpice: I am glad you all enjoyed the Delacroix and I must say I liked his frescoes there and the ceiling in the Louvre more than any of the easel paintings in the Petit

      Wimbledon 1967

      11 Mansel Road
      WIMBLEDON, S.W.19

      22 July 1948

      My dearest Sylvia

      Thank you very much for your
      letter.  It came second post
      yesterday, just as I had finish-
      ed sunbathing and just before I
      left for the V and A.  Then in
      the evening I went to the Lyric
      to see Les Maines Salles again.
      Here am I trying desperately to
      keep in touch with French culture
      and you write from the middle of
      it:  the Luxembourg gardens is
      where you wrote from.  It is
      still very vivid in my mind's
      eye though when I was there the
      lawn was distinctly brown and by
      no stretch of imagination green.
      It sounds so much nicer now I
      must say.

      The list of buildings you have
      visited would make anybody but my-
      self feel guilty.  All I saw was Ste.
      Sulpice:  I am glad you all enjoy-
      ed the Delacroix and I must say I
      liked his frescoes there and the
      ceiling in the Louvre more than any
