      Dec. 7 1988
      Dear Russell
      I have no official status in your, Sylvia's, and
      Gil's discussions, but can I comment, writer-to-
      writer as it were, on the essay which I like very
      much.  I am going by the 15. pp. typescript with no
      author's names and with 15 FNS>  Since it includes
      Tondes, p.13, and notes in invitation, pp 14-15, I
      take it this is a pretty recent draft.
      There is also an illustration list specifying
      3 and 3 b-and-white, w. an extra 3 b-and-whites.
      This sounds very like a magazine proposal.  Is it?
      Anyway may I say I admire the text, not simply
      because it is about Sylvia, but for the context of
      related contemporaries and as a chart of her
      development.  It is the kind of prose I like to write.
      Love to Barbara and you.  It's too long since
      we saw you.
      Fondly

      Dear Russell
      I have no official status in your, Sylvia's, and
      Gil's discussion, but can I comment, writer-to-
      writer as it were, on the essay which I like very
      much. I am going by the 15 pp typescript with no
      authors' names and with 15 FNS. Since it includes
      Tondes, p. 13, and notes [unclear]of[/unclear] Invitation, pp 14-15, I
      take it this is a pretty recent draft.

      There is also an illustration list specifying.
      3 and 3 b-and-white, w. an extra 3 b-and-whites.
      This sounds very like a magazine proposal. Is it?

      Anyway may I say I admire the text, not simply
      because it is about Sylvia, but for the context of
      related contemporaries and as a draft of her
      development. It is the kind of prose I like to write.

      Love to Barbara and you. It's too long since
      we saw you.

      Fondly
