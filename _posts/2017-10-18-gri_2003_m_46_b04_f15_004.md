    clean_transcription: Pett<br/>12.3.51<br/>Dearest Lawrence,<br/>I arrived safely,
      after except for<br/>pipes, a comfortable and fairly<br/>well ventilated journey
      - the country<br/>-side was most beautiful, the dist-<br/>ance remarkably clear
      - I read <br/>a little - it seems a pleasant book<br/>and looked out of the
      window - <br/>the 'bus was a bit earlier and<br/>the Pett 'bus was late, so
      I <br/>caught it. M. was detained<br/>with lines<br/>I fear that neither of
      our<br/>water-colours have been accepted.<br/>They have to be called for between<br/>ten
      and four before<br/>Thursday - I fear this will mean<br/>Wednesday as you will
      not<br/>be home on Tuesday - <br/>I'm so sorry. Isn't it a bore.<br/>But we
      can't afford to spend any <br/>
