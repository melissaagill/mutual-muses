      that you are going so many exciting
      things - and so glad that you are
      full of ideas for plays.
      I shall come by train on the
      7th as I have a return ticket.
      I shall return on Monday by way
      of Brighton to see the exhibition
      with the Woods to save a fare.
      I shall catch the 11.15 which arrives
      at [unclear]Charing[/unclear] X at 1.05. I hope
      this is the right tram for it is
      an old time table but I shall catch
      the nearest one to it. I will
      look out at London Bridge in case
      you are there. I will get in a
      No Smoking carriage near the engine
      if possible.
      Please excuse this letter but I
      hurt my foot this morning (not
      badly it's my wretch sandals which
      I have now thrown away)
      and feel quite dizzy. I love you Sylvia.
