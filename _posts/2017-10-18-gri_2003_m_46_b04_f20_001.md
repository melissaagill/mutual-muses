    clean_transcription: Pett         1.8.51<br/><br/>Dearest Lawrence,<br/>     I
      was glad to have your letter, a sudden real disquiet came over me last night,
      for I thought perhaps you might be ill.  I am sorry it  was financial I had
      hoped it was work!  I hope matters are a little easier now.<br/>     I suppose
      Mary Phaniot assigns lectures at the Tate Gallery.  I hope you have a good many
      - it will be an interesting change, though not really preferable I should think.<br/>     I
      wonder if you will work on and finish Virginia Dent in time?  I hope so.  I
      think it would be most exciting staged - you must read me the next installment.  I
      am so glad that Paul admired my still life.  I thought it might appeal to him
      - I am delighted that it does.<br/>
