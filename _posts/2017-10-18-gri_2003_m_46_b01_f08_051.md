      Dearest Sylvia  Bath/Monday
       I was wrong. The last letter you received from me was not the the last from bath, but this one will be. I leave this afternoon. Landor called Bath the 'English Florence' : in one respect, at least, I can say he's wrong - the people. They are resolutely unhandsome & dull. Not at all what Landor's expression leads one to expect. I saw Prior Park yesterday. I will tell you about it when we meet.
      Really, why I write this letter is because I feel a little sad at the thought of you being in London yet in some ways so distant from me. Tomorrow I will try and book for Crime Passionel for the 1st. I expect I shall be able to get something. I love you, love you, very much, and your doubts and fears have only increased my desire for you and for conditions under which such feelings would not be possible. Don't forget Tiny's anxiety about Clifford's position when you think of Clifford's advice to you: despite himself he may have been influenced. I'm sure you thought of this, darling. you are in my thoughts, not only at eleven, but throughout the day and night . When alone I long for you, when with people I find myself consciously wishing for you instead of them, when enjoying this place I imagine how you would enjoy it also. Today at eleven I has just been to a reconstruction of Minerva's temple in Sydney Gardens. Imagine the memories this aroused. I thought of you, possibly during a household task, deliciously pink as you polished and dusted.
