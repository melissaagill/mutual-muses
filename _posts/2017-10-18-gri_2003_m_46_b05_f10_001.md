      2 October

      Dearest Sylvia

      This can be but a note ('in haste' to quote the Woods) as things are rushed. I will send you a more [unclear][/unclear] letter from Lincoln.

      I do miss you, my love. Your pictures at home console me but they cannot replace my loss. And, alas, I cannot take them with me where I go. That is where your locket is so delightful. It will accompany me to Lincoln.

      Lion did not stay the night at Wimbledon - but in our own bed at Blackheath, after all.

      How are you? I hope your tiredness is wearing off and that your period is not too uncomfortable I did not sleep well but I do you that you did, my love.

      This morning I have been to the V and A - am now at the Tate for a lecture which I shall stop at 3.15 so that I can get to King's Cross at 3.50 (train due at Lincoln 7.05).

      I did enjoy our weekend - I know it was a strain for you but it went very well.

      I adore you

      love you
      Lawrence

      This can be but a note ('in haste' to quote the Woods) as things are rushed. I will send you a

      I do miss you, my love. Your pictures at home

      alas, I cannot take them with me where I go. That
      is where your locket is so delightful. It will ac-
      company me to Lincoln.
      Lion did not stay the night at Wimbledon - but
      in our own bed at Blackheath, after all.
      How are you? I hope your tiredness is wearing off
      and that your period is not too uncomfortable. I did
      not sleep well but I do hope that you did, my love.
      This morning I have been to the V and A - am now
      at the Tate for a lecture which I shall stop at 3.15
      so that I can get to King's X at 3.50 (train due at

      can be but a note ('in haste' to quote the Woods) as things are rushed. I will
      send you a more civilised letter from Lincoln. \nI do mis you, my love. Your
      pictures at home console me but they cannot replace my loss. And, alas, I cannot
      take them with me where I go. That is where your locket is so delightful. It
      will accompany me to Lincoln.\nLion did not stay the night at Wimbledon - but
      in our own bed at Blackheath, after all.\nHow are you? I hope your tiredness
      is wearing off and that your period is not too uncomfortable. I did not sleep
      well but I do hope that you did, my love.\nThis morning I have been to the V
      and A: am now at the Tate for a lecture which I shall stop at 3.15 so that I
      can get to Kings' X at 3.50 (train due at Lincoln 7.05).\nI did enjoy our weekend
      - I know it was a strain for you but it went very well.\nI adore you\nLove you
      \nLawrence"
