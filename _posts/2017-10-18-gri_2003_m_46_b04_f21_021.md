      Dearest Lawrence,
      I hope you had a good late
      lunch and a splendid dinner; also
      found some useful books in the Libraries.
      I wonder what picture you have chosen
      from the Bosch Book. By the way, don't
      forget to take an 'Athene' to the Reizers
      when you go on Thursday. Also do
      [unclear]worry[/unclear] Hodders and send yout play to
      the I.C.A. and your poems to
      Sir Osbert! Poor Lion, cat keeps him
      at it!
      I hope Paul is well and has some [unclear]cash[/unclear]
      to view when you see him on Monday.
      Please don't arrange a party including
      his sister - I feel I know quite enough
      silly people - surely Madelain will know
      of somewhere to go.
      I had a pleasant journey with the
      window open and no one beside me.
      We arrived too late for the bus but
      Michael met me and so I had some tea.
      When we got back we found a letter

      Dearest Lawrence,
      I hope you had a good late
      lunch and a splendid dinner; also
      found some useful books in the Libraries.
      I wonder what picture you have chosen
      from the Bosch Book.  By the way, don't
      forget to take an "Athene" to the Reizers
      when you go on Thursday.  Also do
      sorry Hodders and send your play to
      the I.C.A. and your poems to
      Sir Osbert!  Poor Lion, cat keeps im
      at it!
      I hope Paul is well and has some cash
      and view when you see him on Monday.
      Please don't arrange a party including
      his sister.  i feel I know quite enough
      silly people.  Surely Madelain will know
      of somewhere to go.
      I had a pleasant journey with the
      window open and no the beside me.
      We arrived too late for the bust but
      Michael met me and so I had some tea.
      When we got back we found a letter
      from Cambridge asking M. to go to
