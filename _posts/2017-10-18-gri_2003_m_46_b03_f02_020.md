      darkened and the moon became very bright. The speaker talked nonsense and the shapeless shadowy crowd of people listened aimiably. I described the scene to them at Banstead & told them it would have been exquisitely hallucinatory if the speaker had said, as if one imagined him as saying : 'Let us peel the moon like a monkey and eat it is as if mere, in reality, musical &c.' The idea charmed them and the unconscious held, momently, sway in Commonfield Road, Banstead, Surrey, England . . .
      Molly and Eric are very well = at least Molly is well & Ricky is rather run-down but he is painting & begining to paint interestingly and Paul is working on an abstract painting about 48x30.
      Mother has been very unwell - a bad migraine attack for which a doctor proscribed a new drug which produced scarcely less horrible symptoms, including a kind of sleepy delirious state during which she went out & came to in a slightly obscure part of Wimbledon. She looks bad but is getting better.
      I love you so much, my beauty, you are in my thoughts continuously, ravishing, elegant, witty, creative, in, ah, how many poses. I love you Lawrence
