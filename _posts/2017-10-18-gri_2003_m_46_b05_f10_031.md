      Blackheath 26 X '52
      Dearest Sylvia
      I enjoyed my Lincoln visit.
      Lunch with Lord Ancaster & the cream of the local History Committee. Conversation: horses, pheasants (which we also eat), Lincoln traffic. The Lord Lieutenant is tall, 40-ish, with a tweed cap, and a tin foot. Charming, but, so far as I could see, entirely brainless. After the lecture he drove me at high speed to Grantham ('near where I live' as he modestly put it) across his county. Hogarth was mentioned: 'Oh yes', he said 'I've, er, got a couple. [unclear]Er[/unclear] Morning and Evening'. Actually he has Afternoon & Evening: [unclear]Bearstead[/unclear] has Morning, as I pointed out. 'Yes. That's right. 'Course', he said 'Grandfather must have given half the set away'. I mention Kauffman - as you suggested. 'No', he said 'No'. Then: 'Wait a moment. Used to have an Adams' house. Sold it. Lots of her stuff there.' [He said Adams [sic]] But, as I say, he was charming. He took me to Grantham so I could get an easy & earlier train back to town. He told me he had knocked a man over the other day. The man was unharmed & when he saw the Lord Lieutenant get out of the car he refused to complain, insisting it was a privilege to be knocked down by someone so distin-guished. Ancaster was at the meeting & address, of course. Another committee - of which he was President was mentioned - & he could not remember its proper name.

      26 x '52 Blackheath Dearest Sylvia
      I enjoyed my Lincoln visit.
      Lunch with Lord Ancaster & the cream of the local History
      Committee. Conversation: horses, pheasants (which we also
      eat), Lincoln traffic. The Lord Lieutenant is tall, 40-ish,
      with a tweed cap, and a [unclear]tin[/unclear] foot. Charming but, so far
      as I could see, entirely brainless. After the lecture
      he drove me at high speed to Grantham ('near where I
      live' as he modestly put it) across his county. Hogarth
      was mentioned: oh yes; he said 'I've, er, got a couple.
      Morning and Evening. Actually he has Afternoon
      & Evening: Bearstead has Morning, as I pointed out. 'Yes -
      that's right. 'Course, he said'. Grandfather must have
      given half the set away'. I mention Kauffman - as
      you suggested, 'No', he said 'No'. Then: 'Wait a moment.
      Used to have an Adams' house. Sold it. Lots of her
      stuff there'. [He said Adams [sic].] But, as I say, he
      was charming. He took me to Grantham so I could get
      an easy & earlier train back to town. He told me
      he had knocked a man over the other day. The man
      was unharmed & when he saw the Lord Lieutenant get
      out of the car he refused to complain, insisting it was
      a privilege to be knocked over by someone so distin-
      guished. Ancarter was at the meeting & address of
      course. Another committee - of which he was President
      was mentioned - & he could not remember its proper name.
