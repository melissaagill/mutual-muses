      Blackheath
      Tuesday
      Dearest Sylvia
      The day is absolutely still: a thin bright fog which one puff would clear away, but there isn't even a draft. Even the few bird noises are lazy and spaced out. That kind of weather fits me exactly. I wake at 11.00. Breakfasted, returned to bed, read a novel, have just had lunch. I shall read another novel this evening and go to bed early. Today I am a lotus-eating-slightly-groggy-lion. And you - how are you today, my love?
      I did see the Mackintosh exhibition: very interesting indeed, tho' rather slight as it is largely photostats and photos. 4 models and 3 chairs - 2 of them comfy, 1 un-comfy. It gave me a clear idea of the Glasgow School of Art at last. He was, really, and atrocious spatial designer. Much less morbid and 'decadent' than his wife - several of whose drawings are included.
      I love you. I wish we had met today. On the other hand, this rest suits me very well and it will soon be Friday. Tell me exactly how things are at Pett - & above all how you are. Remember - I adore you.

      Blackheath
      Tuesday

      Dearest Sylvia
      The day is absolutely still: a thin light fog which one puff
      would clear away, but there isn't even a draft. Even
      the few kind noises are lazy and spaced-out. That kind
      of weather fits me exactly. I woke at 11.00. Breakfasted,
      returned to bed, read a novel, have just had lunch.
      I shall read another novel this evening and go to bed
      early. Today I am a lotus-eating-slightly foggy-
      lion. And you - how are you today, my love?

      I did see the Macintosh exhibition: very interesting
      indeed, tho' rather slight as it is largely photostats
      and photos. 4 models and 3 chairs - 2 of them comfy, 1
      uncomfy. It gave me the clear idea of the Glasgow
      School of Art at last. He was, really, an audacious
      spatial designer. Much less worked and 'decadent' than
      his wife - several of whose drawings are included.

      I love you. I wish we had met today. On the other hand
      this rest suits me very well and it will soon be
      Friday. Tell me exactly how things are at Pett - & above all how you are. Remember - I adore you
      Lawrence
