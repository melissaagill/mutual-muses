      Dearest Lawrence,
      Yesterday was the day of St. Lawrence the martyr, the year before last I was in Perugia Cathedral where there were great celebrations. Last year you were with me here I think.
      We are all excited to hear of the forth-coming prospectus of your book - but don't call it "Hogarth's Progress" I don't like it and the woods thought it definately bad. Clifford suggested "Hogarth" - a reassessment." Marjorie said well, why not "A Re-assessment of Hogarth", of course the publishers may have their own ideas. I see what prompted
