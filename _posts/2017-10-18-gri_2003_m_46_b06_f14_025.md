      3. He was delighted by "Les Jeux Interdits" and thought it perfect - he said it was worth going to London just for that. He read your review again with interest and pleasure on his return, and said how good it was.
      I wish I were with you to enjoy the geranium and the hyacinth. I love you so, my love, my dear one but I am not myself at the moment but a changing girl! I am drinking stout on Tiny's recommendation as a tonic! Oh, my love, I wish you could get the Geoffrey Museum for I really think we could be so very happy. I wonder if you still do.
      By the way if you do take a painting to Gainsborough it might be as well to take the one with the feathered hat - I like it and it would give him a choice.
      My dearest Lawrence - I long to see you.
      I love you
      Sylvia
      P.S. I sent off Blacker yesterday - many thanks S

      3.  He was delighted by "Les Jeux Interdits" and thought it perfect - he said it was worth going to London just for that.  He read your review again with interest and pleasure on his return, and said how good it was.  I wish I were with you to enjoy the geranium and the hyacinth.  I love you so, my love my dear one but I am not myself at the moment but a [unclear][/unclear] girl!  I am drinking stout on Tiny's recommendation as a tonic!  Oh, my love I wish you could get the 'Geoffrey Museum' for I really think we could be so very happy.  I wonder if you still do.  By the way if you do take a painting to Gainsborough it might be as well to take the one with the feathered hat.  I like it and it would give him a choice.  My dearest Lawrence - I long to see you.  I love you Sylvia  P.S.  I sent of Blacker yesterday - many thanks.  S.
