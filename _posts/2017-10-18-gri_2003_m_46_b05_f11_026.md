      Blackheath Sunday Dearest Sylvia
      Congratulations on the results - social, financial, & cultural-
      of your exhibition - I should love to attend one. I know that
      you would handle the visitors perfectly. Incidentally, what
      an excellent total to raise: good for Marjorie.
      I enclose your V and A notes. Today of course the post-
      offices are closed but i wil send off your other things
      tomorrow.
      I am having lunch as I write: my pen in one hand, Gruy√®re
      cheese in the other. Then tonight I shall cook myself some-
      thing more solid. This afternoon and evening I am going
      to write: also tomorrow.
      Yesterday's lectrue went rather well. Afterwards a
      man introduced himself as art editor of 'Modern Wo-
      man'. He wants me - subject to his editor's appoval -
      to contribute a series of short articles on selected
      paintings of the T.G. It will pay 25 guineas or 30.
      I shall make a draft today & tomorrow of suggested
      treatments & meet him for lunch in a few days to discuss
      details. (By the way I am working on Hilton now,)
      Last nights party was not bad. It was such a bad
      night it was nice to be indoors - anydoors. I turned
      to Ralent with relief: how intelligent & worldly he is
      in that miliers! Madge is a good hostess: there
      was even a choice of drinks. The furniture is amazing:
