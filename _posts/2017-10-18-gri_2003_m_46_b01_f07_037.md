      must advise me where to put my bed in the Autumn when a fire becomes occasionally necessary. See below.

            Fine weather will, I am sure, continue so that Apollo can warm you as you sunbathe in the garden.    How clearly I see you.    I remember you agains the white sheets. You were never more Venetian than at that moment.    Oh but you are Venetian all the while in so many complex and ravishing ways.   I am sure that if I look in Richter I shall find mention of a Minerva by Giorgione at Pett.

            It was nice to receive your headed paper again. SYLVIA SLEIGH in blue capital letters.     It reminded me of that early sketch (in the writer's possession, as they say) which you drew early in our love.    It was the first time I had ever been sketched.     O, I love you, Sylvia Sleigh.

           Your suggestion of Tunbridge Wells or Sevenoaks is wonderful.    Knole would be a treat.    As soon as you have the date definitely fixed I shall see about arranging it.   If the Macdonalds come on the 11th would you like to make it a day earlier?   You tell me. Later we might be able to see Penshurst.

           Johnson made me furious yesterday: he tol the Poisers that he had lent you money on the holiday. I wanted to be terribly cutting.   Don't fear, I hall not be, but what a bastard he is, to be sure.   Have you noticed he is afraid of using your name properly?   An odd kind of 'slllerr' or something very odd like that, does duty instead.

            How I love you.    Imagination and reality both bring me back to that simple fact.    I miss you desperately but think of you and the time scaling down between now and our next meeting.    Really, you know, I must get back to Hogarth.   But I must say, once more, I love you and that my thoughts never leave you.    Dearest Sylvia.

      cutting. Don''t fear, I shall not be, but what a bastard he is, to be sure.
      Have you noticed he is afraid of using your name properly? An odd kind of ''slllerr''
      or something very odd like that, does duty instead.<br/><br/>How I love you.
      Imagination and reality both bring me back to that simple fact. I miss you desperately
      but think of you and the time scaling down between now and our next meeting.
      Really, you know, I must get back to Hegarth. But I must say, once more, I love
      you and that my thoughts never leave you. Dearest Sylvia.<br/><br/>Lawrence<br/><br/>PS

      must advise me where to put my bed in the Autumn when a fire becomes occasionally necessary.  See below.
           Fine weather will, I am sure, continue so that Apollo can warn you as you sunbathe in the garden.  How clearly I see you.  I remember you against the white sheets.  You were never more Venetian than at that moment.  Oh but you are Venetian all the while in so many complex and ravishing ways.  I am sure that if I look in Richter I shall find mention of a Minerva by Giorgione at Pett.

          It was nice to receive your headed paper again.  SYLVIA SLEIGH in blue capital letters.  It reminded me of the early sketch (in the writer's possession, as they say) which you drew early in our love.  It was the first time I had ever been sketched.  O, I love you, Sylvia Sleigh.

      Your suggestion of Tunbridge Wells or Sevenoaks is wonderful.  [unclear]Knole[/unclear] would be a treat.  As soon as you have the date definitely fixed I shall see about arranging it.   If the Macdonalds come on the 11th would you like to make it a day earlier?  You tell me.  Later we might be able to see Penshurst.

      Johnson made me furious yesterday:  he told the Poisers that he had lent you money on the holiday.  I wanted to be terribly cutting.  Don't fear, I shall not be, but what a bastard he is, to be sure.  Have you notice he is afraid of using your name properly?  An odd kind of 'slllerr' or something very odd like that, does duty instead...

      How I  love you,  Imagination and reality both bring me back  to that simple fact.  I miss you desperately but think of you  and the time scaling down between now and our next meeting.   Really, you know, I must get back to Hogarth.  But I must say, once more, that I love you and my thoughts never leave you.  Dearest Sylvia.
