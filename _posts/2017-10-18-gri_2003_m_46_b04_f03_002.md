      Blackheath
      I iii 51
      Dearest Sylvia
      I was able to return quite early from Chelmsford and so come home for a few hours before going to Hampstead.
      The lecture was like any other - but, oh, my hosts.
      For two hours after supper they showed me every repro-
      duction on the walls of their house, forced me to talk
      about each one, and at midnight started producing
      stuff from the attic. Among this stuff was a life size
      Victorian portrait, embroidered: this they called a
      'monstrosity.' It was mid-century and charming. My
      mounting aggression took the form of a defence of this charming piece. When I left this morning it
      had been restored to the walls, in fact in a conspic-
      uous place that I chose for it, with the light falling
      in accordance with the simulated shadows of the frame.
      They besieged me with invitations - sincere ones, which
      as you know, I find intolerable - to spend a week-
      end there, any weekend. I pretended I have their address. I have not.

      Dearest Sylvia

      I was able to return quite early from Chelmsford and so came home for a few hours before going to Hampstead. The lecture was like any other - but, oh, my hosts. For two hours after supper they showed me every reproduction on the walls of their house, forced me to talk about each one, and at midnight started producing stuff from the attic. Among this stuff was a life size Victorian portrait, embroidered: this they called a 'monstrosity'. It was mid-century and charming. My mounting aggression took the form of a defence of this charming piece. When I left this morning it had been restored to the walls, in fact in a conspicuous place that I chose for it, with the light falling in accordance with the simulated shadows of the frame. They besieged me with invitations - sincere ones, which as you know, I find intolerable - to spend a weekend there, any weekend. I pretended I love their address. I have not.
