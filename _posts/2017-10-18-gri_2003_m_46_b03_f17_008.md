      dress which is very pretty and
      made of a crepe material so that
      it has lovely pearly shadows.  I
      hope to finish Mary to-day -
      I have traced in Joseph and am
      painting his head from 2 portraits
      of [unclear]Kust[/unclear] - Yawalla has offered
      to pose - but he forgot and
      stood on his head, upsetting
      Michael's paint water, otherwise
      he has been very good.
      I must to work again now as
      the light does not last long.
      I hope to write longer to-morrow
      look after yourself - I love you
      dearest, my poet
      I love you
      Sylvia
