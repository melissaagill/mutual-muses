      poor, naughty darling.\nI shall set Yawolla onto you:  he is as stern as Nurse\nSee
      used to be about that kind of thing.  Get better!\n\nI agree with you about
      De La Tour and I shall try and\nget the book.  What a good idea!  I don't much
      want\nto review Charles' book - it would be rather a respons-\nibity, don't
      you agree.\n\nWhat a good thing the table was still there.  I was\nprevented
      from getting to the sale by an appointment in\ntown but I shall look about elsewhere.\n\nGood
      See - two watercolours finished.  I think that is\nsplendid.  I don't know when
      Fame and Promise is but\nI'll find out some time.  At the moment the Gallery
      is\nbeing painted and decorated.\n\nI can see your tree painting now, on the
      table beside me,\nand it pleases me more and more:  the design, the qual-\nity
      of light, are pure delight.\n\nThe R.S.A. sent me today a transcript of what
      I said in\nthe Chirico discussion.  They wanted my approval before \nit is printed
      in their journal.  After I had asked my\nquestions a porter gave me a form to
      fill in - name and\naddress.  I thought probably I was to be punished after-\nwards
      for criticising the speaker but now I see why....\n\nI hope your party with
      the Woods was nice.  Do give them\nboth my love.  What a pity about Jane Brown.
      \ Was it not\nShe who was Clifford's lover?  Or have I the name wrong?\nI hope
      for Clifford's sake it's not the same girl.\n\nToday I am going to town to meet
      Paul and I think\nwe are going to meet somebody afterwards:  whether I am\nbeing
      shown to them or them to me I don't know.  Tomorrow\nI intend to laze all day
      as I have been so busy for a week.\nI shall eat and read and probably not write
      at all.\n\nI have finished your poem so it will only be a day late.\n\nThe copper
      beech is a ferocious red now.\n\nDo get well soon my dearest.  Can I wish you
      many happy\nreturns of yesterday.....   I love you\nLawrence\n\n"

      [7-5-49]
      Saturday
      Blackheath

      Dearest Sylvia,

      Thank you for your letters. I am sorry to hear that you do not feel better yet. My poor, naughtly darling. I shall set Yawolla onto you: he is as stern as Nurse See used to be about that kind of thing. Get better!

      I agree with you about La Tour and I shall try and get the book. What a good idea! I don't much want to review Charles' book - it would be rather a responsibility, don't you agree.

      What a good thing the table was still there. I was prevented from getting to the sale by an appointment in town but I shall look about elsewhere.

      Good See - two watercolours finished. I think that is splendid. I don't know when Fame and Promise is but I'll find out some time. At the moment the Gallery is being painted and decorated.

      I can see your tree painting now, on the table beside me, and it pleases me more and more: the design, the quality of light, are pure delight.

      The R.S.A. sent me today a transcript of what I said in the Chirico discussion. They wanted my approval before it is printed in their journal. After I had asked my questions a porter gave me a form to fill in - name and address. I thought probably I was to be punished afterwards for criticizing the speaker but now I see why...

      I hope your party with the Woods was nice. Do give them both my love. What a pity about Jane Brown. Was it not she who was Clifford's lover? Or have I the name wrong? I hope for Clifford's sake it's not the same girl.

      Today I am going to town for tea to meet Paul and I think we are going to meet somebody afterwards: whether I am being shown to them or they to me I don't know. Tomorrow I intend to laze all day as I have been so busy for a week. I shall eat and read and probably not write at all.

      I have finished your poem so it will only be a day late.

      The copper beech is a ferocious red now.

      Do get well soon, my dearest. Can I wish you many happy returns of yesterday... I love you

      Lawrence

      Saturday.  Blackheath
      Dearest Sylvia,
      Thank you for your letters. I am sorry to hear that you do not feel better yet. My poor, naughtly darling. I shall set Yawolla onto you: he is as stern as Nurse See used to be about that kind of thing. Get better!
      I agree with you about the De La Tour and I shall try and get the book. What a good idea! I don't much want to review Charles' book - it would be rather a responsibility, don't you agree.
      What a good thing the table was still there. I was prevented from getting to the sale by and appointment in town but I shall look about elsewhere.
      Good see - two watercolours finished. I think that is splendid. I don't know when Fame and Promise is but I'll find out some time. At the moment the Gallery is being painted and decorated.
      I can see your tree painting now, on the table beside me, and it pleased me more and more: the design, the quality of light, and pure delight.
      The RSA sent me today a transcript of what I said in the  Chirico discussion. They wanted my approval before it is printed in their journal. After I had asked my questions a porter gave me a form to fill in - name and address.   I thought possibly I was to be punished afterwards for criticising the speaker but now I see why...
      I hope your party with the Woods was nice. Do give them both my love. What a pity about Jane Brown.  Was it not she who was Clifford's lover? Or have I the name wrong? I hope for Clifford's sake it's not the same girl.
      Today I am going to town for tea to meet Paul and I thing we are going to meet somebody afterwards: whether I am being shown to them or they to me I don't know. Tomorrow I intend to laze all day as I have been so busy for a week. I shall eat and read and probably not write at all.
      I have finished your poem so it will only be a day late.
      Do get well soon, my dearest. Can I wish you many happy returns of yesterday... I love you
