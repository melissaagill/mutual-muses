      day, that is about 14 hours, and I was happy & handsome all the time I felt. That is a real test of a bond. I shall steam it as you recommend for next time.
      Here are some bits of a topographical poem, in the 'Bath' form, about the neighbourhood:
      Poplars like amphorae
      Lead me to a Roman sky
      Scattered with acanthus cloud.
      The ancient wall humps upward
      Shoulders the lawn aside, as if a whale
      Leaped from a frozen sea.
      Elegantly the willows slope
      Into the blue empathic water
      Where the abbey is a blur of pink.
      I was here another time
      When swans upon the water
      Were not emblems of the will's surrender,
      The failure of the nerve.
      Strata of Verulamium:
      Neptune horned with lobsters
