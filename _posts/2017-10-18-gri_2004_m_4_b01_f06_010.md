      magazines & ephemera that have been piling up on that hideous little tray. I think the gardener sounds admirable: I have read part of her book in one of the little magazines, a year or two ago. I liked the Watkin's Shell poem very much except for the rather obvious rhymes. Thank you for drawing my attention to it - otherwise I should have missed it. I read, too, the scenario in [unclear]Horizon[/unclear] which is excellent. So in the Ayer article: his attitude to psychoanalysis is good in relation to his logical [unclear]puritinism[/unclear], I thought. Did you read Mahille on Matta? What a good artist Matta is!

      Mrs Harrison has re-webbed the chairs and, quite unexpectedly, recovered them with a gay crimson material which makes them smarter.

      I love you so very well, I love you
