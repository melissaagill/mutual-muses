      Blackheath
      7 IX 1950

      Dearest Sylvia,

      The sun is warm upon me as I type and though there is a wind I hope you will be able to work upon your picture/ Last night I went for a walk on the heath and there was an amazingly strong wind with a melodramatic sky, very sublime with lashing trees and the large sinister Victorian houses.

      Paul Southey came and renewed his admiration for Ajax and the Poet. He read some of my new poems and was again, very pleasing about them - admiring them and analyzing them sympathetically. I have nearly finished Polydore, or The Poet's Century and am working on one called Conversation Between Two Figures in the Temptation of a Saint.

      Father asked me if PMLA has reached Tiny yet.

      You ask about my lectures: the Flemish one was a bit dull but I do't suppose it showed to the audience. I am going to prepare my Veronese lecture this morning. I miss you from the audience very strongly, my learned beauty, erudite cat.

      I am glad to hear at cat is going successful forward in the little Savage portrait, though not surprised.

      What a good thing to see a nice lot of the Wood. I think that very wise - as well as very pleasant. But - an evening STROLL with Clifford... He has changed - actually walking.

      I love you so much and think of you constantly, re-reading your letters, looking again and re-arranging your pictures. Adorable cat, look after yourself, and paint well, and lots. I love you,
      Lawrence

      P.S. I have [unclear]roasted[/unclear] the tea - at last.

      Blackheath
      7 ix 1950

      Dearest Sylvia,

      The sun is warm upon me as I type and though there is a wind I hope you will be able to work upon your picture. Last night I went for a walk on the heath and there was an amazingly strong wind with a melodramatic sky, very sublime with lashing trees and the large sinister Victorian houses.

      Paul Southey came and renewed his admiration for Ajax and the Poet. He read some of my new poems and was, again, very pleasing about them  - admiring them and analysing them sympathetically. I have nearly finished Polydore, or The Poet's Century and am working on one called Conversation Between Two Figures in the Temptation of a Saint.

      Father asked me if PMLA has reached Tiny yet.

      You asked about my lectures: the Flemish one was a bit dull but I don't suppose it showed to the audience. I am going to prepare my Veronese lecture this morning. I miss you from the audience very strongly, my learned beauty, erudite cat.

      I am glad to hear the cat is going successfully forward in the little Savage portrait, though not surprised.

      What a good thing to see a nice lot of the Woods. I think that very wise - as well as very pleasant. But - an evening STROLL with Clifford... He has changed - actually walking.

      I love you so much and think of you constantly, re-reading your letters, looking again and re-arranging your pictures. Adorable cat, look after yourself, and paint well, and lots. I love you,
      Lawrence

      P.S. I have posted the tea - at last.
