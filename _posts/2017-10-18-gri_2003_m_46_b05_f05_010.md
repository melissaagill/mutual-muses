      BEDROOM

      (VII)

      Scarred by glass or winter,
      The soft boy near the icon,
      Burrowed by names like water by bubbles,
      Is, via image, one.

      Well. It was midnight. June.
      I came in. I didn't have to knock.
      He was stretched on the bed,
      Unshaven, window open, reading,
      The lamp jumping with creatures.

      The bottle leaks on the creased stair.
      In this light it may be a head.
      The caryatid inside me,
      Spine-tree my head is bird's nest of,
      Is stubborn, veinous, and ascetic.
      But now, balcony-wise, find me.

      Ankles level with my ears prove walls
      Are walks. Beyond the humming barriers
      More slide, are fresh, eye-shadow.

      I was there all the time.
      He undressed singing.
      I'd know the words again.
