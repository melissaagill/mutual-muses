      [unclear][/unclear]for your lecture begins, I expect C. could be busy with G & G before it.

      I hope that you have a good time and Haire talks to you  I wonder whether you lecture will be first.

      I expect I may return to you when Michael comes back on Monday as he will I think return in the car. Would this be convenient? I mean of course Bank Holiday Monday. Let me know.

      Look after yourself, my love, my sweetheart.

      I love you

      Sylvia

      P.S. Thank you for the [unclear][/unclear] letter and all your news.  I hope your services went well and you finished the Muses. I very much look forward to seeing it though it does seem rather brutal somehow! I hope you have a splendid audience for [unclear] I adore you
