      London 28 Oct-  Dearest Sylvia,
      My train on Thursday leaves Claring X at 4:20
      and is due in at 6:10. As the lecture is 7:00 that
      will give me time to have a 'bite'. If you meet
      me that will be lovely, but if you cannot conen-
      iently do not worry and I shall see you at the Art
      School. (In any case I shall need a [unclear]short[/unclear] look at
      my rates.)

      Parmore was very helpful last night & gave me
      much useful information about his art, which I
      shall work into my articles.

      The weather is mild so I expect you have not
      been out much. I hope your lecture - rates have
      progressed well - (I see you curled up in the
      studio with rain on the windows.) Alas, I have
      had to go out nearly every day.

      Peter Simmons is in England on his way to the
      US so I am seeing him this evening - presumably
      for the last time.

      I am furious that time passes so slowly.
      Thursday is only creeping nearer as I am so
      impatient to be with you again.

      I love you I love you
      Lawrence

      Dearest Sylvia,
      My train on Thursday leaves Crossing X at 4.20
      and is done in at 6.10. As the lecture is 7.00 that
      will give me time to have a 'bite'. If you meet
      me that will be lovely but if you cannot conven-
      iently do not worry and I shall see you at the Art
      school. (In any case I shall need a last look at
      my notes.)
      Parmore was very helpful last night & gave me
      much useful information about his art, which I
      shall work into my article.
      The weather is vile so I expect you have not
      been out much. I hope your lecture-notes have
      progressed well. (I see you curled up in the
      studio with rain on the windows.) Alas, I have
      had to go out nearly every day.
      Peter [unclear]Einvon[/unclear] is in England on his way to the
      US so I am seeing him this evening - presumably
      for the last time.

      I am furious that time passes so slowly.
      Thursday is only creeping nearer & I am so
      impatient to be with you again.

      I love you I love you
      Lawrence
