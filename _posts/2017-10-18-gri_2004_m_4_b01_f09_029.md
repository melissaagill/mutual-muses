      Tuesday.
      Blackheath

      Dearest Sylvia,

      Here are the two books and the pen.  I hope they
      arrive safely in my parcel...

      Yesterday I got four 18th century collections of
      plays from the bookshop in Blackheath.  I had no
      money so, since the man was friendly, I have put them
      on m account!  Opened yesterday of course.  They are
      madly cheap.  2s. 6d. each.  In one is Dryden's Oedip-
      ius, and a play about Charles I which I got especially
      to read to you.  In another there is aplay by Hogarth's
      friend Dr. Hoadly which I read last night:  it is admirable.

      Today I am going to see Molly so in my next letter I
      will tell you if they are interested in the sideboard.

      Tomorrow afternoon I have an appointment with Penguin
      books.  I shall tell them my ideas thought I doubt any-
      thing concrete will transpire immediately.

      I have been looking at your paintings again--with
      what pleasure I need not tell you.  I was passing your
      Venus when I simply had to stop and examine the deli-
      cious, sensuous, felicitious brush-work.  It is divine.

      By the way, I forgot to tell you in my last letter.
      John says that next year there are several lectures in
      a coast town in Yorkshire.  I've told him we are int-
      erested.  We ought to be able to move further North
      to the Giorgione's and the other things we want to see.
      A large percentage of the fares would be paid.

      I love you, my darling, love and adore you.
      Lawrence

    annotation_text: "Blackheath\nTuesday.\nDearest Sylvia,\nHere are the two books
      and the pen. I hope they arrive safely in my parcel...\n\nYesterday I got four
      18th century collections of plays from the bookshop in Blackheath. I had no
      money so, since the man was friendly, I have put them on my account! Opened
      yesterday of course. They are madly cheap. 2s. 6d. each. In one is Dryden's
      Oedipus, and a play about Charles I which I got especially to read to you. In
      another there is a play by Hogarth's friend Dr. Hoadly which I read last night:
      it is admirable.\n\nToday I am going to see Molly so in my next letter I will
      tell you if they are interested in the sideboard. \n\nTomorrow afternoon I have
      an appointment with Penguin books. I shall tell them my ideas though I doubt
      anything concrete will transpire immediately. \n\nI have been looking at your
      paintings again - with what pleasure I need not tell you. I was passing your
      Venus when I simply had to stop and examine the delicious, sensuous, felicitous
      brush-work. It is divine.\n\nBy the way, I forgot to tell you in my last letter.
      John says that next year there are several lectures in a coast town in Yorkshire.
      I've told him we are interested. We ought to be able to move further North to
      the Giorgione's and the other things we want to see. A large percentage of the
      fares would be paid. \n\nI love you , my darling, love and adore you. \n\nLawrence"
