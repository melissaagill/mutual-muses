      Pett
      Dearest Lawrence,
      Thank you for your letters, particularly
      for the last one with its wonderful
      contents of pictures and poems--how
      pleasing they are and how I enjoy
      them.  Do forgive me for not writing
      over the weekend.  You may be sure
      it was not that I did not think
      of you, for you are part of my being.
      But what with meals and being social
      there really wasn't much time for any-
      thing and no opportunity for writing.
      I'm so glad that you had such
      a good attendance for your Manet lecture
      I am longing to hear all about it.
      You don't say how the "ward"
      one was?
      I'm so glad you are going wtih
      Anthony Hill to dinner with Passmore
      how very nice.  I hope you had a
      pleasant time with your parents too.
      Now here is a part of the letter
      I would like you to answer--
      as you know Mrs. Clark is coming
      on Monday next.  I think I shall
