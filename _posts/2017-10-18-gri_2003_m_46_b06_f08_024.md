      Perhaps your next letter will contain the news
      that your Rye watercolor is finished: I hope
      so far I liked it very much indeed in the state
      I last saw.

      Jack has invited me to lunch tomorrow but
      unfortunately the notice is too short and I
      cannot go: in any case, I have a lect-
      ure.

      I am sorry there are so many corrections in
      this letter but I am distracted by the other
      diners. I aploogise, too, for using only
      pencil.

      M. left a 24 x 20 (I think it is) canvas with
      me, by the way.

      Don't work too hard - enjoy your guests &
      remember that I love you.

      I love you
      Lawrence
