      THE DEREALISED ISLAND or SONNET FOR A GIANT

      Like winning copper the train falls
      Out of the station as the clocks
      Co-incide on lemons of departure,
      Rattles through the grimed arcades
      And runs along the roofs of slums
      Higher than the gothic candle-snuffers of the school
      And the Methodist campanile
      Rigid at the guilt of travellers.

      Smoke from the train falls downwards
      Like sand on the calligraphy of ruin,
      Obsessive labyrinth
      Scrawled on waste-lots by the bedstead
      And uncoiling rusty springs.
      The tunnel is the neck of an hourglass
      Through which we slip from valley into valley,
      Machine of time, symbol of desire.

      Complex and irregular
      As Pindaric odes the factories'
      Euclidean intestines
      Pile minatory beside the lines
      Or recede in onanistic mist...
      Muscular profile of the family
      Survives the bowler hat's black lantern:
      The ape accompanies my journey north.

      Long-sited vistas lead away
      Beyond the shadow of the train,
      The distant fields and spire are clear
      As the vivid spots of foreground berries:
      The other side past profiles and knitting
      Hills dissolve and rivers splinter
      In an avalanche of sunlight
      Mounting in the mutable valley.

      In a sudden silence between stations
      Sudden calm anticipates the night:
      This wind is the exhalation of a giantess,
      And the quivering of the stream
      Is the somatic gesture of the dreamer
      Engaged in combat or desire.
      A horse ambles, cropping grass, who may
      Drop gold shit outside Apollo's stable.

      Complex and irregular

      Muscular profile of the family

      THE DEREALISED ISLAND or SONNET FOR A GIANT

      Like winning copper the train falls
      Out of the station as the clocks
      Co-incide on lemons of departure,
      Rattles through the grimed arcades
      And runs along the roofs of slums
      Higher than the gothic candle-snuffers of the school
      And the methodist campanile
      Rigid at the guilt of travellers.

      Smoke from the train falls downwards
      Like sand on the calligraphy of ruin,
      Obsessive labyrinth
      Scrawed on waste-lots by the bedstead
      And uncoiling rusty springs.
      The tunnel is the neck of an hourglass
      Through which we slip from valley into valley,
      Machine of time, symbol of desire.

      Complex and irregular
      As Pindaric odes the factories'
      Euclidean intestines
      PIle minatory beside the lines
      Or receed in onanistic mist...
      Muscular profile of the family
      Survives the bowler hat's black lantern:
      The ape accompanies my journey north.

      Long-sited vistas lead away
      Beyond the shadow of the train,
      The distant fields and spire are clear
      As the vivid spots of foreground berries:
      The other side past profiles and knitting
      Hills disolve and rivers splinter
      In an avalanche of sunlight
      Mounting in the mutable valley.

      In a sudden silence between stations
      Sudden calm anticipate the night:
      This wind is the exhalation of a gaintess,
      And the quivering of the stream
      Is the somatic gesture of the dreamer
      Engaged in combat or desire.
      A horse ambles, cropping grass, who may
      Drop gold shit outside Apollo's stable.
