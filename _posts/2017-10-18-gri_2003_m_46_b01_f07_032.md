      If so, don't hesitate to tell me. Please don't think it interfering with your business affairs - I know you won't. I'd like to help.
      Today I have typed 10 pages about The Role's Progress. So you see I am really embarked on my book now. Yesterday I went to the Soave. I met Summerron - he is very nice.
      You wrote with interest of Klingender's new book. I saw it in the library and have borrowed it to send to you. Don't feel obliged to read it (I haven't) but the pictures and notes are very interesting.
      Mother and Father are back from their holiday and they treated Dandelion to a steak for lunch and peaches & cream.

      I love you dearly, dearly,
