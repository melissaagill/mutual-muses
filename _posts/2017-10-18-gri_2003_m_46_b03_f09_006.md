      I have written down some fragments for poems which, if I visited my muse this evening, after my lecture-notes, I may attempt to complete. Do visit me, then, my muse, this evening. After my bath would be the best time as I shall be behind schedule on my lectures. You  will see from this that inspiration and 'reality' demands co-operate for me at the moment.
      I have not yet located Proust's volume that we need - nor has McHale that particular copy.
      I was thinking about Giorgione's Christ Carrying Art - is the composition not rather Northern - like, for example. some of Bosch's close-ups of Christ and his tormentor? Does Titian have Flemish influences? We know Giorgione does.
      Dandino still wears your locket - firmly refusing an offer of mine to take it from him as it might be heavy for a coucherie. No, he says, it is not too heavy and he adores having such a large jewel. Hetty agrees with him, of course.
      I look forward to news of your history picture. I adore you my beauty. (By the way, I shall leave home o n Wednesday BEFORE the post comes) Write for me to get a letter on Tuesday as I don't see how you can catch me on my 3-day travels.
      I love you
      Lawrence
