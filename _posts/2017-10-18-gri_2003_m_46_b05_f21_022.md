      Dearest Lawrence,
      This is to wish you a very happy
      birthday and many happy returns of
      the days.  I love you so much--
      as I picked blackberries this afternoon
      I thought how infinitely dear you are
      to me, and though I might well
      survive without you.  I should not
      wish to and should not live.  I
      adore you, dearest love, my muse
      and poet.
      I have started this today because
      I felt I wanted to write to you again
      and because I expect you would like
      a long better and I am not sure
      how much time I shall have tomorrow.
      I do so hope that you are better--
      that your glands have gone down
      now--do take care of yourself
      these North East winds don't do Lions
      any good!
      My card is just streaming to-
      night, but I have the boiler on and
      shall have a hot deep bath, I hope

      Dearest Lawrence,
      This is to wish you a very happy
      birthday and many happy returns of
      the days. I love you so much –
      as I picked blackberries this afternoon
      I thought how infinitely dear you are
      to me, and though I might well
      survive without you – I should not
      wish to and should not live. I
      adore you, dearest love, my muse
      and poet.
      I have started this to-day because
      I felt I wanted to write to you again
      and because I expect you would like
      a long letter and I am not sure
      how much time I shall have to-morrow
      I do so hope that you are better –
      that your glands have gone down
      now – do take care of yourself
      these North East winds don't do lions
      any good!
      My cold is just starting to-
      night, but I have the boiler on and
      shall have a hot deep bath, I hope
