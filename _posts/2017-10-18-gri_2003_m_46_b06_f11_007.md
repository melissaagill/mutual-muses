      Dearest Sylvia

      Thank you for your 2 letters and for sending me South's. Your express letter did not come until this morning otherwise I would have discussed it in my last letter.

      I am as disappointed as you are, you know that. I will do anything I can that would enable us still to get 46. However I am very impressed by South's analysis of the money involved. Unless we can get a big revaluation in price I don't think we should count on doing the interior ourselves & having the Kinleys ready to move in as assets to outweigh everything else. As South says, there are many houses on the market now.

      I will go in to Foster & Foster tomorrow & talk it over with them. ( I wish I could have gone today but it is 9.30 and I am in town already).

      If it should turn out we cannot have that house do not feel too badly about it. We will get another one. Do not fix your hopes on this one only. If it really is going to be such a burden we would be better without it.

      I will re-read your letters & South's very carefully, this evening, so I shall know exactly what to say to Foster.

      Do not worry, we will find something if necessary and very speedily, I feel sure.

      I love you dearest Sylvia
      Love you
      Lawrence

      p.s. I'll ring up Molly
