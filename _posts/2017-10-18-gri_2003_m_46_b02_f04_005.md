      Hunt work. 'For hours', she added feeling that I was insufficiently

      memories she roused (like sluggish bubbles in a sump whose appear-
      ance on the surface & consequent bursting cannot dispel the scum):
      Ricketts, Shannon. 'Yes', I agreed,' an artist is often unappreciated
      in his own life-time'.
      A man, a farm labourer, looked at the Braque & said it was
      like a picture by someone who had been to [sic] 'the horrors of drink'.
      'The horrors of drink', he repeated hoarsley when I demurred.
      Back at The [unclear]Sudneys[/unclear] 'human nature' is to be seen, also. I
      believe I mentioned a [unclear]three-footed derang[/unclear] & her husband as fellow
      guests. The other day in the sunshine they came to sit in the garden
      & I was not far off. She is a compulsive bitch, given to ordering her
