      pulses, your belief in love is as passionate as mine. Perhaps the simplicity of my attitude frightens you? But it is adjusted to reality now - consider my lectures, reviews, interviews in the new year, and so on. I intend to ensure a firm ground-plane for the lovers to move about on. We shall be safe and loving. Custom will not stale our love - why should it? Do you think less of [unclear]Venetian[/unclear] painters after visiting Venice? Or do you know them better and love them more? You quote Auden: alright, but remember Chateaubriand. Do not fear a lonely end because, believe me, I shall never leave you. I love you elaborately and completely. Look at my poems: There I have tried, and am still trying, to cover our love from every sort of angle and still my feelings, after a year of writing to and about you, are only inadequately maped. I love you; have no fear; I love you enough to overcome doubt.
         We can stay at Stafford after the exhibition is over, for a day or two if necessary so we can see everything. I have to give quite a lot of lectures I think.
         Thank you for the rose leaves: I shall wear them in my imagination until you and I meet. Your feeling for nature charms me so much: this painting is like a rose bush responding to the music of Orpheus, you have caught its life and desire.


         I love you, dearest, Lawrence

      pulses, your belief in love is as passionate  as mine.  Perhaps the simplicity of my attitude frightens you?  But it is adjusted to reality now - consider my lectures, reviews, interviews in the new year, and so on. I intend to ensure a firm ground-plane for the lovers to move about on.  We shall be safe and loving. Custom will not stale our love - why should it?  Do you think less of Venetian painters after visiting Venice?  Or do you know them better and love them more? You quote Auden:  alright, but remember Chateaubriand.   Do not fear a lonely end because, believe, me, I shall never leave you. I love you elaborately and completely.  look at my poems:  there I have tried, and am still trying, to cover our love from every sort of angle and still my feelings, after a year of writing to and about you, are only inadequately mapped.  I love you;  have no fear;  I love you enough to overcome doubt.

            We can stay at Stafford after thhe exhibition is over for a day or two if necessary so we can see everything.  I have to give quite a lot of lectures I think.

      Thank you for the rose-leaves:  I shall wear them in my imagination until you and I meet.  Your feelings for nature charms me so much: this painting is like a rose bush responding to the music of Orpheus, you have caught its life and desire.

      I love you, dearest,
      Lawrence
