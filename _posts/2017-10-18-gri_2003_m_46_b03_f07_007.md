      [unclear][/unclear]London                                                    11th August
      Dearest Sylvia
      I have been to the Redfern but the pictures have not been changed since we were there - but I will go there again next week.
        Yesterday I went to the opening of a new exhibition at the A/A because it was opened by Robert Melvillle.  He gave a delightful & penetrating little talk about abstraction & naturalism, illuminated with erotic analogies.  He asked about Morgarth[unclear][/unclear].
         I am going to a 'party' (maybe it will turn out to be more of a social evening) at the Uhlman's on Monday.  Inhid[unclear][/unclear] is being given for some American students due to arrive here on Sunday.  I am hoping Paul Santbey[unclear][/unclear] will come - he will if he's got his fare to Hampstead.
        I asked Wally & Eric to visit me on Sunday and Wally wanted to bring Charles Perry, & Iris & Andre also.   I was noncommittal but it seems to have happened anyway -  Inhid[unclear][/unclear] is a bore.  They are going to bring much of the food however.   You are not the only one with useless guests, alas!
        It is nearly lunch time and I am wondering if I can afford to have a Chinese lunch.  Dondy[unclear][/unclear]is not sure but Matty[unclear][/unclear] hopes to persuade him. (I must do some shopping for Sunday!)
        I saw Charles for tea yesterday.  It seems Sir Henry Hake asked him if I had seen Lechester's[unclear][/unclear] picture .  If I had finished[unclear][/unclear] the book it would not be necessary but if I had not Sir Henry might be able to arrange it but did not want Charles to suggest the idea to me.   My reply was suitably dignified...  LJ[unclear][/unclear] said he was glad to hear Morgarth[unclear][/unclear] would be out soon in case he heard of any lecturing positions I might fill & a forthcoming book would prove helpful.  I don't know if he has anything in mind....
                            Love you

      since we were there - but I will go there again next week.\n\n     Yesterday
      I went to the opening of a new exhibition at the AIA because it was opened by
      Robert Melville.  He gave \"delightful & penetrating little talk about abstraction
      & naturalism, illuminated with erotic analogies.  He asked about Mogarth.\n\n
      \    I am going to a 'party' (maybe it will turn out to be more of a 'social
      evening') at the Uhlman's on Monday - which is being given for some American
      students due to arrive here on Sunday.  I am hoping Paul Santley will come -
      he will if he's got his fare to Hampstead.\n\n     I asked Wally & Eric to visit
      me on Sunday and Wally wanted to bring Charles Perry, & Iris & Andre also.  I
      was non-committal but it seems to have happened anyway.  So I shall have 4 guests
      on Sunday - which is a bore.  They are going to bring much of the food, however.
      \ You are not the only one with useless guests, alas!\n\n     It is nearly lunch

      for Sunday!)\n\n     I saw Charles for tea yesterday.  It seems [unclear][/unclear]
      Henry Blake asked him if I had seen [unclear][/unclear] picture.  [unclear][/unclear]
      I had finished the book it would not be necessary and if I had not Sir Henry

He gave a delightful & penetrating little talk about abstraction & naturalism, illuminated with erotic analogies. He asked about Hogarth.

I am hoping Paul Southey will come-he will if he's got his fare to Hampstead. I asked Molly & Eric to visit me on Sunday and Molly wanted to bring Charles Perry & Iris & Andre also. I was non-committal but it seems to have happened anyway. So I shall have 4 guests on Sunday-which is a bore. They are going to bring much of the food, however. You are not the only one with useless guests, alas! It is nearly lunch time and I am wondering if  I can afford to have a Chinese lunch. Dandy is not sure but Hetty hopes to persuade him (I must do some shopping for Sunday!) I saw Charles for tea yesterday. It seems Sir Henry Blake asked him if I had seen [unclear][/unclear] picture. If I had finished the book it would not be necessary but if I had not Sir Henry might be able to arrange it but did not want Charles to suggest the idea to me.
