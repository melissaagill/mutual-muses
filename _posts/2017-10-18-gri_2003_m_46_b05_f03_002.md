      Blackheath

      Sunday

      Dearest Sylvia

      Will you come and see me on Thursday 6th.  I have no lec-
      tures until Tuesday 11th when I think I shall have to spend
      the night at Petersfield.  So we should have several days to-
      gether, without isits to town except for Clifford's lecture.
      My big cheques have still not come but I have one cheque for
      3 which we can live on over the weekend.  Do come on the
      morning bus.  I shall be back from Southend in good time to
      meet you.  I am dying to meet you and love you and talk to
      you again.

      I have written to Birmingham, following up your cutting.
      It seems curious applying twice for the same position...

      I have just finished Symmetry of Strangers which is much
      different from the version I read you.  When I have sent
      off this letter I am going to start typing the revised and
      expanded War Films article.  I am inspired by the hope of
      seeing you in four days time to work vigorously.

      How is your contre-jour still life going?  Well, I am
      sure.  I look forward to news of it.

      On Tuesday Johnson is taking me to dinner and Blunt's lec-
      ture on Geracault and Delacroix and the R.A.  In the after-
      noon I am lecturing on cubism at the Tate.

      Time is going by and I am afraid of missing the post so
      forgive me if I cut this short.  You remember how it is on
      Sundays.

      Say you will come Thursday.  Oh dearest Sylvia, my love
      I adore you.

      Blackheath
      Sunday
      Dearest Sylvia
      Will you come and see me on Thursday 6th. I have no lec-tures until Tuesday 11th when I think I shall have to spend the night at Petersfield. So we should have several days to-gether, without visits to town except for Clifford's lecture. My big cheques have still not come but I have one cheque for £3 which we can live on over the weekend. Do come on the morning bus. I shall be back from Southend in good time to meet you. I am dying to meet you and love to talk to you again.
      I have written to Birmingham, following up on your cutting. It seems curious applying twice for the same position ...
      I have just finished Symmetry of Strangers which is much different from the version I read you. When I have sent off this letter I am going to start typing the revised and expanded War Films article. I am inspired by the hope of seeing you in four days time to work vigorously.
      How is your contre-jour still-life going? Well, I am sure. I look forward to news of it.
      On Tuesday Johnson is taking me to dinner and Blunt's lec-ture of Garacault and Delacroix and the R.A. In the after-noon I am lecturing on Cubism at the Tate.
      Time is going by and I am afraid of missing the post so forgive me if I cut this short. You remember how it is on Sundays.
      Say you will come on Thursday. Oh dearest Sylvia, my love I adore you Lawrence.
