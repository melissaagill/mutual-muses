    clean_transcription: The winter exhibition at Burlington House is Dutch Art. I
      know<br/>because I have been invited to join the panel of lectures. Nor I<br/>take
      it (from the stilled & obscure letter) for work at the RA but<br/>for special
      lectures connected with the exhibition, out of town. (TG<br/>writes of the letter
      writes like 2 Dutch uncles - but I am pleased to<br/>have been invited of course.)<br/>I
      am taking Some Versions of Pastore to Lincoln as an alternative<br/>to problems
      of art. I remember that I read sections of it at Pett<br/>one summer - including
      passages aloud to you (double plots &<br/>so on). It is nice to have memories
      like that aroused by a book so<br/>interesting in its own right. (I expect I
      shall read some of it in bed.)<br/><br/>Alone is a portrait of Dandy - looking
      up from a<br/>PASTORAL book to an anti-Pastoral view (at Grantham) from the
      window.<br/>I hope you are well - Think of me - I think always<br/>of you. I
      adore you<br/>lawrence<br/><br/>The material lining the carriage<br/>is colored
      like vomit & verdigris.
