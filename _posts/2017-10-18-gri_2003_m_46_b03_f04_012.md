      THE MASQUE OF WATER    TWO
      Stratagems of crimson
      Like the mouth of a woman
       Open shapely as Love's bow
       With yes and not no.

      Lion:

      Florna, sensual as they come, provocative garden-statue,
      offers shapely blooms; but, no, my love has flowers in her arm-pits.

      A Song by Gala Mour:

      Illusive and glamourous
      As symbolist poems, those
      Floating sonnets touch our life
      with wings as smooth as a new sheath,
      Or, see, their rhymes flashing
      Bracelets like vieux Saturn's rings,
      Yielding suade cowboy gloves
      Soft as the air of those in love.
      Tangerine velvet cartwheels
      V-necks and tartan stoles.
      Repoussoirs or lapels
      Send sight to neck and breast of swan, oh, belle.

      Lion:

      But my love, nude, makes absurd these admitted fascinating ingenuities, these accidents compared with the first idea of her body. Another time.

      A Song by Minadore:

      May is the season of early Renaissance poems
      When about still gothic moat float swans
      And my lady takes the rose away from our lady
      Her gown glides over the green enameled lawns

      In elven forests outside her castle
      Under skies that giants have sometimes marred with bruises
      Equestrian heroes keep Dangers alive
      With challenges and all their iron arms glistering

      But my lady's stronghold is hollowed like the grail
      We have it here and need not go off its trail
      May blossom froths and feathers on the orchard
      Why look for paradise higher than fruit's promised fall

      THE MASQUE OF WATER     TWO

      Stratagems of crimson
      Like the mouth of a woman
      Open shapely as Love's bow
      With yes not no.

      Lion:

      Florna, sensual as they come, provocative garden-statue,
      offers shapely blooms; but, no, my love has flowers in
      her arm-pits.

      A Song by Gala Mour:

      Illusive and glamorous
      As symboliste poems, those
      Floating sonnets touch our life
      With wings as smooth as the new sheath,
      Or, see, their rhymes flashing
      Bracelets like vieux Saturn's rings,
      Yielding suede cowboy gloves
      Soft as the air of those in love.
      Tangerine velvet cartwheels
      V-necks and tartan stoles.
      Repoussoirs of lapels
      Send sight to neck and breast of swan, oh, belle.

      Lion:

      But my love, nude, makes absurd these admittedly fascin-
      ating ingenuities these accidents compared with the first
      idea of her body. Another time.

      A Song by Minadore:

      May is the season of early Renaissance poems
      When about the still gothic moat float swans
      And my lady takes the rose away from our lady
      Her gown glides over the green enamelled lawns

      In eleven forests outside her castle
      Under skies that giants have sometimes marred with bruises
      Equestrian heroes keep Dangers alive
      With challenges and all their iron arms glistering

      But my lady's stronghold is hollowed like the grail
      We have it here and need not go off on its trail
      May blossom froths and feathers on the orchard
      Why look for paradise higher than fruit's promised fall
