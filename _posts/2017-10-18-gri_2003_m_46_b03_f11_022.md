      Dearest Sylvia
             A green Christmas means a full cemetry; green Christmas, white Easter; ONly a fools lends his Umbrella; the unjust barrows the Just's Umbrella...You have a new gnomic lion at your
      service: Mother has given me an enormous Dictionary of Quotation.  Most useful reading before parties.  Talk-ing of parties Molly's was a great success and I enjoyed it.  Yesterday [unclear]morning[/unclear] I paid for my frivality with a formidable hangover.   (I expect there is something in the dictionary of quotes.  to cover that.)  So I was sacred to go for a short walk one the common.  Today I am well.  I do hope that you are also, my lone, & that you are I eating & drinking ' as much as I am .  Other presents include various bottle & poweders, socks (pretty), soap, and The Midici - that new book we saw advertized the other day.
          So far Xmas has been, in the Wimbledon context, quite pleasing and I have presuaded Mother to invite Paul [unclear]Southery[/unclear] her for Boxing Day, so that will help your lion.  I hope that Hetty is being a good girl & speding time in the kitchen as well as before the mirror.  Lionel & Warrily are back & they are very boring & lose.  Lionel has abandoned all his Xmas engagements, I hear....

      Wimbledon
      Dearest Sylvia
      A green Christmas means a full cemetery; green Christmas, white Easter; only a fool lends his Umbrella; the unjust borrows the
      Just's Umbrella... You have a new gnomic lion at your
      service: mother has given me an enormous Dictionary of
      Quotations. Most useful reading before parties. Talk-
      ing of parties Molly's was a great success and I enjoyed
      it. Yesterday however I paid for my frivolity with
      a formidable hangover. (I expect there is something
      in the dictionary of quotes to cover that.) So I was
      forced to go for a vast walk over the common. Today
      I am well. I do hope that you are also, my love
      & that you are'eating and drinking' as much as I am.
      Other presents include various bottles & powders,
      socks (Hetty), soap, and The Medici - that new
      book in the advertiser the other day.
      So far X'mas has been, in the Wimbledon context,
      quite pleasing and I have persauded Mother to invite
      Paul Southey here for Boxing day, so that will
      help your lion. I hope that Hetty is being a good girl
      & spending time in the kitchen as well as before the
      mirror. Li[unclear][/unclear]onel & Wassily are back & they
      are very loving & close. Lionel has abandoned all
      his X'mas engagements, I hear...
