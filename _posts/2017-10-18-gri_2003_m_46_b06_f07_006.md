      most warmly. They gave me a lonely
      meal - fried chicken - heaps of wine.
      Frank's had a small nervous collapse -
      but is better now. They like the Trav-
      el Agent a lot. There are also plans
      for art films and institutional films,
      to be made & Frank, John, and me.
      (That is one reason why I don't think
      I'll even apply for S. Africa).

      I have to get on entirely new lecture
      ready on T.S. Recent Acquisitions
      for the afternoon: Mansu, Bacon,
      Allen Reynolds... (I must - as you say - fly.)

      I love you, my darling. I long
      for Saturday. See you ltr.

      I adore you

      - heaps of wine. Franks had a small nervous collapse - but is better now. They
      like the Trois el Agent a lot. There are also plans for art films and instructional
      films, to be made by Frank, John, and me. (That is one reason why I don''t think
      I''ll even apply for S. Africa.)<br/>I have to get an entirely knew lecture
      ready on T.S. Recent Acquisitions for this afternoon: Mangu, Bacon, Allen Reynolds.
      (I must - as you say - fly)<br/>I love you my darling. I long for Saturday.
      See you then.<br/>adore you<br/>Laurence'
