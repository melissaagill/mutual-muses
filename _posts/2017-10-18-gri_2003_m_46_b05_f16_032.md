      the only draw back being that I shall have to be there every evening except Saturday! Ah me! Alas, as they would say in this operetta! They have left out "thou trespassest" bu there are many "perchances" - date 1902 author Clementine Ward. Wonderful photograph of contemporary caste!

      Thorp is the [unclear]Simparse[/unclear] [unclear]Hoki-pokitup-itoptop[/unclear]! This afternoon I am helping poor Michael Watson with an examination testimonial - he can't do the [unclear]trees[/unclear] - I find I can! I'm so surprised that he thought I could!

      I foolishly "cought" a stiff neck yesterday and don't feel too bright today. I wish you were here it is so pretty - I must hurry up with a landscape.
