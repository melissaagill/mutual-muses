      EPICEDE TWO

      By attributes we can distinguish
          The dead from one another,
              Citizens from yokels,
      Lovers of books from hunters of fish,
          Brides from their mothers,
              Gamekeepers from poachers.

      Emblems are passports into Time:
           Sheaves of hay and hands from clouds,
           Broken columns, urns, and shrouds,
      Stone bells that will never chime.
      Canon, lilies, book, and eye-glass
      Combat scythe, skull, and tilted hourglass.

      Elegant, free-standing, in a niche,
         Minerva as her patron
      Defends the Arts in High Relief
         And the rams' heads on
      The Term of Knowledge acknowledges
      Unwritten books and the agony of sacrifice.

      EPICEDE TWO

      By attributes we can distinguish
         The dead from one another,
             Citizens from yokels,
      Lovers of books from hunters of fish,
         Brides from their mothers,
           Gamekeepers from poachers.

      Emblems are passports into Time:
         Sheaves of hay and hands from clouds,
          Broken columns, urns, and shrouds,
      Stone bells that will never chime.
      Canon, lilies, book, and eye-glass
      Combat scythe, skull, and tilted hourglass.

      Elegant, free-standing, in a niche,
        Minerva as her patron
      Defends the Arts in High Relief
         And the rams' heads on
      The Term of Knowledge acknowledges
      Unwritten books and the agony of sacrifice.
