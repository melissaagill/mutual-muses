      a splendid brave Lion<br/>to be up and dressed and<br/>breakfasted so early!
      I do<br/>hope your lecture went well<br/>to-day - and I'm sure that<br/>you
      will enjoy to-morrow though<br/>it is rather busy. I wonder<br/>if as many people
      will<br/>be at the second lecture - also<br/>if you get a good number for <br/>modern
      English - I think you<br/>said - I wonder who you'll have!<br/>     I worked
      bard on my painting<br/>this morning, working on bananas<br/>and grapes - and
      glimpses of an <br/>orange and lemon. I hope to<br/>finish the fruit to-morrow
      and<br/>the flowers on the vase.<br/>I painted only for a short time<br/>this
      afternoon as I went in to<br/>Hastings to view Dunles - Michael<br/>thinks he
      might sell things
