      3  There was an advertisement for the Curatorship (for assistant Curatorship) of the Geoffrye Museum in London - I will enclose it if I can - it was Wednesdays' "Times"
      I think I shall write to the curator of the Maritime Museum - should I address thus? Have you found names and address of Contempory Arts People? Do you know Patrick Heron's address? If I don't get the portrait of the [unclear]Artist'[/unclear] you will get Gainsborough to let you do a review, won't you?
      I'm oiling and framing as much as I can under the circumstances - but I haven't much strength. I'm hoping to be quite recovered on Monday.
      I think considering the size etc the still life with Chianti should be only [unclear]8 gms[/unclear] as it is about the same size as the still-life with a blue bowl & chestnuts.

      There was an advertisement for the Curatorship (or Assistant Curatorship) of the Geffrye Museum in London - I will enclose it if I can - it was Wednesday's "Times".
      I think I shall write to the curator of the Maritime Museum - should I address him thus? Have you found names and addresses of Contemporary Arts People? Do you know Patrick Hesson's address? If I don't get the Portrait of the Artist [unclear]we[/unclear] will get Gainsborough to let you do a review, won't you?
      I'm oiling and framing as much as I can under the circumstances - but I haven't much strength. I'm hoping to be quite recovered on Monday!
      I think considering the size etc the still life with Chianti should be only [unclear]signe[/unclear], as it is about the same size as the still-life with a blue bowl and chestnuts.
      Thank you for the poem - technically brilliant I think, and with
