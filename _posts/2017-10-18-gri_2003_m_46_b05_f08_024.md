      Dearest Sylvia
      Thank you for your letter. You seem to be having a charming
      holiday - I am so glad. Bickford's [unclear]Tower[/unclear] is a most interesting
      subject (I ought to have thought of it for you myself). i am amused
      that Audrey seems to have finished before you!
      Your purchases of the bottles sound sweet (what a shame the
      lion was expensive). I very much admire the stone you found
      in the shop near Charing Cross: it is extremely fine. I have
      one doubt, however, though you may think this silly: is it not
      a little too big, even for a paw such as mine? It would be
      quite enormous on and I fear that my clothes could not stand
