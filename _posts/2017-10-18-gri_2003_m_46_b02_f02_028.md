      The poet can divine
      The complicated origin
      Or love and feeling,
      Its convoluted path
      Below the lawn or tangle,
      And with an image signal
      The spring behind the flower.
      9.II.1969

      Dearest love, you are always in my thoughts. A wonderful felicity has occured: cassoni have been placed under the four Venonese pictures in the N.G. This, to a poet, reveals the hand of his muse in exquisite symbolism.

      How I love you, Sylvia.
