    clean_transcription: 'parts of our nature.  It means so much to me that out love
      includes this: could we wish a happier omen?<br/><br/>This is a bit more than
      a letter - it is an attempt to show how my mind works when we are apart, never
      leaving you.  My intelligence endorses my love though it cannot assuage the
      strain I feel as well as you and Michael fee.  It is time for you to go to bed
      now.  I shall write again tomorrow.  I love you.<br/><br/>5th October 12.15.<br/><br/>You
      have phoned me.   what it means to hear your voice, even though your news is
      unsettling.  Remember, my dearest, that you have admitted me so far into your
      future plans.  It is so important to me.  I know that absence works in part
      against me and I pity greatly your divided role.  But think of the future enough
      to prevent yourself being completely at the mercy of Michael''s decision.  You
      have all my love, all my energy.  All my hope.  Hope was, at last, born in your
      present agony which must soon diminish.  Oh my dearest Sylvia, I love you.  I
      must see you to  soon.  I shall phone you, as you said I might, after lunch.<br/><br/>I
      love you, I love you. <br/>Lawrence<br/><br/>I want your to have this, incomplete
      as it is, it is a sign of my loving you.  I must rush to the post now I have
      your remission to write.  I love you.<br/>send letters<br/><br/>L'
