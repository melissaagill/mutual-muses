      Dearest Lawrence,
      I wrote to Cambridge yester-
      day, but put on the back--
      "if undelivered please return to 107"
      etc.  So you should have it any
      way.  I'm so sorry Miss Chalk
      muddled it.  I hope it hasn't
      inconvenienced you too much.
      I am very interested about
      what you say of the [unclear][/unclear] in the
      Fitz William.  I hope I shall see
      it sometime--preferably with you!
      I'm sorry that Ipswich is not pleasant.
      er.  I had an idea that it was
      delightful--but I expect it was
      a wish!
      I hope you have had pleasant
      audience.  I wonder what your
      other subjects were?
      I have had a very pleasant day
      today.  Painting at the oak,
      and the view I told you of in the
