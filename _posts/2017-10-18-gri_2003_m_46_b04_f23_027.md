      will be Tuesday or Wednesday.
      Oh dear - I do think Paul
      should learn the Principles of
      Reality - but how? However
      he always seems to manage
      and is quite cheerful and
      very nice so I suppose he
      will either learn by experience
      when a very long period full
      of such things has elapsed,
      or he won't!
      I hope your lectures went
      well yesterday and that you
      had a pleasant day at Brighton
      today. My painting is going
      very well, the only trouble
      being that the light is so
      little this month - only from
      8 until 3.45 - so I try
      to start work at nine.
      Also I have had to go
      into Hastings on two afternoons
      because of the sale; I have
      bought 3 lots, which I hope
      will appeal to undergraduates

      manage and is quite cheerful and very nice so I suppose he will either learn
      by experience when a very long period full of such things has elapsed or he
      won/t!<br/>I hope your lectures went well yesterday and that you had a pleasant
      day at Brighton to-day. My painting is going very well, the only trouble being
      that the light is so little this month - only from 8 until 3.45 - so I try to

      of the sale; I have bought 3 lots which I hope will appeal to undergraduates
