      to ask for cards as soon as possible as people are asking for them and I can get some extra distribution like that.
      I hope your Turner lecture went well. I should have liked to hear it. I hope you are feeling strong again and not too tired.
      I am very interested to hear of the trousers and am more than ever determined to make you a coat for them. I will look at those patterns when I am next in Hastings. In any case I will do the shirt when I come to town - all my jobs will be finished so I shall have the time and leisure - we will buy some stuff at Liberties and I will cut it, fit it and do buttonholes and any hand work in town and machine it up here - so that it will be ready for the P.V with no trouble! I should think I could run you up a "[unclear]stun-gun[/unclear]" if you tell me colour, width and length?
