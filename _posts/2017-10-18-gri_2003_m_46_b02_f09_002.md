      I will pay the hanging fees so choose two portraits that are suitable. Sending in day is the 4th November so do no delay, it is less than three weeks off.
      I am posting, with the letter, my article now entitled 'Symbolism in "The Third Man"' to Dils Powell.
      My lecture to the London School of Economics starts in a couple of hours at 4.30 so I cannot delay.
      Do submit two portraits. I hope you are well and I love and adore you.

      Monday Blackheath

      Dearest Sylvia,

      Here, at last, are some poems which I hope please you. Tell me if you unravel the rebus...

      I enclose details about the Royal Society of Portrait Painters with two pairs of labels. I will pay the hanging fees so choose two portraits that are suitable. Sending in day is the 4th November so do not delay, it is less than three weeks off.

      I am posting, with this letter, my article now entitled 'Symbolism in "The Third Man"' to Dilys Powell.

      My lecture to the London School of Economics starts in a couple of hours at 4.30 so I cannot delay.

      Do submit two portraits. I hope you are well and I love and adore you,

      Lawrence
