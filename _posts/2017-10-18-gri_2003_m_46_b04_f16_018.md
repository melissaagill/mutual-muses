      Pett  24.4.51

      Dearest Lawrence, How fine Dandy looks as
      a cheif I see that even his tail is decorated!
      He is an Amer-Indian Eros--terrible and
      strong!
      I am delighted to hear that "Athenian" affairs
      go well.  I am most excited about your
      prospective article on "Airest and Movement"
      and except for the worry it caused you and
      the hard work involved, from the magazines
      point of view it will make it an extremely
      stimulating number.  I long to see it.
      Thank you for your kind offers re the flat.
      If I hear anything from Ms O. I will
      telegram you at once.  I fear I should have
      got a ration ticket as I don't know whether
      M. ca use the car until Tuesday.  If so
      I shall come on Sunday alone.  Will you
      do the inventory with me in that case?
      I will let you know.
      Aunt Margaret has asked us for Whitson
      perhaps we may go.  M seems likely.
      I had a pleasant journey and read
      some PLMA.  It was a wonderful day
      out of town.  M and I plan a walk with
      sketch books today as it is very fine.
      I love you so much, dearest, beloved
      Lion--I long for our next meeting.
      I love you. Sylvia
