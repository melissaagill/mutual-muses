      Dearest Sylvia,
         I am sorry to see that my letters do not seem to have reached you Easter Monday as I hoped, for your letter of yesterday does not refer to them.  Forgive me:  I should have telephoned or wired after all.  It must have seems that I was thoughtless of you - and, oh my beauty, such is not the case.
         I am glad you are more cheerful.  You make a ravishing picture of a glum cat being cheered up by Clifford exposing Jungian fallacies.  What an erudite creature you are:  I know of no one else whose court jestes has need of such learning to direct you.
         Your review came this morning and I am delighted by it.  Congratulations on making so short a review so exact in matters and yet so amusing in your way of putting.  Clifford's article is very good:  I am writing to thank him at the same time as I write to you, my darling contributor.  Athene for Athens.

      THE SOCIETY FOR EDUCATION IN ART
      29 TAVISTOCK SQUARE LONDON WC 1

      Dearest Sylvia,
      I am sorry to see that my letters do not
      seem to have reached you on Easter Monday
      as I hoped, for your letter of yesterday does
      not refer to them.  Forgive me:  I should
      have telephoned or wired after all.  It must
      have seemed that I was thoughtless of you--
      and, oh my beauty, such is not the case.
      I am glad you are more cheerful.  You
      evoke a ravishing picture of a glum cat
      being cheered up by Clifford exposing Tury--
      ism fallacies.  What an erudite creature
      you are:  I know of no one else whose
      court jester has need of such learning to
      divert you.
      Your review came this morning and I am
      delighted by it.  Congratulations on
      working so short a review so exact in
      matter and yet so amusing in your way of
      putting it.  Clifford's article is very
      good:  I am writing to thank him at the
      same time as I write to you, my darling
      contributor.  Athene for Athene.
