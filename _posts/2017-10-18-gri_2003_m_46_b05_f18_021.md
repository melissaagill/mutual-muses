      more at last. I hope & [unclear]Leal[/unclear] some account of your evening. Also about the B.A.S. By the way if you can't find a moment do go to Kensington, for I don't think I shall get to see it. Also you can ask Chase when work should be collected as you may not be in town! I'm sure he will keep it under the circumstances. We shall miss you very much on Saturday you always keep Clifford in such a good temper and make everything seem worth while. I am glad to report though that the way people are "rallying around" is quite marvelous - the community feeling [unclear]qeucrated[/unclear] by the Golden Amulet is not yet dispelled, more than 230 entrance tickets have been sold already - [unclear]My[/unclear], merchant seems to have sold the most!
