      3    to take Hetty and Dandy for lovely
      wells--and I have found
      many exciting motifs.
      I haven't done any painting.
      I hope to work hard over the week-
      end.  Yesterday I felt desperately
      tired--for no real reason, though
      I haven't been sleeping well.
      We are not having the Greenwoods
      as we have not mattress for the
      double bed.  I don't know when
      they are bringing it back.
      I am disappointed about "World
      Review" though not surprised.
      I think I should do so article of
      that kind when you have time though
      as someone else might like it.
      Kissing-Gates are marked thus

      Thank you for the stellar egg--

    clean_transcription: 3 <br/>to take Hetty and Dandy for lovely walks - and I have
      found many exciting motifs. I haven't done any painting. I hope to work hard
      over the weekend - yesterday I felt desperatly tired - for no real reason, though
      I haven't been sleeping well. We are not having the Greenwool double bed - I
      don't know when they are bringing it back. I am disappointed about "World Review"
      thougt not surprised - I think I would do so article of that kind when you have
      time through as someone else might like it. Kissing - Gates are marked thus
      "K.G." Thank you for the stellar egg - with its Grecian border - and best of
      all Dandylion within. I note the dear wols AT. I love you - let me know how
      you are - I love you <br/>Sylvia
