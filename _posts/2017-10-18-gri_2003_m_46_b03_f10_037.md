      The topiary of a dream,
      Dark indeed, can such dark shapes
      Be lovers mounted or a trophy
      Posited against the moon?

      Commedia dell'arte subjects
      And petrified tennis players.
      Poetry is collected trophies
      Of a rose the ice-age spared.

      Poetry is souvenir and presage
      Naked ardent and delaying,
      Of the lovers and their masks
      In the topiary of a dream.

      LULLABYE

      Sleep where dreams permit
      On islands that do no
      Change into whales and dive
      Deeper than we can live.

      Sleep in the palm of the hand
      Of the friendly giantess, bend
      Slowly into repose
      Like a discharged bow.

    clean_transcription: 'The topiary of a dream, <br/>Dark indeed, can such dark
      shapes<br/>Be lovers mounted or a trphy<br/>Posited against the moon?<br/><br/>Commedia
      dell''arte subjects<br/>And petrified tennis players. <br/>Poetry is collected
      trophies<br/>Of a rose the ice-age spared. <br/><br/>Poetry is a souvenir and
      presage, <br/>Naked ardent and delaying, <br/>Of the lovers and their masks
      <br/>In the topiary of a dream. <br/><br/>LULLABYE<br/>Sleep where dreams permit<br/>On
      islands that do not<br/>Change into whales and dive<br/>Deeper than we can live.
      <br/><br/>Sleep in the palm of the hand<br/>Of the friendly giantess, bend <br/>Slowly
      into repose<br/>Like a discharged bow. '
