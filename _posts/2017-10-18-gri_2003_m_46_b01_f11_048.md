      22nd December 1948        11 Mansel Road

      Dearest Sylvia,

      John Skipp suggests that I go down to Blackheath in the New Year and meet the people who are in the flat at the moment. Since the landlady asked him if he knew anybody it seems fairly certain we shall get it without any difficult. My impression is that the present occupants, though moving shortly, are not moving immediately. What I shall do, if you agree, is take a place temporarily and we can move to Blackheath a week or two later. I do not want us to delay. I could not bear to. I will take a place directly after Christmas, if you agree, and please do, dearest.

      I adore your painting. The synthesis of the different rhythms of growth is wonderful. The summer-snow of the blossom, the exquisite tone of the upper trunks on the blue sky, is so delicate and yet impetuous too. And the painting of the irregular climbing trunks is superb. When you exhibit we must certainly put it in - though with a red star on it from the opening day! It is a splendid picture.

      Our love has opened like a rose.
      The future is a bud, breathe on it, breathe,
      To see it open like our love -
      Responding to our warm cupped hands.

      Our hands, our living breath, compel the flower
      And after it the fruit, our sustenance.
      We trust the future and it answers us
      As the bare tree answers the new wind.

      There was a time when we had not this love
      And the past seemed likely to last forever
      In endless rooms of fear:

      We have it now, the gift of love,
      Sanctioned by time, who offers next
      A future dedicated to our love.

      Many thanks for your letter it makes me happy again. Pablo and the Owls are glad it has come. 'Really you've been quite unbearable these last few days' commented Pablo as I benevolently shared my cereals with him. I have not time at the moment to answer it fully but I shall write again tonight or tomorrow and tell you the things you ask. Your words of love make me so happy. Oh Sylvia I love you.

      Have a nice Christmas - I love you, I love you,
      Lawrence

      give Michael and the Woods a Christmas greeting, please. L

The summer-snow of the blossom, the exquisite tone of the upper trunks on the blue sky, is so delicate and yet impetuous too.  And the painting of the irregular climbing trunks is superb.  When you exhibit we must certainly put it in – though with a red star on it from the opening day!  It is a splendid picture.
