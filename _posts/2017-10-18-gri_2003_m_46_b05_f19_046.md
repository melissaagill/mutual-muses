      Pett. 29 - 7 - 32

      Dearest Lawrence,
      Herewith the New Yorkers. I rang
      up Beryl to-day to confirm our evening
      and as we both wanted to go
      in to [unclear]Hastings[/unclear]she gave me a lift
      and brought these without any prompting
      from me. I told her that I hope
      they would come when you and
      Chase were down, and have her
      your kind regards and she was delighted
      and is very much looking forward to
      seeing you.
      I started the picture of the
      old forge today - this morning and
      have done quite a lot to it. I
      think it will be good.
      I am going to Canterbury after
      all - but I think I told you
