      2 with regard to Pengilly's picture I have promised to cean and varaish it so don't take it if you think this should be done before the exhibition. Theres no real rush. and I can do it when I come. I have a lovely frame for Tiny Tots. I am glad you like the cards, so does Tiny, I expecting something else feel disappointed - they seem rather stark.
      I am very much looking forward to seeing pasmores new technique. I shaln't be able to stay more than a minute on Thursday I have some things I shall leave with you - 2 frames and some butter! Of all the jobs on the "Tappee" as Granny would say I hope you get the Geffrye museum but "Beggars can't be choosens!"
      I adore you "afternoon Customer" quatram!
