[unclear]The[/unclear] hotel is flashy downstairs & not very comfortable upstairs. Typical plan of [unclear]Erg[/unclear] rated bedroom:

      Tomorrow & Friday I am given private hospitality which will be nicer in many ways as long as I don't have to lecture all over again.

      I am going to lie down now. I feel tired. So let me say again, the "this is not the end of the letter", that I love you. Forgive my [unclear]violences[/unclear]. I love you dearly. You are my life. I hope you are sleeping well, will sleep will tonight. Goodnight my love, Lawrence.
