      I slept rather badly last night (first night home) and I
      realized that I was not warm enough.  Got up for another blanket
      in what I thought was the middle of the night, found it was 8:00 so
      stayed up.  What unretdal weather is is, now, after a pleasantly
      sunny Christmas.  It has been raining but that seems to be
      slackening now I'm glad to see.
      Lion has a terrible lot of letters to write--SEA, Arts
      Council, and personal letters (Hill, Martin, Pasmore) and I
      shall need most of the levy--because up early--morning.
      So I shall stop here, my darling.  I shall write again im-
      mediately.  I love you.  See you soon.  I love you.
      Lawrence
      My Christmas poem concerned the New Year, too.
      But I want to wish you a a happy and very
      successful New Year.
      Love
      L

      I slept rather badly last night (first night home) and I realised that I was not warm enough.  Got up for another blanket in what I thought was the middle of the night, found it was 8:00 so stayed up.  What wretched weather it is, now, often a pleasantly sunny Christmas.  It has been raining but that seems to be slackening now I'm glad to see.
