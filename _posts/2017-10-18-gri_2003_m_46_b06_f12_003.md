      Blackheath
      Sunday 6 December
      Dearest Sylvia
      It was lovely to see you. I am happy that Donnatt & South both approve the house. I can't wait to move in. I know we shall be very very content there - with each other, with our own house. I hope the deal goes through smoothly; I expect and feel sure that it will.
      I hope your journey back was comfortable and that you find the Rectory reasonably tranquil. I will come to see you next week, if I may.
      At Wolverhampton I stayed in The Star & Garter where we stayed - and felt terribly sentimental. I wish you had been with me this time, my love. I overprepared the lecture: altho' it was B'ham Univ. extension it was very different from the other courses. I had to simplify madly, as I went along.
      I wrote 'Newcastle' above by mistake because Pasmore was here until a moment ago. We were arranging details about the ICA show - getting fixed before he goes to Newcastle.
      I had dinner with Toni del Renzio last night: superb salad, roast duck, cheeses, wine, brandy. I've lent him some books for his ICA seminar lecture - hence the feast
