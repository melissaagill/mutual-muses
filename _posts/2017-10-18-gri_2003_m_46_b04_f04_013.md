      Blackheath  5 iv 1951 Dearest Sylvia
      Here is the Orplee artical.  I have found a few more
      pieces of evidence to add to your fundamental ideas.
      I hope you approve of them, my Muse.  It is exactly
      the relation of Muse & Poet according to G.M. Hop-
      leins:  the muse, in a short time, provides percept-
      ions (as you did), & the poet must laboriously ex-
      press them (as I have - or hop I have).

      I finished the article after my mornings work. This
      afternoon I read Nicolron's book & haste to
      tell you how just I think your reveiw.  This even-
      ing I have to go to the WIAC party.  I will tell you about
      it in my next letters.
      Please, on p.  NOTE 3 would you write in the exact
      title of Fodor's article?  I have mislaid your
      notes - I am sorry.

      I love you, dearest Sylvia, write soon
