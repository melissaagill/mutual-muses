      V and A Museum 22 x 1952 Seat 52 Dearest Sylvia
      Thank you for the interesting film cuttings which I read at breakfast and
      for the Kenwood advertisement. I shall see to it and once and I might be
      able to 'canvas' - is that the word? - The curator (a good friend of Made-
      leine's). It sounds rather suitable for me.

      I am surrounded by D. Wint and Milton literature - including var-
      iouis mid - 19c journals (Art Union, Art Journal) which are full
      of interesting original material. I am glad to have found them for I
      can use them in connection with other artists, other problems. Will-
      iam Milton II was once a top history painter - one of the truly great of
      the 30's - 40's apparently!

      I am sorry the Woods are going away, but it is only for 1 night
      isn't it? I did not realise it was so soon.

      Glad to hear the lecturer (ers) was handsome. Why take it down
      though? Exercise?

      The nobleman with whom I am to have lunch at [unclear][/unclear], is the Lord Lieut-
      enant of the County. I think I shall wear my silver tie, at least.

      Lion is reading a good study (Yale) of Songs in Iocahean plays
      called The Gn. Dramatic Lyric. You can expect probably, as a re-
      sult of this, a spate of songs to induce Wantoners, sererodes, and
      complaints from your lion - in the (quote) not too distant future (unquote).

      I am happy you are sleeping well now, my dearest. I am
      sleeping more normally also tho' I never sleep so soundly apart
      from you.
      I loe you

      Dearest Sylvia
      Thank you for the interesting film cuttings which I read at breakfast and for the Kenwood advertisement. I shall see to it at once and I might be able to 'canvas' - is that the word? - the Curator (a good friend of Madeleine's). It sounds rather suitable for me.
      I am surrounded by by De Wint and Milton literature - including various mid - 19c journals (Art Union, Art Journal) which are full of interesting original material. I am glad to have found them for I can use them in connection with other artists, other problems. William Milton II was once a top history painter - one of the truly great after 30s - 40s apparently!
      I am sorry the woods are going away but it is only for 1 night isn't it? I did not realise it was so soon.
      Glad to hear the lectures (ers) was handsome. Why take it down though? Exercise?
      The nobleman with whom I am to have lunch at Lincoln is the Lord Lieutenant of the County. I think I shall wear my silver tie, at least.
      Lion is reading a good study (Yale) of Songs in Jacobean plays called The Exq. Drawater lyric. You can expect probably, as a result of this, a spate of Songs to induce Wantoners, Serevodes, and Complaints from your lion - in the (quote) not too distant future (urquate).
      I am happy you are sleeping well now, my dearest. I am sleeping more normally also tho' I never sleep so soundly apart from you.
      Love you
      Lawrence
