      rose has become a temporal image. In
      my own poetry at least it is, again,
      a sensual symbol, undying and
      un-threatened, its victory ensured
      through renewal. It is red. It is a
      flower. 'My luv is like a red red rose'.
      These are perhaps self evident things
      to assert; ought to be, but there is
      material for a manifesto in them.
      Death is cultivated by so many; pes
      simism is banal and promiscuous,
      shared as the basis of Sartre's system is
      by the [unclear]miras[/unclear] poets of 400 years, and by
      the guarded, libido-constipated [unclear]bour-[/unclear]
      [unclear]geois[/unclear]. How indignant I am. But
      as you see I have learnt your lesson
      very well and have even tried to add
      an original variation to the theme you
      showed me. Nobody seems to have re-
      cognised this symptomatic and systemative abuse of
      a key image.
