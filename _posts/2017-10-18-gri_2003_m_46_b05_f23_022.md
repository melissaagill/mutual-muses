      Pett               28. 11. 52

      Dearest Lawrence
          Tiny made £24 88
      yesterday of which 11/6
      was from attendance to
      my exhibition -- we
      had more visitors than
      last year -- and made nearly
      £5 more --  I don't think
      I told you the finances
      last letter.
         The "Pett Coons" are now
      the "Pett Players" again under
      Banger -- who is in
      hospital and nearly well
      again,  and "[unclear]Far Maehis[/unclear]"
      in [unclear]ceste[/unclear].  I haven't heard
      anything about it personally!
