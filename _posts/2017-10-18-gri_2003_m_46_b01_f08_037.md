      lieve in your love intensely.  I doubted once recently but
      you know the reasons for this.  I adore you, Sylvia, I
      adore you.

      The contrast between your art and Michael's and your
      different responses to unhappiness seems, alas, to tell
      its own story.  Perhaps it is too deft to suggest a course
      that would, perhaps, help you both to pain; too easy,
      slick almost but you know what I mean.

      I shall write again tomorrow.  I love you and long
      only for our happiness.  I love you
      Lawrence

      P.S.
