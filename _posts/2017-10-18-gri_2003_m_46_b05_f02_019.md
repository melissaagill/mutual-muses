         I still feel tired but I hope that the ICA discussion tonight (not open to the public but a meeting to see if any ideas or views emerge from selected artists & critics) will not drag on too long.  Then I'll get a good night's sleep.  And you my love - how are you sleeping?  Well I trust.
         As you are not coming Thursday I expect to see Paul [unclear]Sunday [/unclear]& we will discuss matters further.
         Blyns - whom I met by chance at the T.G. - sends her love to you.
         I love you, my beauty, I love you.
                 Lawrence

      P.S.
      Dandy has a small secret which you must not know about yet.  That's why it is a backview.
            love  Hetty
