      In the Train

      Friday

      Dearest Sylvia,

      I miss you very much and wish that you were here with me.  If only you were here we could go to the Hampstead Arts Council Ball to which Madeleine invited me as a reward, I suppose, for writing her catalogue.  I remember last year so clearly - how fine you looked in costume.  We really shall go dancing as soon as you come back.

      I hope that your journey back was comfortable yesterday - I am sure it was.  And, tho' I tease you, I am sure you guided your aunt expertly.  The weather today is marvellous, so it must be superb at [unclear]Pelt[/unclear].  Lucky aunt Do to be with you there.

      (I heard a cuckoo this morning, at last.)

    clean_transcription: '[24-4-53]<br/>In the train<br/>Friday<br/>Dearest Sylvia,<br/>I
      miss you very much and wish that<br/>you were here with me.  If only you were
      here<br/>we could go to the Hampstead Arts Council<br/>Ball to which Madeleine
      invited me as<br/>a reward, I suppose for writing her cata-<br/>logue.  I remember
      last year so clearly:<br/>how fine you looked in costume.  We<br/>really shall
      go dancing as soon as you<br/>come back.<br/>I hope that your journey back was<br/>comfortable
      yesterday.  I am sure it<br/>was.  And tho I teased you, I am sure<br/>you guided
      your aunt expertly.  The<br/>weather today is marvellous, so it must<br/>be
      superb at Pett.  Lucky aunt do<br/>to be with you there.<br/>(I heard a cuckoo
      this morning, at last,)'
