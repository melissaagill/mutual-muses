       [20-8-51]  Dearest Sylvia,
      The weather is charming and warm and I do hope you have not too many
      Sunday duties:  Poor Clifford, though!  The main thing I want to do
      in this letter is send you two new poems and, what is the same thing,
      assure you of my love.  However I will give you a few bits of news,
      also:  father seems to be enjoying Paris and is staying there until
      Monday.  Donald Parsons is coming to Blackheath on Thursday and we
      hope to write part of the book - the Tudor section:  I am surrounded
      by relevant literature (the Old English Mansions is useful).  I have finished Ace in the Hole.  Paul is coming to dinner this evening.
      There.  That's Lion's news.

      Nightime

      Stars are palaces now embassies
      Bright for the changing owners.
      Lovers are ambasadors who know
      The place they represent,
      Whose animal is rigid in the shield,
      Whose treaties must be signed.

      Lovers represent a world of water
      Surging in every cloud,
      A world of harvests sleeping in Spring,
      A world of causal charms.
      Ambassadors are often far from home:
      Hence, puzzles in the night.

      Thorns

      The waterwagon follows
      The serpentine effusions
      Of the narrow stream
      But the drug of longing steers
      Along the tangled tunnels
      Of the buried veins.

      Discreet and sober temples
      Of the day are paragons
      Of conduct and repose
      But injected by desire
      I see the world as emblems
      Coming to a head.

      Leaves are conches, lawns are wraps
      Worn by you or part of you
      Moss is a fetish
      Roses are hallucinations
      Sweet and purple, following
      The hypodermic thorn.

      I love you & long to see
      you again.  I love you
      Lawrence
