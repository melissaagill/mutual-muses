      to be just right so that I shall have to
      do what I can - I think I can remem-
      ber well enough even if it is not sunny.
      We have had a card from the Phillips
      from Crete - Jane has been ill.
      Wednesday So far it is a wonderful calm
      and sunny morning so I hope I may
      get a great deal of work done on my
      landscape.
      Yesterday evening M. went to see the
      "Bicycle Thieves" which he thought very
      good indeed - Have you seen it yet?
      I went for an evening stroll with
      Clifford which was very pleasant, and I
      slept very well.
      I look forward to having some news
      from you this morning - my dearest one.
