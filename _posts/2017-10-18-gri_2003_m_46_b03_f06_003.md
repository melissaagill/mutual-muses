           The lecture I gave while you, my dearest, were in seat A1 (that's the place for my cat) in the ' bus was a great pleasure to me. Mrs. Brock turned out to be a charming aged American woman chaperoning 25 American girls, just out of college, round Europe. T6N6 was their first experience of a gallery since leaving America a few days ago. so for once I had a beautiful, well-dressed audience. Mrs. Brock has tried before for lectures (she brings groups every year) but she has never been in a position to give Charles the proper 5 - day notice. She was very glad in consequence to get a lectures after years of frustrated attempts.
           By the way, about France. Peter's address is 4 rue de Navarre, Paris V, and not as I think I told you 7, Rue de Navarre. Thank you for details about the journey from Newhaven to Hastings: I shall get time of trains before my departure & let you know in good time. I think it is very pleasant of M to be my host again so soon!
           I met Robert on Friday and he gave me dinner at Bertarellis: I had [unclear]martadell[/unclear] hors d'oeuvre, turkey escalope, & marron glace. Also that day I phoned various people, including Gainsborough who is not sure if he wants Walton reviewed or not and will let me know by Tuesday.
           I have just re-read your letters with great pleasure. Thank you so much for them -- they are delightful and I am sure it is thanks to them that I was in the right frame of mind to do my work today. I am going to bed now and I will finish this letter in the morning -- oh how I love you, my sweetest Minerva. I have just sent the white owl to you, its just dark and he was always an early riser, with a hug and a kiss while you sleep, from Dandy.
