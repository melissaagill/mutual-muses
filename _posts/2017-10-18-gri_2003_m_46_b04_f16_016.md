      Dearest Lawrence,
      Clifford has just returned with Michael Mountain so I have not heard from him yet but Michael  tells me that it was a splendid lecture, though the discussion was not very lively except for Clifford's part. Michael liked the look of Paul and said you both seemed very gay.

      It was very pleasant to speak with you so unexpectedly, I hope you didn't keep Clifford much longer.

      Carol was delighted by your letter this morning - she is a nice creature but very tiring! She has a very good heart and together we took my big easel into the garden and photographed her portrait - first by itself and then with her - which should be very amusing - I hope they come out.

      Pett  10.4.51

      Dearest Lawrence,
      Cliffor has just retouched with quickheal
      mountain so I have not heard
      from him yet but Michael tells me
      that it was a splendid lecture, though
      the discussion was not very lively except
      for Clifford's part.  MIchael liked the
      look of Paul and said you both sound
      very gay.
      It was very pleasant to speak
      with you so unexpectedly, I hope
      you didn't keep Clifford much longer.
      Carol was delighted by your letter
      this morning--she is a nice creature
      but very tiring!  She has a very
      good heart and together we
      took my big easel into the garden
      and photographed her portrait--
      first by itself and then with her--
      which should be very amusing--
      I hope they come out.
