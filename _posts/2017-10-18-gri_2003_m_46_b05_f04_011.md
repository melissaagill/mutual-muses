      Dearest Sylvia
      Thank you so much for your letter with its splendid news of your new paintings. Oh that does delight me. Perhaps you would send me a little sketch of C's post so that I can visualise it better. The light of the spot sounds enchanting. The weather is very unreliable but i hope you do manage to get the fig tree painted this weekend - at any rate this Spring.
      The Woods seem to very nice again. I am so pleased. You may give them a hug from Hetty.
      News of Paul: he hopes to be able to exhibit with you and is planning paintings for the exh. though he admits uncertainty about the financial side. But he does not want to have the money & not the paintings so he is painting as much as he can despite his hard work at the Irving Theatre. He is stage director of a successful new play there and is getting some new introductions to people from the producers. He is designing a set for The Merry Wives of Windsor - which is 'all doors' he says: I like the sound of that very much, don't you? Just the thing for that play. His short hair cut (crew cut) suits

      Thank you so much for your letter with its splendid news of your new paintings. As that does delight me. Perhaps you would send me a little sketch of C's pose so that I can visualise it better.

      The Woods seem to be very nice again. I am so pleased. You may give them a hug each from Heltz.

      New of Paul: he hopes to be able to exhibit with you and is planning painters fro the exh. though he admits uncertainty yet about the financial side. But he does not want to leave the money or not the paintings so he is painting as much as he can despite his hard work at the [unclear]Il[/unclear] Irving The-atre. He is stage director of a successful new play there and is getting some new introductions to people from the producers.

      Dearest Sylvia

      Thank you so much for your letter with its splendid news of your new paintings. Oh that does delight me. Perhaps you would send me a little sketch of C's pose so that I can visualize it better. The light of the spot sounds enchanting. The weather is very unreliable but I hope you do manage to get the fig tree painted this weekend- at any rate this spring.
             The Woods seem to be very nice again. I am so pleased. You may give them a hug each from Hetty.
             News of Paul: he hopes to be able to exhibit with you and is planning painters for the exh. though he admits uncertainty about the financial side. But he does not want to have the money& not the paintings so he is painting as much as he can, despite his hard work at the Irving Theater. He is stage director of a succesful new play there and is getting some new introductions to people from the producers. He is designing a set for The Merry Wives of Windsor- which is 'all doors' he says: I like the sound of that very much, don't you? Just the thing for that play. His short hair cut (crew cut) suits
