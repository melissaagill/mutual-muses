      and sorry to hear of her situation.  Still at least she seems comfortably [unclear][/unclear]
      - that's something! I am delighted to hear about the play and your subsequent
      interest in the technical problems involved - it will be useful and stimulating
      as well as amusing. I am most pleased also about the D.C.A. and hope you will
      go to what you can.  I also note Dec. 6th and shall tell [unclear]Tiny[/unclear].  It
      is possible that I shall be in town next Wednesday - if so perhaps we can manage
      to meet.  I will let you know further on Monday or wire.  I shall only come
      if I do not hear from my tenants.  There is at the moment a slightly ominous
      silence - and no rent - I hope it is only "natural delay"!  Michael is coming
      on Wednesday in any case - I may ask him.
