      I haven't really started writing poetry yet.  Only one thin sonnet the inspiration for which I got at 20 [unclear]Portman[/unclear] Square on our last Friday.

      Filigree dome
      apparently alighted
      [unclear]caps[/unclear] the [unclear]house[/unclear] [unclear]length[/unclear] well
      while an eye-lid [unclear]wanes[/unclear]

      No longer than
      a fan's double movement
      dying [unclear]ghost fast [/unclear]its flowers
      growing until renewed visits

      In this way alcoves
      though conspiring with fountains
      of plaster, perish

      Blue pink and golden house
      on the color of her eye
      behind my love's flesh wall

      I love you.  That's why my poetic impulse has waned a little without two delicious periods of inspiration a week.

      love you. That''s why my poetic impulse has waned a little imitlant two delirious
      periods of inspiration a week.'
