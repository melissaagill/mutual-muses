      My dearest Sylvia

      You occupy the foreground of my mind: a feeling of hopeless tenderness consumes me. It is difficult to concentrate on reading, on writing, even to you, because it detracts from my concentration on your image, which is especially strong just now.

      Your didactic remarks yesterday are producing immediate changes in my behaviour patterns. I went for a two-hour bike-ride this late afternoon (to Hampton Court and discovered a delicious bit of Victorian Gothic in a villa on the way) and have resolved to go to bed early tonight and tomorrow as I am in both evenings. In return you will read The Waste Land for me, won't you?

      I saw Molly and told her not to tell Iris anything about us and gave her evidence of Iris' double-dealing. So there is nothing to worry about there. I saw Evelyn McHale, also, and it is alright about Wednesday. So, now, all I have to do is hope my auto-suggestion worked as well as did that of Disney's little mouse in Dumbo. He jumps up on the pillow and whispers into an enormous ear that Dumbo must be given a chance in the circus. (the ear was the ringmaster's.)

      This is one of the poems I read you a little time ago:

      The still life on the table
      Holds skull and book
      But the lamp is hidden by the owl's wing
      There is only you

      That nest of flesh your mouth
      And the soft star
      Which gives and needs no light
      There is nothing else.

      Tonight I am thinking about Michael's prediction about our affair. Although all the material opportunity and comfort and so on is on his side I do not believe he is right. You mean so very much to me. I see I am falling into cliches of the love-letter and apologise for it but I must repeat it because it says what I mean in the only way possible outside a poem. I love you.

      A tiny prosaic note: we must co-ordinate sandwiches. I'll bring some on Wednesday if you can also do so unless I hear to the contrary.

      I LOVE YOU
      Lawrence

      So there is nothing to worry about there. I saw Evelyn McHale, also, and it
      is alright about Wednesday. So, now, all I have to do is hope my auto-suggestion
      worked as well as did that of Disney''s little mouse in Dumbo. He jumps up on
      the pillow and whispers into an enormous ear that Dumbo must be given a chance
      in the circus. (The ear was the ringmaster''s).<br/>This is one of the poems
      I read you a little time ago:<br/>The still life on the table<br/>Holds skull
      and book<br/>But the lamp is hidden by the owl''s wing<br/>There is only you<br/><br/>That
      nest of flesh your mouth<br/>And the soft star<br/>Which gives and needs no
      light<br/>There is nothing else.<br/><br/>Tonight I am thinking about Michael''s
      prediction about our affaire. Although all the material opportunity and comfort
      and so on is on his side I do not believe he is right. You mean so very much
      to me. I see I am falling into the cliches of the love-letter and aplogise for
      it but I must repeat it because it says what I mean in the only way possible
      outside a poem. I love you.<br/>A tiny prosaic note: we must co-ordinate sandwiches.
      I''ll bring some on Wednesday if you can also do so unless I hear to the contrary.<br/>I
      LOVE YOU<br/>Lawrence'
