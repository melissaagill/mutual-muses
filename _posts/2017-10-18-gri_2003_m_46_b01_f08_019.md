      and all of Pett must come") - but I<br/>console myself with the thought of your
      <br/>dear, promised letters.<br/><br/>I hope we shall consummate our love<br/>soon
      again but meanwhile what delight<br/>your presence afforded me.  Only this<br/>morning
      I kissed you, and saw you,<br/>and talked to you.  Oh, dearest!<br/><br/>Did
      you pain this afternoon? I am<br/>so full of tenderness toward you.<br/><br/>All
      my thanks in this letter are<br/>for you.  I am sending Michael his in<br/>another
      envelope.<br/><br/>I love you, I love you so much<br/><br/>Your Lawrence
