      5    morrow--if you should be at
      the V&A perhaps you could
      get me a pottery and porcelain
      catalogue to bring down with
      you then I could make out
      my list if I don't have time
      to go in and see; for they have
      a lantern at Seven Oakes.
      Best of luck for your Lincoln
      lecture--it is on Saturday isn't
      it?  I hope you have plenty
      of people at Banstead tomorrow
      I love you, dearest Lawrence.
      I love you.
