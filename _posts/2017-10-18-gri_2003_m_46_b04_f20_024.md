      2 books from the S.E.A.
      I am very glad that you have finished the 'Ace in the hole' - I think I have a contribution to make to the chapter on "She" and "S. Boutchard" - do you know the musical of the middle 30s "Evergreen" ? From playing in "The Good Companion" which was a great success Jessie Matthews took the principle role in "Evergreen" - which is the story of a poor little show-girl who bears a striking resemblance to a great actress "show-type" of the past decade or so -
      who is now old/dead - anyway disappeared - Jessie impersonates her- first wearing the clothes of an old lady -
