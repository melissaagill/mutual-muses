      3 minor detail. Inspite of your change of style it is quite cllearto me that your rhythms are similar as is your desire to shock. I feel - not always justified I think for instance why say "shit" for what is commonly known as "d[unclear]ung[/unclear]"? I do not mean to critise as I like them very much. I am just remarking.
      I am going to work again on G.A this afternoon as I must get it done and, the weather is cold, windy, and unfortunately, dry.
      Will you miss a lecture to go up on Tuesday - I believve you will? Let me know some [unclear] Kaus[/unclear]. I hope you enjoy the concert at Kenwood on Saturday.
      I love you - I long to see you.
      I love you
