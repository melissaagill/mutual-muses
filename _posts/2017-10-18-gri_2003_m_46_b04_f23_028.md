      including a rather exciting Rosewood Regency card table for 6.15s which is I think quite cheap, an early Victorian Rosewood Barometer, a little embroidered foot-stool and a Victorian chair - early and quite [unclear]wee [/unclear] which I thought you might like temporarily until we can get you something better as your other two are so very groggy - but see if you that is a good idea.
         I told you wrongly about Nones - it is like owns Nowns.  I'm so sorry - I asked Clifford in the morning and had really forgotten again in the evening.
         Thank you for your poem - it is most interesting, and I like it very well - it is evocative and mysterious.  I don't quite understand it but I enjoy it as Coleridge suggested.

      told you wrongly about Nones - it is like owns Nowns  I'm so sorry - I asked
      Clifford in the morning and had really forgotten again in the evening.<br/>   Thank
      you for your poem it is most interesting and I like it very well - it is evocative
      and mysterious -  I don't quite understand it but I enjoy it as Coleridge suggested
