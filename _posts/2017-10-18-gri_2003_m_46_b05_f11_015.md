      Blackheath 12 xi 1952 Dearest Sylvia,
      Thank you for your vivid account of Tuesday. It has
      clearly been a great triumph. My very best congratulations.
      You obviously should lecture more on ceramics.
      What a shock, however, to find a house full of china.
      Still, I remember your talking on the subject and I know you
      would have no difficulty. The reaction  that they would like
      a course is superb: no more favorable reaction exists. It
      is a comedian's axiom 'always leave them laughing': the lec-
      ture's should be always leave them wanting a course'.

      I understand the lady who wanted you till the last min-
      ute and so got you a taxicab. I always feel that I want
      not to have missed a minute of you. Would I had heard
      you, would I had.

      How charming that the president commented on your coat.
      And all your jewels: You were obviously a Wassilj.

      If you arrive at 12:10 on Saturday I can get to Char-
      ing Cross within about 10 minutes. My lecture is at the
      Tate - 11:00-12:00. So I will look for you in the
      waiting room and in the tea-room: go whereever you prefer.
      By 12:20 I should be there.

      I hope you enjoy your jaunt into Hastings: I hope it
      was fine. I am glad to hear that C is amiable again for
      when he is nice there is noone nicer. Give Tiny all my
      sympathies, but I am glad that the wood has come out. How
      did the Dr. miss it? I can guess. (I love your joke
      about the True Cross.)

      Thank you for redirecting so many letters, I did not
      realise the extent of your labours. I must have been too busy
      opening them.

      I am tired this evening after two lecures. Both went
      well: 20 people who came to the Genre lecture enjoyed it, I think. Being in high spirits I sent up Egg a bit and I have
      a joke or two about Frith for you.

      Victor Pasmore has just left: he is very amiable and
      stimulating and I have lots of material for my Euston Road
      lecture from his master's lips or the oracle divulges.

      I have saved Brangwyn, Gericault, and Bower Museum at Agnens for you: we shall see
      them together next week.
      I adore adore adore you

      subject and I know you\nwould have no difficulty.       The reaction that they

      12 xi 1952

      Dearest Sylvia,

           Thank you for your vivid account of Tuesday.  It has clearly been a great triumph.  My very best congratulations.  You obviously should lecture more on ceramics.

           What a shock, however, to find a house full of china.  Still, I remember your talking on the subject and I know you would have no difficulty.  The reaction that they would like a course is superb: no more favorable reaction exists.  It is a comedian's axiom 'always leave them laughing': the lecture's should be 'always leave them wanting a course'.

           I understand the lady who wanted you till the last minute and so got you a taxicab.  I always feel that I want not to have missed a minute of you.  Would I had heard you, I would had.

           How charming that the president commented on your coat.  And all your jewels!  You were obviously a Wassilj.

           If you arrive at 12.10 on Saturday I can get to Charing Cross within about 10 minutes.  My lecture is at the Tate - 11.0 to 12.00.  So I will look for you in the waiting room and in the tea-room: go wherever you prefer.  By 12.20 I should be there.

           I hope you enjoy your jaunt into Hastings: I hope it was fine.  I am glad to hear that C is amiable again for when he is nice there is noone nicer.  Give Tiny all my sympathies but I am glad that the wood has come out.  How did the Dr. miss it?  I can guess.  (I love your joke about the True Cross.)

           Thank you for redirecting so many letters, I did not realize the extent of your labors.  I must have been too busy opening them.

           I am tired this evening after two lectures.  Both went well: 20 people who came to the Genre lecture enjoyed it I think.  Being in high spirits I sent up Egg a bit and I have a joke or two about Frith for you.

           Victor Pasmore has just left: he is very amiable and stimulating and I have lots of material for my Euston Road lecture from his master's lips or the oracle divulges.

           I have saved Brangwyn, Gericault, and [unclear]Bower[/unclear] museum [unclear]at[/unclear] [unclear]Agnew[/unclear] for you: we shall see them together next week.

      I adore adore adore you
