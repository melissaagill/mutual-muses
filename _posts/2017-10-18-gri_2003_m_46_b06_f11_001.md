      Sunday: I XI
      Thank you for your express letter which came last night. I am glad you are coming to town but sorry it is exactly now because I am so desperately busy. But I long to see. If you come on 4th Wednesday I could meet you at Sutton. That would be better than Tuesday for me.
      Thursday I shall need to write my Art News letter. I will speed up as much as I can for I do want to see, hear, touch you so much. I'll ring Hampton Court if I shouldn't hear. Remind me of the no. tho' I am sure  have it.
      Finished my Arti Visine article just this minute. I have been interrupted all day by a chill on my stomach. I feel the end - as you can imagine. Must get on with vagritte.
      love love love you
      Lawrence

      Sunday: I XI

      Thank you for your express letter which
      came last night. I am glad you are
      coming to town but sorry it is exactly
      now because I am so desperately busy.
      But I long to see. If you come on 4th,
      Wednesday I could meet you at Sutton.
      That would be better than Tuesday for
      me.
      Thursday I shall need to write my Art
      News letter. I will speed up as much
      as I can for I do want to see, hear, touch
      you so much. I'll ring Hampton Court
      if I shouldn't hear. Remind me of the no.
      tho' I am sure I have it.
      Finished my Arti Vizine article just
      this minute. I have been interrupted
      all day by a chill at my stomach. I feel
      the end - as you can imagine. Must
      get on with [unclear]vagutte[/unclear].

      love love love you
      Lawrence
