      I liked your new Town and Country poem, perhaps when you are not so rushed you would send me a copy.
      Ditchling - Friday evening in bed.
      I just caught the bus by the "skin of my teeth" as Mother used to say - and found out the right name for the stop. Georgie was making sausage rolls - and has completed 43! So can go to bed happy - there is a wonderful new mattress in the spare room so I think I shall sleep well. I decorated the Christmas-tree with cotton balls twisted and long strands of silver to mark icicles and coloured candles and and an arch of holly and ivy with mistletoe in the middle on the beam in the middle of John's room
