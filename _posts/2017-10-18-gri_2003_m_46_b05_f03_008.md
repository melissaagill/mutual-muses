      The battle leaks on the creased stair.
      In this light it could be a head.
      The [unclear]caryatid[/unclear] inside me is
      Stubborn, [unclear]neimous[/unclear], and ascetic.
      But now, balcony - wise, [unclear]find[/unclear] me;
      Ankles level with my ears prove walls
      Are [unclear]walks[/unclear]. Beyond the humming barrier
      More slide, are [unclear]fresh[/unclear], eye shadow.
      I was there all the time.
      He undressed singing.
      I'd know the words again.
      I'll know him again: he was my size.
      Hatless for comfort....

      The battle leaks on the creased stair.
      In this light it could be a head.
      The caryatid inside me is
      Stubborn, heinous, and ascetic.
      But now, balcony-wise, find me;
      Ankles leves with my eary prove walls
      Are walks. Beyond the humming barriers
      More slide, are fresh,eye shadow.

      I was there all the time.
      He witnessed singing.
      I'd draw the words again.
      I'll know him again: he was my size.

      Hatless for comfort ....
