      LYRICS FOR SYLVIA

      i THE SINGULARITY OF LOVERS

      The wild men shiver in the wet bocages
      Surviving by the strength of winter morons,
      The bags beneath their eyes like testicles:

      But platonists who sacrifice the flesh
      Appreciate the poised geometry
      Of temples, like the one at Tivoli.

      Only lovers erect from instinct
      The ivory tower in the cul de sac,
      Reconciling intellect and flesh.

      So I can suffer still, the lover finds,
      As he falls like a cowboy from Time's back
      Who had carried him two years from his first love.

      Though Time had altered flowers and conjured others,
      Time had not moved the lover from the range
      Of Cupid's arrows, Indian-renewed.

      Niether the enchantment and the pleasure,
      Nor the bouts with rustler solitude
      Are less feathered or milder than before.

      iii GLASS IN A BOMBED CITY

      Mirrors are lucky that know
      Your breasts your hair
      Mirrors break that never held
      Your breasts your hair

      LYRICS FOR SYLVIA

      i THE SINGULARITY OF LOVERS

      The wild men shiver in the wet bocages
      Surviving by the strenght of winter morons,
      The bags beneath their eyes like testicles:

      But platonists who sacrifice the flesh
      Appreciate the poised geometry
      Of temples, like the one at Tivoli.

      Only lovers erect from instinct
      the ivory tower in the cul de sac,
      Reconciling intellect and flesh.

      ii

      So I can suffer still, the lover finds,
      As he falls like a cowboy from Time's back
      Who had carried him two years from his first love.

      Though Time had altered flowers and conjured others,
      Time had not moved the lover from the range
      Of Cupid's arrows, Indian-renewed.

      Neither the enchantment and the pleasure,
      Nor the bouts with rustler solitude
      Are less feathered or milder than before.

      iii GLASS IN A BOMBED CITY

      Mirrors are lucky that know
         Your breasts your hair
      Mirrors break that never held
         Your breasts your hair
