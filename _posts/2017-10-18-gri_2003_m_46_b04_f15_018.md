      Monday

      Dearest Lawrence
      A not to say that I shall
      put the picture on the 10.10
      to Charing Cross to-morrow Tuesday
      20th so that it will arrive about
      12.5 or 12.10. Then if by any
      unhappy chance the glass should
      be broken you could get another
      cut while you wait at the local
      builder's office (Blow & Co)
      for instance) from the large piece
      of glass there is behind the bath.
      the exact size is 15x23 3/8
      I think it best to send in the
      two water colours. (Please could
      you stick some brown paper
      strip round too.) Thank you
      so much.
      The only oil I think worthy
      to send in is "Ajax and the Poet"

    clean_transcription: Pett  Monday <br/>Dearest Lawrence <br/>A note to say that
      I shall put the picture on the 10.10 to Charing Cross to-morrow Tuesday 20th.
      so that will arrive about 12.5 or 12.10. Then if by any unhappy chance the glass
      should be broken you could get another cut while you wait at the local builder's
      office (Blow + Co for instance) from the large piece of glass there is behind
      the bath. the eyact size is 15 x 23 3/8 . <br/>I think it is best to send in
      the two water colours. (Please could you stick some brown-paper strips around
      too.) Thank you so much. <br/>The only oil I think worth to send in is "Ajax
      and the poet"
