      icism of my baroque essay won't hold
      here. I hope to finish this chapter
      in three days and I look forward to get-
      ting on to the paintings where I can
      be more personal.

      You will be amused that today I
      bought, not a half-crown, but a five
      shilling book of stamps. I anticip-
      ate writing a lot of letters. I wond-
      er what they think at Pett post-office?
      Dandylion's paw much be familiar to
      them by now.

      I hope two letters on your first day
      back will not bother you. Perhaps I
      should let you rest completely. But
      I believe letters would be better than
      silence. Tell me if you think not.
      I want to make amends for hurting you.

      I have had cause to complain that I
      have memories of you in too many places
      where I go often in the course of my
      work and relaxation. (Actually I would
      not have it another way as you know but
      you know what I mean.) How, now, shall
      I be able to near Studio One with-
      out memories of your exquisite presence
      in your blue dress, and your grey coat
      on your shoulders with the hood elegant-
      ly careless. Oh, you are so beautiful,
      and I want to tell you my delight at
      every gesture and garment and expression.

      I hope to finish this chapter <br/>in three days and I look forward to get-<br/>ting
      on to the paintings where I can<br/>be more personal.<br/><br/>You will be amused
      that today I<br/>bought, not a half-crown, but a five<br/>shilling book of stamps.
      I anticip-<br/>ate writing a lot of letters. I wond-<br/>er what they think
      at Pett post-office?<br/>Dandylion's paw must be familiar to<br/>them by now.<br/><br/>I

      let you rest completely. But<br/>I believe letters would be better than<br/>silence.
      Tell me if you think not.<br/>I want to make amends for hurting you.<br/><br/>I
      have had cause to complain that I <br/>have memories of you in too many places<br/>where
      I go often in the course of my<br/>work and relaxation. (Actually I would<br/>not
      have it another way as you know but<br/>you know what I mean.) How, now, shall
      <br/>I be able to go near Studio One with-<br/>out memories of your exquisite
      presence<br/>in your blue dress, and your grey coat<br/>on your shoulders with
      the hood elegant-<br/>ly careless. Oh, you are so beautiful,<br/>and I want
      to tell you my delight at<br/>every gesture and garment and expression.<br/>Never
      doubt, as you say you do, your
