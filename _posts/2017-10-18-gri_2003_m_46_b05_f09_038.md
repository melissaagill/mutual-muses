      THE SEXUAL BASIS OF ART *

      In classical psycho-analysis art was studied for several
      reasons.  Ernst Kris (i) has pointed out that the arts provided
      a field of investigation outside pathology.  It was necessary
      in the first third of the 20c. to establish the ubiquity of
      sexuality in the arts, as in the uncornsious minds of individuals.
      Another point that was emphasized was the relationship between
      an artist's work and his life:  this has been convincingly demon-
      strated in Marie Bonaparte's massive study of Edgar Allen Poe.
      Applied psycho-analysis (with the brilliant exception of Frend's
      Leonardo da Vince (2) has worked better with literature than with
      the visual arts because psycho-analysts tend to have a better
      knowledge of one than the other.  (Ella Sharpe, for example,
      once quoted, with equal respect, Van Gogh and Dame Laura Knight.)
      Recently attempts have been made to study the arts with at-
      tention to specific problems of technique and aesthetics.  Harry
      B. Lee, in uncollected articles (4), for example, has considered
      the psychological distinction between masterpieces and bread-and-
      butter pieces, and the specific nature of creativity.  At pres-
      ent this field is in a fragmentary but evocative condition.  Oft
      people who have not mastered the classical phase of psych-analysts
      acquire a spurious modernity by rejecting the complexitites of re-
      cent research.  Our concern here is not the recent controversial
      refinements but the classical work of psycho-analysis which it is
      irresponsible and prejudiced to reject new.  However, it is my

      THE SEXUAL BASIS OF ART *
      In classical  psycho-analysis art was studied for several
      reasons. Ernst Kris (i) has pointed out that the arts provided
      a field of investigation outside pathology. It was necessary
      in the first third of the 20c. to establish the ubiquity of
      sexuality in the arts, as in the unconscious minds of individuals.
      Another point that was emphasized was the relationship between
      an artist's work and his life: this has been convincingly demon-
      strated in Marie Bonaparte's massive study of Edgar Allen Poe.
      Applied psycho-analysis (with the birlliant exception of Freud's
      Leonardo do Vinci (2). has worked better with literature than with
      the visual arts because psycho-analysts tend to have a better
      knowledge of one than the other. (Ella Sharpe, for example,
      once quoted, with equal respect, Van Gogh and Dame Laura Knight.) (3)
      Recently attempts have been made to study the arts with at-
      tention to specific problems of technique and aesthetics. Harry
      B. Lee, in uncollected articles (4), for example, has considered
      the psychological distinction between masterpieces and bread-and-
      butter pieces, and the specific nature of creativity. At pres-
      ent this field is in a fragmentary but evocative conditon. Often
      people who have not mastered the classical phase of psyco-analysis
      acquire a spurious modernity by rejecting the complexities of re-
      cent research. Our concern here is not the recent controversial
      refinements but the classical work of psycho-analysis which it is
      irresponsible and prejudiced to reject now. However, it is my
      experience that hostile critics are reluctant to consider the psycho-
      logical background of the arts, despite the consequent gain in
