      Mandy has gone back (reluctantly) to Worthing, Home, &
      Digger. Apart from the tension about her that I mentioned,
      I heard of two more symptoms of her unhappiness. On
      occasions she developes at twitch; worse, she had her
      hair done while in town & the hairdresser was shocked
      to find three grey hairs. She's 12. Mollie is down there
      with her at the moment.

      Don't work too hard with your gruests. I keep thinking
      of them as the Squares which is another word for Hicks,
      which means country cousins. Seriously, don't over-
      work to entertain them, please. I hope you enjoy
      their stay: it is certain that they will.

      Perhaps you would ask C. to look up HEP, HEPPED,
      in his complicated thesaurus of slang?

      Dearest heart, I love you dearly, dearly.
      I adore you
      Lawrence

      P.S. You know my poems about rooms, houses.
      Here is a new bit:

      More people than doors
      as in a farce of bedrooms,
      in the cupboard a naked lover
      among the clothes - hangers,
      Twisting his ankle on
      Winter & Summer shoes
      he can't get into.

      It's part of a larger piece called HOUSING
      SHORTAGE or OVERCROWDING or something of
      the kind.
