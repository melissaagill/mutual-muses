      difficulties. Thanks to your splendid
      packing the frames arrives undamaged.
      Everthing was spendidly tidy when
      I got back if a little dusty.
      I joined the "Thumbery" at tea
      with C. and J. but they did not
      stay very long. In the evening I
      fooked over my jewels for the Tate - I did
      not sleep very well at first for I
      missed my Dandy.
      To-day I went to Mr. Marcer's
      to get my seeds - he was most
      welcoming and helpful - and then
      I started filling the excellent trenches
      that Owers has dug for me I have
      nearly completed one and 1/2 the
      other. I have put in some seeds
      and am pleased to see that
      the seed sown at Easter is com-
      ing up. I worked in the
      morning and evening - after tea.

      long. In the evening I looked over my jewels for the f^ete - I did sleep very
      well at first for I missed my Dandy.<br/>To-day I went to Mr. Mercer's to get
      my seeds - he was most welcoming and helpful - and then I started filling the
      excellent trenches that Owers has dug for me I ahve nearly completed one and  1/2  the
      other. I have put in some seeds and am pleased to see that the seed sown at
      Easter is coming up. I worked in the morning and evening - after tea.

      difficulties. Thank to your splendid packing, the frances arrived undamaged.
      Everything was splendidly tidy when I got back, if a little dusty. I joined the "Thumbery" at tea with C. and J. but they did not stay very long. On this evening I looked over my jewels for the fete. I did not sleep very well at first for I missed my Dandy.
      Today I went to Mr [unclear]Mercer's[/unclear] to get my seeds. He was most welcoming and helpful. And then I started filling the excellent trenches that [unclear]Owers[/unclear] has dug for me. I have nearly completed one and 1/2 the other. I have put in some seeds and am pleased to see that the seed sown at Easter is coming up. I worked in the morning and evening, after tea.
