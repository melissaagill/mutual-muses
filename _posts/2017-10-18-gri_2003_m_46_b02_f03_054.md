      Dearest Sylvia:

      I enclose press cuttings about my lecture. The Advertiser is the one of the girl you saw and waved the [unclear]Derdin[/unclear] at - like a matador. Neither is entirely satisfactory as a report but I imagine this third person view of my activities will amuse you as it does me.

      I am going to give the same lecture again tonight to the Redbourn characters that Harpendon has heard already. I am finishing this in the bus to St Albans where I am having dinner before the lecture. I am nearly there so must stop after saying I love you. Lawrence
