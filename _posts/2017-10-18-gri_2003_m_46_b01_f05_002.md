      Thank you for your letter. What a difference it made, as all your letters do, to me. Not that I was melancholy before, but every letter adds something to my impressions of you and endorses my love. I can never regret our love, as you must know, because of our mutual trust. I send you, my dear, a hundred kisses. All that you say about us is perfectly true and I admire - as well as adore - your under-standing.
      Yes, yes, do talk over dates with [unclear]M[/unclear]. How deliciously you explain the at-titude of your owls & how, just as your delicate reproof of Apollo's clumsi-
      ness in questioning them.
