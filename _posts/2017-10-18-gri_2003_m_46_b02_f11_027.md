      What can I do today? The wind is high and the rain is heavy. I am strictly a Bronte character today. I shall go out - just as I am - and walk as Heathcliffe.

      come until Saturday, it gives us under four days, for I suppose you would leave Tuesday morning. In any case I long to see you.
      What can I do today? The wind is high and the rain is heavy. I am strictly a Bronte character today. I shall go out - just as I am - and walk the Heathcliffe.
      What I can do -  and what I shall do most - is think of you, in loving dazzling counterpoing to my mood. I dreamt of you last night and woe full of thoughts of you. I love you
