      2 Leicester, so I imagine that I am not in part one.
       I am sorry J. K. is leaving so soon I hope you enjoyed the dinner - I am sorry Peter is beginning to "show difficult" Still you have stayed with him a week.
      I'm so glad that you went to Notre Dame - and do hope you manage to see the Sainte Chappelle - remember to look at the pavement. I am very much looking foreward to seeing the poems. I 'm sorry to note that you sound a little sad. I expect you will have cheered up again by now - I know my resilient lion!
      I took my picture to Mrs. [unclear]Hake[/unclear] and offered it to her for 3 gne. but she insisted on 4 gne. So I shall buy a pair of shoes - light walking, I need them.
      I had a charming day yesterday for everyone was in such a good mood. Tiny made coffee in the morning - and Clifford was very expansive and in-formative - and we had tea together and a tea-cap at night.
