      4 is you for I feel so very depressed, and in spite of your kind letters not entirely reassured - but that is the unreason of bad health. Tiny is very nice and extremely kind, but I don't think she likes me much at the moment.

         I'm glad you are interested in the Geoffrey it doesn't sound quite your cup of tea - but I don't really know anything about it - it may well be. I think it would be an interesting job - anyway most con-venient! and you could do some lecturing too if you wanted no doubt.

         Do send Paul H. a p.v. card - or rather give me his address and I will for I will make a "beau geste" he can do as he likes! Don't you think? Are you sending to Paul Southey? I haven't his address. I hope Michael will send you envelopes soon, I am so anxious to have everything out on time it is so important otherwise people have other engagements and can't come. You don't say anything about Gainsborough do be sure to get the review at least/ don't leave it to the week before. And please let me have the Vogue letter as soon as you reasonably can because I want to send it off as soon as

      4 is you for I feel so very depressed, and
      in spite of your kind letters not entirely
      reassured - but that is the unreason of
      bad health. Tiny is very nice and
      extremly kind, but I don't think she
      likes me much at the moment.
      I'm glad you are interested in the Geoffrye,
      it doesn't seem quite your cup of tea -
      but I don't really know anything about it -
      it may well be. I think it would be
      an interesting job - anyway most con-
      venent! and you could do some lecturing
      too if you wanted no doubt.
      Do send Paul H. a P.V. card -
      or rather give me his address and
      I will for I will make a "bean seste,
      he can do as he likes! Don't you
      think? Are you sending to Paul Sonthey?
      I haven't his address. I hope Michael
      will send you envelopes soon. I am
      so anxious to have everything out on time
      it is so important other what people
      have other engagements and can't come.
      You don't say anything about Gainsborough,
      do be sure to get the review at least,
      don't leave it to the week before. And
      please let me have the Vogue letter as
      soon as you reasonably can because
