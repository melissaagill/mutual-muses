      NIGHT
      Aubade is soon, where are you
      still in the dark, crazy to wake
      from something papery or soft,
      hungry membrane, coarse sack?

      What do you want to wake to
      except the skin that hoards blood
      as if it were our life's night?

      This is the night's happy ending.
      Despite dreams I know how it ends.

      DAWN'S TIMING IS GOOD
      Bloop of water , its chambered bleep,
      soup on a slope, keeping on night long:
      the eek of planks, creaking down
      the rustle of loose plaster, oh the house

      Sonnets regular as milken pints
      are characteristic of the morning
      which always periods the time
      when sounds were live in the good ear.

      MORNING
      In what the folk said real I look
      for salt and pattern.
      Home truths about the bed and sky,
      the thin to fatten.

      Making the bed, setting the table,
      hands turn into tools.
      The sudden taste of earth in a ripe pear
      sets me digging fools

      Night

      Aubade is soon, where are you
      still in the dark, crazy to wake
      from something papery or soft,
      hungry membrane, coarse sack?

      What do you want to wake to
      except the skin that hoards blood
      as if it were our life's night?

      This is the night's happy ending.
      Despite dreams I know how it ends.

      DAWN'S TIMING IS GOOD

      Bloop of water, its chambered bleep,
      soup on a slope, keeping on night long:
      The [unclear]wek[/unclear] of planks, creaking down
      the rustle of loose planks [unclear]on[/unclear] the  house.

      Sonnets regular as milken pints
      are characteristic of the morning
      which always periods the time
      when sounds were live in the good ear.

      MORNING

      In what the wold said real I look
         for salt and pattern.
      Home truths about the bed and sky,
        the thing to fatten.

      Making the bed, setting the table,
         hands turn into tools.
      The sudden taste of earth in a ripe pear
        set me digging fools.

      NIGHT
      Aubade is soon, where are you
      still in the dark, crazy to wake
      from something papery or soft,
      hungry membrane, coarse sack?

      What do you want to wake to
      except the skin that hoards blood
      as if it were our life's night?

      This is the night's happy ending.
      Despite dreams I know how it ends.

      DAWN'S TIMING IS GOOD
      Bloop of water, its chambered bleep,
      soup on a slope, keeping on night long:
      the [unclear]rek[/unclear] of planks, creaking down
      the rustle of loose plaster, on the house.

      Sonnets regular as milekn pints
      are charicteristics of the morning
      which always periods the time
      when sounds were live in the good ear.

      MORNING
      In what the folk said read I look
      for salt and pattern.
      Home truths about the bed and sky,
      the thin to fatten.

      Making the bed, setting the table,
      hands turn into tools.
      The sudden taste of earth in a rope pear sets me digging fools.

      (...july,1953)
