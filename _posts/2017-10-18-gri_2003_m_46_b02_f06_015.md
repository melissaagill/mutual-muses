      14TH JULY BLACKHEATH

      DEAREST SYLVIA

      I am sorry for the confusion that resulted, if I am not mistaken, in your receiving a letter intended for the Barber Institute.  Let me know if it was that or a letter for Gibson I sent you so that I can send an appropriate apology if one is due to anybody.  Poor old Dandylion, all this letter-writing is too much for him!  He has been busy this morning and has now quite finished his Gainsborough articles and intends to do a short one on the Vienna Tapestries as well today.

      Your registered letter came this morning.  I will go to London tomorrow and get the tea then.  I will send off the tea then or, if I am late, Saturday morning.  You should have it by Monday morning, anyway.

      Yes, I will be delighted to meet you.  Anywhere you wish, at terminius, wayside halt, on the coast.

      Yesterday I had tea with Charles so that's over.  Then in the evening Paul and I went to see Nahum Tate's adaption of King Lear which is really admirable.  For the most part it can taken quite seriously in its Dry-
      denesque character.  There is one funny bit,however, when Regan says to Edmund, after he has betrayed his father, and is simulating great grief:

      There is a grotto in the lower grove
      With privacy to suit a mourner's thoughts.

      Charming is it not

      From the Library I have that splendid new book The Taste of Angels, which is about taste and patronage.  I have also bought a 2nd-hand copy, at half-price, of Roof Bosses in Medieval Churches which was a great find.

      DEAREST SYLVIA
      I am sorry for the confusion that resulted, if I am not mistaken, in your receiving a letter intended for the Barber Institute. Let me know if it was that or a letter for Gibson I sent you so that I can send an appropriate apology if one is due to anybody. Poor old Dandylion, all this letter-writing is too much for him! he has been busy this morning and has now quite finished his Gainsborough articles and intends to do a short one on the Vienna Tapestries as well today.
      Your registered letter came this morning. I will go to London tomorrow and get the tea then. I will send off the tea then or, if I am late, Saturday morning. You should have it by Monday morning, anyway.
      Yes, I will be delighted to meet you. Anywhere you wish, at terminius, wayside halt, on the coast. Anywhere. I await your next news.
      Yesterday I have tea with Charles so that's over. Then in the evening Paul and I went to see Nahum Tate's adaptation of King Lear which is really admirable. For the most part it can be taken quite seriously in its Drydenesque character. There is one funny bit, however, when Regan says to Edmund, after he has betrayed his father, and is simulating great grief:
               There is a grotto in the lower grove
               With privacy to suit a mourner's thoughts.
      Charming is it not?
      From the Library I have that splendid new book The Taste of Angels, which is about taste and patronage. I also have bought a 2nd-hand copy, at half-price, of Roof Bosses in Medieval Churches which was a great find.
