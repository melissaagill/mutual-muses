      Dearest Lawrence,

          I have thought of you so much today - and imagined how delightful you would look in a white cocked hat.  I wonder if you went to see Molly and Ricky to-day.

          This morning we went to the Holbien D Mestre museum and looked carefully at the basket and Bath and the lovely sheets & china.  This afternoon it was dreadfully wet before tea.  I did a small water-color of roses and then we went for a drive and looked at Bath from Beechen Cliffs.

          Sunday.  To-day we hope to go to Wells. Now that petrol is unrationed it is not difficult.

          Tuesday  I have been to Wells since writing - what a lovely
