       My dear Sylvia
        I cannot possibly communicate my rapture this
      morning when I received your letter. Today is the
      8th and by chance your letter was dated the 8th,
      too, so that an effect of magical speed made it-
      self felt at once. The barrier of space dissolved.
      And there was the great sheet, blue behind your blue
      ink written with a soft flexible  line, and yet domin-
      ated by your rose, burning with an intensity almost
      alarming. As I looked I marvelled for until the pale
      elves of the page the [unclear] ley[/unclear] of red is so strong as to defy
      the idea ^ that the rose has been actually painted. You
      have caught so beautifully the farry-velvety feel
      of the dark rose and the sensual folds which yet sug-
      gest weight the hardness of the core. I am so pleased
      that roses have a larger span than I imagined ; it is
      the result of learning about them via Carew. Suck-
      ling, Ronsard.
           Delightful too is your pale, delicate image of Belle
      pink, green , yellow picking up in a different order the main tints
      of our rose. I remember of course the angle of her head
      and the lovely forward movement of her body which you
      have captured perfectly.
          Across the long undulating folds of her dress you wrtie
      that R.C.s are not concerned until death because they are con-
      cerned also with "eternity". But surely that is the importance
      they give death, the moment of transitions: [unclear] wangle[/unclear] catholics
      it is a matter of high importance that an erring member of the family be given the benefit of a priest in his last moments
      fearing that his repentence will otherwise go un-recognized
      by God as well as man. Surely it is you and I who deny any

      8.iv.1948

      My dearest Sylvia,

      I cannot possibly communicate my rapture this morning when I received your letter. Today is the 8th and by change your letter was dated the 8th, too, so that an effect of magical speed made itself felt at once. The barrier of space dissolved. And there was the great sheet, blue behind your blue ink written with a soft flexible line, and yet dominated by your rose, burning with an intensity almost alarming. As I looked I marveled for with the pale blues of the page the key of red is so strong as to defy the idea that the rose has been actually painted. You have caught so beautifully the furry-velvety feel of the dark rose and the sensual folds which yet suggest weight, the hardness of the core. I am so pleased that roses have a longer span than I imagined; it is the result of learning about them via Carew, Suckling, Ronsard.

      Delightful too is your pale, delicate image of Belle pink, green, yellow picking up in a different order the main tints of our rose. I remember of course the angle of her head, and the lonely forward movement of her body which you have captured perfectly.

      Across the long undulating folds of her dress you write that [unclear]R.C.s[/unclear] are not concerned with death because they are concerned also with eternity? But surely this is the importance they give death, the moment of transition: to Waugh's Catholics it is a matter of high importance that an erring member of the family be given the benefit of a priest in his last moments fearing that his repentance will otherwise go unrecognized by God as well as man. Surely it is you and I who deny any importance to death in our (what can I call it?) amiable [unclear]bed-[/unclear]
