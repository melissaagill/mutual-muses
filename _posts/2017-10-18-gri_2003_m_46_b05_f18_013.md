      Rectory Lodge  19-6-52
      Dearest Lawrence,
      I've very little news--a fasin-
      ating "Sarwamee" has come which
      I will send on in a day or two
      if you are not coming.
      I have done 7 figures for the
      "GA" picture and am working
      on the 8th--Princess Juju!
      This evening I am going to the
      Savages--they have some frames for
      me--and on Monda y is the Golden
      on whom I called this morning on
      the way back from the butchers--
      the are bongeouns!  They are always
      making excuses and being bourgeoius
      and austere.  They never have time
      to relax, and never read--as is
      clearly visible in their work.
      I am so disappointed not
