    clean_transcription: 2 I'm glad you liked my poem - though you never mentioned
      it. I very much admire the one of mirrors - "Let nothing happen to you" it is
      delightfully ingenious.<br/>You must tell me about Uncle Clare's lecture - and
      anything horrid about C.J. did he miss the Jardellis?<br/>I'm sorry that the
      Library is closed what a nuisance.<br/>Although you say you love me and miss
      me so much your lack of ambition for either of us is quite appalling - you do
      nothing abput your poems - or that article about the American Impressionists
      - and you just make pence lecturing. It is not enough - remember what Psyche
      did for her love - I don't think you organise your days properly but you are
      always wasting
