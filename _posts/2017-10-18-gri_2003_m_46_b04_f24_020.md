      By the way the N.P.G. has 3 new acquisitions - not very important but very charming, Dorothy Osborne, Lady Temple and Sir William Temple Bart. by Gaspar Netscher painted in 1671 and 1675, respectively and a Victorian portrait by Eduard Magnus of Jenny Lind the singer - perhaps Gainsborough wants something about them.
           I have been rubbing oil into my "Rueller" with wonderful results - the bloom has nearly gone - and the colours are improved - there is certainly some red in the shadow at the side of the nose.
           I do hope that the parties were fun.  i do look forward to hearing about them, and how Paul Harding was!
           I will tell M. of the money at once; as decreed Tiny & C. send their love.
           I love you.  I adore you my Lion. [unclear]herrs [/unclear]Sylvia.
