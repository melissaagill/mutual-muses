      My journey back last night was uneventful - and
      I had plenty of room. But I hated leaving you be-
      hind. I wrote a poem, words for a song, and read
      the Int. Journal of Sex. I will send you the poem
      in my next letter - it is not quite complete.

      I have completed the B'ham papers & shall send
      them off today.
      To my surprise the ICA sent me a cheque for my
      lecture the other day. I saw the Income Tax
      people this morning (I had an appointment) and
      they are willing to go on with a 1 a week at pre-
      sent - so the ICA cheque is very timely.

      Father sent me a note, inviting me to lunch with

      I enjoyed my weekend so much & wish that

      My journey last night was uneventful - and I had plenty of room But I hated leaving you be- hind. I wrote a poem, words for a song, and read the Int. Journal of Sex. I will send you the poem in my next letter - it is not quite complete.

      I have completed the B'ham papers + shall send them off today.

      To my surprise the ICA sent me a cheque for my lecture the other day. I saw the Income Tax people this morning (I had an appointment) and they are willing to go on with a £1 a week and pre-sent - so the ICA cheque is very timely.

      Father sent me a note, inviting me to lunch with him today (so I shan't harm).

      You are always in my thoughts - dearest love. I enjoyed my weekend so much + wish that you had been well. Damn the date! Come to town soon. I love and adore you
      love you
      Lawrence
