      Monday 24/8 Blackheath Dearest Sylvia
      Yesterday went very well. M was tired and so was I (not late nights -
      but poor sleep) so conversation was inconsequential - but charm-
      ing & I enjoyed myself. M & VP got on well, I think: certainly VP
      is being very co-operative. He is going to visit the gallery & make
      a construction especially for the show. In addition he is going to
      have 2 pieces in M's sculpture show.
      In the evening we saw Buster Keaton in The General and The Baloon-
      atic (you saw the latter with M. I remember). It was a varvellous
      programme. Tomorrow, I hope to see Harold ILoyd in Safety Last.

      My syllabus is complete and I can't see any omissions but I am still
      studying it, hoping for insight and a fresh eye.
      Today I am going to Guipels to review the abstract exhibiton. I
      have also to get tomorrow's lecture at the T.G. ready. 18c [unclear][/unclear]
      art: I must find a new angle on this familiar subject.

      I was very interested in M M comparing detective work to unravelling
      story pictures. It is very true. The detctive works with a sum of
      concrete particulars - which is what a Vict. narrative picture is, too.
      I shall most certainly use that.

      The weather here is so better that the weather at Pett, I'm afraid.
      I do hope the Micks are able to get about & are not kept in-
      doors all the time. And - how long are they staying?

      Lion must go to town. Tho' tired - the show must go on. I miss you,
      dearest, I miss you.
      I love love love you
      Lawrence

      Blackheath
      Monday 24/8
      Dearest Sylvia
      Yesterday went very well. M was tired and so was I (not late nights - but poor sleep) so conversation was inconsequential - but charming & I enjoyed myself. M & VP got on well, I think : certainly VP is being very co-operative. He is going to visit the gallery & make a construction especially for the show. In addition he is going to have 2 pieces in M's sculpture show.
      In the evening we saw Buster Keaton in T6 General and T6 Balooratic (you saw the latter with M, I remember). It was a marvellous programme. Tomorrow, I hope to see Harold Lloyd in Safety last.
      My syllabus is complete and I can't see any omissions but I am still studying it, hoping for insight and a fresh eye.
      Today I am going to [unclear][/unclear] to review the abstract exhibition, I have also to get tomorrow's lecture at the T.G. ready. 18c English art: I must find a new angle on this familiar subject.
      I was very interested in MM comparing detective work to [unclear]unnovelling[/unclear] story pictures. It is very fine. The detective works with a sum of concrete particulars - which is what a vict narrative picture is, too. I shall most certainly use that.
      The weather here is no better than the weather at Pett, I'm afraid. I do hope the Hicks are able to get about & are not kept indoors all the time. And - how long are they staying?
      Lion must to town. Tho' tired - the show must go on. I miss you, dearest, I miss you.
      I love love love you
      Lawrence
