      I know how busy you must be, clearing up Pett - what with one thing & another. But you do have a wide circle of friends & acquaintances, now the Woods have gone, to console & distract you to some ex-tent. Could you not, however, find time to do at least a small painting? It would do much to soothe you & help you control your feelings - as it al-ways does. Nothing big or you would worry about completing it - just a small painting of something precious to you - flowers, or the garden?
      How are your nights? I do hope that you are sleeping well. Are you? I am a good one to ask you as I am not sleeping very well, myself.
