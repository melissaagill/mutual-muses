      Dearest Lawrence,
      I love you Thank you so much for your letter and drawings of Lion at play. I'm so glad he won! By the way there are some interesting articles in this month's Burlington which you should not miss.
      I hope you enjoy your tea with Charles tomorrow - and ask him about the N.G. I would be splendid if that would suit you. By the way if you should be in the neighborhood could you look in at the Redfern; and also see if my name be on the catalogue? I should be so obliged - and you won't forget my watercolors will you? I'm so sorry to be such a nuis-
