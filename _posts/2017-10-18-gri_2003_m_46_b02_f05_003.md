      me as a lover as you are with me as a Muse, beguiling, enchanting, dazzling me:

      How can the fountains of my poems dry,
      The glittering effusive jets
      Quiver, subside and bend -
      When I have Sylvia for Muse?

      My muse inventing subjects with each smile,
      Writing my sonnets with your tongue
      while you do breathe and love I can command
      An endless vocabulary of roses.

      This is your gift, your argument for love,
      So even when you hesitate, or fear,
      I show my Muse in attitudes of love
      For you have taught me the belief in love.
      Now may my poems in their [unclear]order [/unclear] be
      An inspiration to my muse, my Love.

      It is not very fine here today: the birds sing but the light is greyish. Is it bright enough at Pett for you to paint? Oh, how I did adore your new paintings, my marvellous creator. I want to write poems fit to stand with them - they are so fine, so living.
      I love you, I love you

      me as a lover as you are with me as a Muse, beguiling, enchanting, dazzling me:
      How can the fountains of my poems dry,
      The glittering effusive jets
      Quiver, subside, and bend-
      When I have Sylvia for Muse?

      My muse inventing subjects with each smile
      Writing my sonnets with your tongue,
      while you do breathe and love I can command
      An endless vocabulary of roses.

      This is your gift, your argument for love,
      So even when you hesitate, or fear,
      I show my Muse in attitudes of love
      For you have taught me the belief in love.

      Now may my poems in their ardor be
      An inspiration to my muse, my Love.

      It is not very fine here today: the birds sing but the light is greyish.  Is it bright enough at Pelt for you to paint? Oh, how I did adore your new paintings, my marvellous creator. I want to write poems fit to stand with them - they are so fine, so living.
      I love you, I love you Lawrence
