      When it is all over - it is such a struggle I almost wish it had never started, and the only person I don't seem to have alienated is Michael - !
      He got all his dislike of it over early.
      Let me have all your news - what lectures have you next week?
      I shall soon be with you again.
      I am being very spoilt, Mrs Morris has sent me eggs and Christmas roses and this morning [unclear]bulbs[/unclear], Hake has sent daffodils apples oranges and grapefruit which she describes as "Pills" and sends her love. So perhaps I'm not so unloved as I feel!
      I do look forward to your new verse - I very much admired the stanzas you sent me, and the Uncle Elegy as far as it had gone.
      I love you, I adore you, my dear one I love you
      Sylvia
      P.S. What no. Commonfield Road are the Smith's please, I will leave you to do the others.
