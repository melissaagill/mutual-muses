      [10-9-52]
      Wednesday
      Dearest Sylvia,
      I was very unhappy to see you go yesterday but that is, in a
      way, unreasonable as our day or two together were unexpected-
      extra. It was wonderful - as it is always wonderful - to see
      you. Oh, how I adore you. I wait impatiently to see you at
      Pett, always remembering the possibility of your coming to town
      before that. I love you dearly.
      I am pretty well today: the glands seem to be diminishing (tho' slowly) and
      my cold - though obvious - is not too bad. I slept rather
      restlessly. How did you sleep my beauty? Well, I do hope.
      I am not in my usual room as that is full of [unclear]Bobs'[/unclear] relics.
      Instead I am in the double-bed in what used to be my sister's
      room. It is softer than the bed in my old room you will be
      glad to hear.
      If the weather permits I may to to the reference library
      and read Antals' Romantic and Classical articles scattered
      in the Burlington (I have only one of them you may remember).
      You may remember Rosemond Tuve's Herbert book, of
      which we read a review. I have it from the library and
      have ready half of it - it is uncommonly interesting. She
      criticises Empson's interpretation of Herbert because the
      ambiguities which he finds there are really ambiguities formed
      in the liturgy, not one poet's creation. What Empson circuit-
      ously detects she argues is manifestly there once we know the
      medieval and Renaissance background. I expect you know
      much of it but it is new and fascinating to a secular lion.
      The weather here is very unpleasant so I expect you will
      be working on Rinaldo and Armida or your Bottles, unless
      it is fine on the coast.
