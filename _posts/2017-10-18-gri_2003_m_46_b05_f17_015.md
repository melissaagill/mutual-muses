      3 They could sit at home of they would.
      Have you finished the poem about
      Lords and ladies in disguise - I should
      so like to read that one.
      I'm sorry that you can't come for the
      weekend - but it can't be helped.
      Let us hope that we can arrange a-
      nother time as well as the fete.
      I will see what my [unclear]Annulate[/unclear] painting
      is like and will show it if it is suitable.
      I could not bring myself to read
      the article on Cocteau - I thought it
      would be too painful - I feel too in-
      volved! Perhaps you will be so king
      as to tell me any points.
      Your [unclear]Netherne[/unclear] visit sounds interesting
      do tell me something of it. How is
      'Athene' going?
      I will read your City poem again -
      I wept last time I read it - that was
      the third time - but I didn't feel very
      strong - I felt also very sad at
      having to wait another week. It
      is the most reasonable thing to do

      3 They could sit at home if they would.
      Have you finished the poem about
      Lords and Ladies in disguise - I should
      so like to read that one.
      I'm sorry that you can't come for the
      weekend - but it can't be helped
      let us hope that we can arrange a-
      nother time as well as the Fête -
      I will see what my Amulate painting
      is like and will show it if it is suitable.
      I could not bring myself to read
      the article on Cocteau - I thought it
      would be too painful - I feel too in-
      volved! Perhaps you will be so kind
      as to tell me any points.
      Your Netherne visit sounds interesting
      do tell me something of it. How is
      'Athene' going?
      i will read your city poem again -
      I wept last time I read it - that was
      the third time - but I didn't feel very
      strong - I also felt very sad at
      having to wait another week. It
      is the most reasonable thng to do
