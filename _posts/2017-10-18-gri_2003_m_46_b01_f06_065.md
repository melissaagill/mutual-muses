    annotation_text: "28th July\n11 Mansel Road\nWimbledon\n\nMy dearest Sylvia,\n\nThank
      you so much for your letter: what a catalogue of delights it was though my first
      impression was simply joy at seeing your handwriting again. I am writing this
      reply immediately and so have not looked at all the buildings you mentioned
      in what architecture books I have but I intend to later this evening: I shall,
      of course, place you in every photogravure foreground. Your account of the Uffizi
      was very poignant: one does respond like that sometimes to so much beauty. As
      you say everything needs a superlative to describe it and I can only respond
      with conventional but heartfelt agreement. Donatello's Judith. Oh, oh. And your
      description of discovering the Annunciata plus Bruneleschi's Hospital is delightful.
      And, thank you, for remembering mannerists for me: I hope to God you manage
      to tell J.C. about them before he lectures at the N.G. on them. I am glad that
      it is not unbearably hot: we have been lucky here incidentally and it was nearly
      ninety today. (N.C. thermometer registered 87 by 2 o'clock.) I liked your choice
      of expression about 'searching out hidden Bronzino's' for that sums up the position
      of mannerism, as well as the hanging of the pictures in galleries. I am interested
      the Uffizi is so good for pictures - I feared it would be rather dark. \n\nI
      have stroked Pablo for you and he gave a delicious shudder, raised his head,
      and then relaxed on the carpet again, purring, and stretching his front paws.
      That is, he thanks you for your kind thought. Molly is still away but Iris says
      she is very well (she is, however, pro-Ricky): she will be back next week. Charles
      has been there quite a bit, taking her her breakfast in bed and arranging the
      tray with great care I understand, also from Iris. I received a dreadful shock
      from Iris: I ought to be immured, I suppose, but after talking about Existentialism
      I asked what she was interested in at present in the same line and she replied
      Telepathy, that one could get into touch (if I have it right and I fear I have)
      with minds like Leonardo's... Did I tell you, despite such disasters as the
      above, she got Distinction in the exam? To visit the N.G. at the moment is to
      imagine oneself back in the Louvre because all the visitors one notices are
      French - all types except for the abominable middle-class which one is spared.
      It is charming so."

As you say everything needs a superlative to describe it and I can only respond with conventional but heartfelt agreement. Donatello's Judith. Oh, oh. And your description of discovering the Annunciata plus Bruneleschi's Hospital is delightful. And, thank you, for remembering mannerists for me: I hope to God you manage to tell J.C. about them before he lectures at the N.G. on them. I am glad that it is not unbearably hot: we have been lucky here incidentally and it was nearly ninety° today. (N.G. themometer registered 87 by 2 o'clock.) I liked your choice of expression about 'searching out hidden Bronzino's' for that sums up the position of mannerism, as well as the hanging of the pictures in galleries. I am interested the Uffizi is so good for pictures - I feared it would be rather dark.

      I have stroked Pablo for you and he gave a delicious shudder, raised his head, and then relaxed on the carpet again, purring, and stretching his front paws.

      description of discovering the Annunciata plus Brunelleschi's embering mannerists
      for me: I hope to God you manage to tell J.C. about them before he lectures
      at the N.G. on them. I am glad that it is not unbearable hot: we have been lucky
      here incidentally and it was nearly ninety° today. (N.G. thermometer registered
      87 by 2 o'clock.) I liked your choice of expression about 'searching out hidden
      Bronzino's' for that sums up the position of mannerism, as well as the hanging
      of the pictures in galleries. I am interested the Uffizi is so good for pictures--I
      feared it would be rather dark.\n\nI have stroked Pablo for you and he gave
      a delicious shudder, raised his head, and then relaxed on the carpet again,
      purring, and stretching his front paws. That is, he thanks you for your kind
      thought. Molly is still away but Iris says she is very well (she is, however,
      pro-Ricky): she will be back next week. Charles has been there quite a bit,
      taking her her breakfast in bed and arranging the tray with great care I understand,
      also from Iris. I received a dreadful shock from Iris: I ought to be immured,
      I suppose, but after talking about Existentialism I asked what she was interested
      in at present in the same line and she replied Telepathy, that one could get
      into touch (if I have it right and I fear I have) with minds like Leonardo's...
      Did I tell you, despite such disasters as the above, she got Distinction on
      the exam? To visit the N.G. at the moment is to imagine oneself back in the
      Louvre because all the visitors one notices are French--all types except for
      the abominable middle-class which one is spared. It is charming so. "

      My dearest Sylvia,

      Thank you so much for your letter: what a cata-
      logue of delights it was though my first impression was simply joy at seeing your handwriting again. I am writing this reply immediately and so have not looked at all the buildings you mentioned in what architecture books I have but I intend to later this evening: I shall, of course, place you in every photogravure foreground. Your account of the Uf-
      fizi was very poignant: one does respond like that sometimes to so much beauty. As you say everything needs a superlative to describe it and I can only re-
      spond with conventional but heartfelt agreement. Donatello's Judith. Oh, oh. And your description of discovering the Annunciata plus Bruneleschi's Hospital is delightful. And, thank you, for rem-
      embering mannerists for me: I hope to God you man-
      age to tell J.C. about them before he lectures at the N.G. on them. I am glad that it is not un-
      bearably hot: we have been lucky here incidentally and it was nearly ninety today. (N.C. thermometer registered 87 by 2 o'clock.) I liked your choice of expression about 'searching out hidden Bronzino's' for that sums up the position of mannerism, as well as the hanging of the pictures in galleries. I am interested the Uffizi is so good for pictures - I feared it would be rather dark.

      I have stroked Pablo for you and he gave a delicious shudder, raised his head, and then relaxed on the carpet again, purring, and stretching his front paws. That is, he thanks you for your kind thought. Molly is still away but Iris says she is very well (she is, however, pro-Ricky): she will be back next week. Charles has been there quite a bit, taking her her breakfast in bed and arranging the tray with great care I understand, also for Iris. I received a dreadful shock from Iris: I ought to be immured, I suppose, but after talking about Existentialism I asked what she was interested in at present in the same line and she replied Telepathy, that one could get in-
      to touch (if I have it right and I fear I have) with minds like Leonardo's... Did I tell you, despite such disasters as the above, she got Distinction in the exam? To visit the N.C. at the moment is to imagine oneself back in the Louvre because all the visitors one notices are French - all types except for the abominable middle-class which one is spared. It is charming so.
