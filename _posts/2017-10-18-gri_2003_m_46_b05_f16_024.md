      Pett  10-4-52

      Dearest Lawrence,
      Thank you for the exciting extract
      from Lion News and Review.  It was
      a very impressive procession I an see.
      This is just a unwonied note to say
      to expect me about 4 o'clock on
      Monday afternoon.  I expect
      to come by care, but if not, as
      it may be sold I shall come by
      train, and may be a little later, but
      I imagine not much.
      In haste, I love you.
      Sylvia
