      Dearest Sylvia
      You must send me, soon, your poem, a la Seurat:
      you seem to have taken it away with you, in one of
      your note-books.  Let me have it when you can, for
      my own poem in this manner if ready to be written.  I
      made an effort last-night which failed and I need your original.  Rarely is a poet so fortunate as
      to have actual poetry by his muse as his model.  I
      would be a boor if I failed to respond.
      I have two tickets for the Courbet lecture but I
      have not obtained one for Blunt's Claude as it is full-
      up, unfortunately.  Disappointed though I am it at
      least spares my having to come up to town on Friday.
      Your suggestion about having Pissarro for the
      Cezanne-Gauguin lecture is very felicitious - a charm-
      ing sleight-of-hand, making a virtue out of careless-
      ness.  I know that your own lecture cannot fail
      to be successful when such elegant resources are
      at your paw-tips.  You say in your letter you are
      apprehensive and though I sympathise I remain un-
      convinced of your in-ability.
      Do you remember the advertisement we read - for Transition?  I have it - and it is a delightful & essential book which will, apart from its integral
      interest, assist my Bourteau lecture with very new pictures & statements by various pointers them-
      selves.  There are, also, some poems which de-
      light this high-poetical lion.

      Blackheath Dearest Sylvia
      You must send me, soon, your poem a la seurat:
      you seem to have taken it away with you, in one of
      your note-books. Let me have it when you can, for
      my own poem in the manner is ready to be written, I
      made an effort last-night which Jarland and I need
      your original. Rarely is a poet so fortunate as
      to have actual poetry, by his muse as his model, I
      would be a [unclear][/unclear] if I failed to respond.
      I have the tickets for the Courlet lecture but I
      have not obtained one for Blunt's Claude as it is full -
      up, unfortunately, Disappointed though I am it at
      least spares my having to come up to town Friday.
      Your suggestions about having Pissarro for the
      [unclear][/unclear] [unclear][/unclear] lecture is very selicitrous - a charm-
      ing Sleigh-of-hand, making a virtue out of careless-
      ness. I know that your own lecture cannot fail
      to be successful when such elegant resources are
      at your paw-tips. You say in your letter you are
      apprehensive and though I sympathise I remain un-
      convienced of your in-ability.
      Do you remember the advertisement we read
      for Transition? I have it - and it is a delightful &
      essential book which will, apart from its integral
      interest, assist my Bourstead lecture with very
      new pictures & statements by various painters them-
      selves. There are also, some poems which de-
      light this high-poetical lion.
