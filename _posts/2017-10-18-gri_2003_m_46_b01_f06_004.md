      Tuesday
      Dearest Sylvia,
      Thank you for your [unclear]letter[/unclear] which arrived this morning. Please, do not be unhappy about Friday, because it is no exaggeration to say that simply your presence is a delight. I miss you so much. When you said in your letter "I have to go to Tharps's" I felt a [unclear][/unclear] of nostalgia, remembering  our walks there. Oh, Sylvia, I treasure all our [unclear][/unclear] together; as passionately as you have reserved souvenirs of your past my memory keeps your image in thousands of roses. At last I am WIMbeldon 1967 11 Mansel Road, Wimbledon, S.W.19 6-7-48
