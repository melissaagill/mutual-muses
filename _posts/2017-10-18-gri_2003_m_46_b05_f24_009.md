      don't think he would have admitted that a little while ago! I was talking to
      him about your Hogarth, and he said that the worst of an old established firm
      like Hodders is that they were in no hurry to add to their lists as these were
      long enough already - and they could keep one waiting for anything form 8 months
      to 3 years. He said was there another book on the subject being written, and
      when I said, yes, he suggested that you should write and tell them for that
      would hurry them up - Have you been to see them yet? He is going to put his
      agent in touch with you, I think.
