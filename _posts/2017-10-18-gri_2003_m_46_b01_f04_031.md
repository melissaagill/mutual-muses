      I should think that you've got the rain you wanted for the garden now. It has been raining steadily since dawn.
      I have been thinking today - as on many days - how fortunate I am to have your love. I don't think I can really put down how much it means to have you loving me. I feel my eyes water sometimes at the thought of it and other times I sort of stretch voluptuously and smile. I love you and as you have shown me am happy even when we are separated because I know it is not irrevocable and that you think of me, love me. O my dearest Sylvia, I love you. Only a great hug and many kisses and looks could express what I feel now, my lover.
      ........
      What can I say after that? It would be unfair of me not to say how much I appreciated Prof. [unclear][/unclear]Scusifanto's examination paper. Question III is grandly comic and I like the implication of 'Describe [unclear][/unclear] shortly'...
      It is very good news to Dandylion that you are quite well again. He looks up from the examination paper which he is studying and gives a lovely smile at the thought of you. He starts to write about 'green grass' in his ecstacy though he is supposed to be analysing the buttresses and corbels of [unclear][/unclear] olives lodge.

      I should think that you've got the rain you wanted for the garden now. It has been raining steadily since dawn.
      I have been thinking today - as on many days - how fortunate I am to have your love. I don't think I can really put down how much it means to have you loving me. I feel my eyes water sometimes at the thought of it and other times I sort of stretch voluptuorously and smile. I love you and as you have shown me am happy even when we are separated because I know it is not irrevocable and that you think of me, love me, O my dearest Sylvia, I love you. Only a great hug and many kisses and looks would express what I feel now, my lover.

      .... ....
      What can I say after that? It would be unfair of me not say how much I appreciated Prof. [unclear]Szsifartos'[/unclear] examination  paper. Question III is grandly comic and I like the implication of 'Describe shortly' ....
      It is very good news to Dandylion that you are quite well again. He looks up from the examination paper which he is studying and gives a lovely smile at the thought of you. He starts to write about 'green grass' in his ectasy though he is supposed to be analysing the buttresses and corbels of [unclear]alines [/unclear]lodge.
      I accept your correction of my theory about yours and Janette Day's hair but I say again that she  reminded of you and that this increased my enjoyment of the film.
