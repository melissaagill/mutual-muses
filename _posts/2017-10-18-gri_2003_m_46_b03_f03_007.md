      3 march 50

      Dearest Sylvia,

      Here is a copy of World Review which came this morning which I hope you will show to the Woods for they thought of the Christian symbolism. Many of the other symbols you detected and, if it were possible in such a short article, I would give you all acknowledgements. Last week I received ten guineas for the Third Man and it is this that has kept your lion's head above water:

      (I did not expect, by the way, ever to be in a paper with Jaspers...)

      I envy you your lecture on Heredity by Clifford, just as I envy C. having so intelligent and beautiful a cat in his audience.

      Yesterday evening, after all the lectures &c. of which I told you yesterday I went to Paul's flat which is charming and met various hat-designing or theatrical queers - one of whom I settled down to talk about Venice with. He had lived on S. Giorgio Maggiore! I caught the last train and was very tired last night but I am fine today and shall settle down this afternoon and evening to psycho-analyse H's aesthetics in relation to the fore-pleasure of his pictures.

      I must go and shop or half the day will be gone.

      I love you and will write again tomorrow, my beauty, my dove. I hope you are better today. Look after yourself; Lionel sends his warmest regards and Dandy has passionate love,
      I love you Lawrence
