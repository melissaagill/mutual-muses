      Wimbledon 16 IX 52
      Clifford has just phoned here and we have arranged to have tea at the Tate Gallery together this afternoon. The reason he found me here is this.
      When my glands swelled up again I though it time to see a Doctor: my parents agreed and, of course, the only Dr. I know is at Wimbledon - Dr Reader. He examined me thoroughly and was uncertain what it was wrong with me - and ordered a blood test. That was Saturday. I couldn't have the blood test until Monday and he did not hear the result until today: it is perfectly normal as to white corpuscles which means i have not got glandular fever. He said it seems to be an 'ordinary infection': I can 'carry on' and
