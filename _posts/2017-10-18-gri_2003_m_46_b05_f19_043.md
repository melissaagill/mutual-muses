      2 The little [unclear] nudes [/unclear] are only a factor short of the little frames - I can easily put in a match stick or some such at the bottom - I will tone down the shadows in the female, and frame the male! I showed these to Tiny and Clifford who liked them. They very much admired the Roses, and the water colour - but Tiny dislikes very much my self-portrait - says its not a bit like me - says it looks like Audrey! - I say don't you think it nicely painted but she isn't interested in that she says as she knows nothing about it!
      Tiny is very gloomy, I have been trying to cheer her up. I think I shall go to Canterbury after all. Clifford is going to town to see Haire who wants him to do the journal for [unclear] August [/unclear] as he is far

    clean_transcription: The little nudes are only a fraction<br/>short of the little
      frames - I can easily<br/>put in a match stick or some such<br/>at the bottom.
      I will tone down<br/>the shadows in the female, and frame<br/>the male! I showed
      these to Tony and <br/>Clifford who like them. They very<br/>much admired the
      Roses and the<br/>water colour - but Tiny dislikes<br/>very much my self-portrait
      -<br/>says it's not a bit like me - says<br/>it looks like Audrey! - I say<br/>don't

      as she knows nothing<br/>about it!<br/>Tiny is very gloomy. I have been<br/>trying
      to cheer her up. I think<br/>I shall go to Canterbury after all -<br/>Clifford
      is going to town to see<br/>Haire who wants him to do the<br/>journal for August
