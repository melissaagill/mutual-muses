      Wimbledon 4th April

      Dearest Sylvia -

      It was a pleasure to find, on reach-
      ing Wimbledon, a letter from you.
      I was deeply delighted to be compli-
      mented in the two roles in which I most
      wish to please - lover and poet.
      Alas, however, that you had not [unclear]favies[/unclear]
      news about seeing your Dandylion.
      When, I wonder, will I see you? Your
      stay in Londen, after the 14th, will,
      I fear, not help your lion very
      much. Oh, you must see me soon!
      I love you.
      May I hope that you will come to
      Italy? If so I must learn some words
      in that musical tongue, write to my
