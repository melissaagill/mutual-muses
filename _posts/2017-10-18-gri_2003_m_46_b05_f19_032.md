      Sunday Clifford came back rather gloom
      in preparation for Sunday, but
      I managed to cheer him up
      before long and asked him of
      his doings--he seems to have
      had a very good time eating
      drinking and bathing--and Parham
      House looks delightful with
      some very interesting portraits.  I
      should like to see it, but there
      is a very good "country life"
      brochure.
      I will try to get hold of the
      "New Yorkers" for you.  I will
      call tomorrow moring.  This
      afternoon I am going to visit
      Nora Riesco, but I shall paint

      came back rather gloomy in preparation for Sunday, but I managed to cheer him
      up before long and asked him of his doings - he seems to have had a very good
      time eating drinking and bathing - and Parham House looks delightful with some
      very interesting portraits - I should like to see it, but there is a very good
      "Country Life" brochure.<br/>I will try to get hold of the "New Yorker" for
