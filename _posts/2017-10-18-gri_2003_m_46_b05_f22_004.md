      3    small champagne.  I think before
      I finish the paper I will put in
      the wall and fireplace, it will
      help to "establish the tone" as
      they say!  I shall do that in a
      minute or two.  The white liquid
      white its billowing Barque paper
      is like Raphaeli Sistine Madonaa
      I think.
      Thursday:  Dear love, I missed you
      so last evening, and felt that I had
      not kissed and embarassed you nearly
      enough.  I adore you--look
      after yourself and keep well I'm
      so glad that you can come again
      soon.  I will feed you up
      and look after you--thank you
      so much for looking after me.
      I am writing this on the couch
      in the studio.  I feel much better
      today.  I slept beautifully--curled
      up in my memories of you.
      When Tiny and her mother came
      back from Knoll they called me
      in for a glass of sherry; Tiny was
      very sweet, and we supped together.
      I think her neck has been very
