      6-2-53 Rectory Lodge Pett Hasting's Dearest Lawrence,
      I begin at last to loose my
      cold, though I feel dreadfully tired
      and slept until 5 o'clock. I hope that
      I sleep better to-day. I hope you
      are well and not over tired with all
      your lecturing. I hope you are more
      pleased this time with your Matisse.
      What did you lecture on at Banstead?
      How many people managed to come
      to the Wallace collection? Clifford
      said that if he could he would go
      to one of your lectures on Thursday or
      to-day. I wonder if he will!
      I don't suppose theres any hope
      now for the "portrait of the artist
      but in case there is here is the
      little painting which I think very
      good and have modified a little
      and believe it to be. More like me

      N. Hastings

      Dearest Lawrence,
      I begin at last to lose my cold, though I feel dreadfully tired and slept so badly last night that I read until 5 o'clock. I hope that I sleep better today. I hope you are well and not over tired with all your lecturing. I hope you are more pleased this time with your Matisse. What did you lecture on at Bamstead? How many people managed to come to the Wallace Collection? Clifford said that if he could he would go to one of your lectures on Thursday or Friday. I  wonder if he will!
      I don't suppose there's any hope now for the "Portrait of the artist" but in case there is here is the little painting which I think very good and I have modified a little and believe it to be more like me.
