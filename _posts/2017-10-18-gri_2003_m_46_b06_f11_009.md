      Blackheath
      9 November

      Dearest Sylvia:

      I have just read your letters on [unclear]South's[/unclear] most carefully. I notice that he says you could not expect more than 1500 from the Trustees (probably less). That means Georgie's 1000 (almost all of it) would go on the purchase [unclear]or[/unclear] 46. Therefore we would not have enough for immediate repairs (estimated at 600-700). I have worked out more sums, and I am not hopeful unless the owner will accept 2000 for the house. I will make that offer today: it must our top price. If Foster & Foster are interested in that I will ask their advice about a builder's free estimate - but not until then.

      I hate the thought of not getting the house, and me still [unclear] away[/unclear]. But it is a house - only one house among hundreds - not a symbol - as I am reconciling myself to the possibility of finding somewhere else, if need be. You should, too, I think. Victor [unclear]Pasmore[/unclear] suggests we look in Greenwich: the parts of it are nasty, the nice parts are excellent. He points out it is cheaper than Blackheath/ That is a lead, I think. The Lewisham side of the Heath is another possibility.

      I have to shave, prepare my lecture, and go to town. I will add the results of my interview with F & F to this letter.

      9 November Blackheath Dearest Sylvia:
      I have read your letter & South's most carefully. I notice
      that he says you could not expect more than 1500 from the
      Trustees (probably less). That means Georgie's 1000 (almost all
      of it) would go on the purchase of 46. Therefore we would not
      have enough for immediate repairs (estimated at 600-700).
      I have worked out more sums, and I am not hopeful unless
      the owner will accept 2000 for the house. I will make that
      offer today: it must be our top price. If Foster & Foster
      are interested in that I will ask their advice about a build-
      er's free estimate - but not until then.

      I hate the thought of not getting the house, and we still may.
      But it is a house - only one house among hundreds - not a
      symbol - so I am reconciling myself to the possibility of
      finding somewhere else, if need be. You should, too, I
      think. Victor Pasmore suggest we look in Greenwich:
      tho' parts of it are nasty, the nice parts are excellent.
      He points out it is cheaper than Blackheath. That is a
      lead I think. The Lewisham side of the Heath is another
      possibility.

      I have to shave, prepare my lecture, and go to town.
      I will add the results of my interview with F&F to this
      letter.
