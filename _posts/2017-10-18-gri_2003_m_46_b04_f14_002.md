      2. one! Poor cat she would have liked a pearl necklace! But it may be pretty - let's hope so.
       The Great Gatsby whiled away some of my time in the 'bus - I am enjoying it very much. I hope you managed to get what you wanted from the V. & A. By the way - do buy a strong hot-water-bottle the price of rubber has rocketed - and if you can get a suit do if you only start one for wool is getting more and more expensive - I shall get some stuff myself! and another pair of shoes for prices are rising I understand. Why not talk to your father about it?
       Clifford and Marjorie came home on the 1.30 'bus and I gave your messages. Marjorie

      32.    one!  Poor cat she would have

      "The Great Gatsby" whiled away
      some of my time in the bus.  I
      am enjoying it very much.  I hope
      you managed to get what you
      wanted from the VA.  By the
      way,  do buy a strong hot
      water bottle the price of rubber
      has rockered, and if you can
      get a suit do if you only
      start one for wool is getting more
      and more expensive.  I shall
      get some stuff myself!  and
