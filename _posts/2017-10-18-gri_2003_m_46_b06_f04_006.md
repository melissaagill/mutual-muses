      Good Friday
      Dearest Sylvia:

      yesterday, though two ladies left at
      one point, for moral reasons, I think.

      ble film, but Garbo was great. (I
      left after two and a half hours!)
      This morning I have written something
      about Turnbull for the sculpture art-
      icle and soon must have some lunch,
      it being 1.45.  (For elevenses I had
      one of those delightful chocolate men
      and thought of you very hard.)  This
      evening I have to see the Cordells
      and John:  I won't forget about your
      portrait of Magda.
      It is good having Ajax and the Poet
      back here and I love The Tyre Furnace.

      [3-4-53]
      Blackheath
      Good Friday
      Dearest Sylvia:
      The Lautrec lecture went pleasantly yesterday, though two ladies left at one point, for moral reasons, I think. Afterwards I looked at the Siqueiros paintings again, meeting, inevitably, Robert. Last night I saw Greta Garbo in The Atonement of Gosta Berling (Swedish, 1923): it was a terrible film, but Garbo was great. (I left after two and a half hours!)
      This morning I have written something about Turnbull for the sculpture article and soon must have some lunch, it being 1.45. (For elevenses I had one of those delightful chocolate men and thought of you very hard.) This evening I have to see the Cordells and John: I won't forget about your portrait of Magda.
      It is good having Ajax and the Poet back here and I love The Tyre Furnace.
      I talked the flower painting over with Mother and as I expected she does not want a very big one. 18 x 16 is the kind of size she would prefer. As to flowers, that she leaves to you: she would prefer 'pinks and petunia colors' rather than 'reds and yellows' on account of her new covers in the drawing room. It irritates her if one of the flowers or a petal has fallen down.

      Blackheath
      Good Friday

      Dearest Sylvia:

      The Lautrec lecture went pleasantly
      yesterday, though two ladies left at
      one point, for moral reasons, I think.
      Afterwards I looked at the Siqueiros
      paintings again, meetings, inevitably,
      Robert. last night I saw Greta
      Garbo in The Atonement of Gosta Berl-
      ing (Swedish, 1923): it was a terri-
      ble film, but Garbo was great. (i
      left after two and a half hours!)

      This morning I have written something
      about Turnbull for the sculpture art-
      icle and soon must have some lunch,
      it being 1.45. (For elevenses I had
      one of those delightful chocolate men
      and thought of you very hard.) This
      evening I have to see the Cordells
      and John: I won't forget about your
      portrait of Magda.

      It is good having Ajax and the Poet
      back here and I love The Tyre Furnace.

      I talked the flower painting over with
      Mother and as I expected she does not
      want a very big one. 18 x 16 is the
      kind of size she would prefer. As to
      flowers, that she leaves to you: she
      would rather prefer 'pinks and petunia colors'
      rather than 'reds and yellows' on ac-
      count of her new covers in the drawing
      room. It irritates her if one of the
      flowers or a petal has fallen down.
