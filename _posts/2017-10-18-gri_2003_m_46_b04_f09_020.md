      Aristotelian quotrains
      Who do I imitate when I address
      The man in the moon or the female stars,
      Moss on a leg, lace of a monolith?
      Who do I imitate except chaotic love.

      The tableau vivant in the glacier
      Edges into Europe carrying
      The sabre-toothed tiger and murdered head.
      Who do I imitate except the past.

      When the alphabet of objects spells
      Roses in all shadows and all lights,
      In chimneys, basins, paths, and landings
      Who do I imitate except desire.

      When I beat time to silent music
      Who do I imitate except myself
      Without whose ardour, could I imitate
      Minervan statues on this North, this rock?

      For An Aunt
      Today being Sunday, your guest a gardener,
      I check the floral zodiac
      In whose favours the country day ripens,
      But query if your herbals are the same.

      Has she seen the lacerated tulips
      Bleed perfume for the senses,
      Christened the white profile of clematis
      Spindly on the rough wall of the night?

      What associations have the roses:
      Are they mouths the hermits fed,
      Does she reckon leaves as quims and mushrooms
      As phallic heads of fertile buried fellows?

      The Poet
      The paper - like a girl
      On a sheet, white bowl
      Where a rose lies - waits
      For ink, or substitutes.

      I question the sail -
      A thoughtful mate.
      The craft is becalmed
      Like a paperweight.

      Aristotelian quotrains
      Who do I imitate when I address
      The man in the moon or the female stars,
      Moss on a leg, lave of a monolith?
      Who do I imitate except chaotic love.

      The tableau vivant in the glacier
      Edges into Europe carrying
      The sabre-toothed tiger and murdered head.
      Who do I imitate except the past.

      When the alphabet of objects spells
      Roses in all shadows and all lights,
      In chimneys, basins, paths, and landigs,
      Who do I imitate except desire.

      When I beat time to silent music
      Who do I imitate except myself
      Whitout whose ardour, could I imitate
      Minervan statues on this North, this rock?

      For An Aunt
      Today being Sunday, your guest a gardener,
      I check the floral zodiac
      In whose flavours the country day ripens,
      But query if your herbals are the same.

      Has she seen the lacerated tulips
      Bleed perfume for the senses,
      Christend the white profile of chlomatis
      Spindly on the rough wall of the night?

      What associations have the roses:
      Are they mouths the hermits fed,
      Does she reckon leaves as quims and mushrooms
      As phallic heafs of fertile buried fellows?

      The Poet
      The paper - like a girl
      On a sheet, white bowl
      Where a rose lies - waits
      For ink, or substitutes.

      I question the sail -
      A thoughtful mate.
      The craft is becalmed
      Like a paperwight.
