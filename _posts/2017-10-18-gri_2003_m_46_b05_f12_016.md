      It is sweet of George & Beryl to be so nice about me. I really must write George a letter. Would you send me his address please?

      Well it must be about 10:00 and I shall go to bed and read the New Yorker. I bought some old ones for 6[unclear]D[/unclear]! One of them has an essay by Thacher about T6 [unclear]Cerchtaud[/unclear] Party. I will finish this tomorrow. For the moment my love, good night. I love you so. Good night.

      Sunday Morning

      Good morning, dearest love. How are you today? I wish I could hear your answer today, now; I wish you were here with me. This time next week you will be, my darling, and that consoles me.

      The jog is perhaps a little milder this morning but only a very little. I can make out the silhouette of the holly tree - but only just.

      Since I wrote the True [unclear]Heart[/unclear] [unclear]Suzie[/unclear] critique I have written a little more about [unclear]heelcahe[/unclear] a copy of which I also enclose. I hope all this will go & [unclear]rost[/unclear] for 2 1/2!

      I love you,

      I do think your party is a ice idea. I look forward to it very much, my darling. Do not worry too much about the private view - I think it will be attended alright. But I am pleased about the party anyway, you know what lions are!
      It is sweet of George & Beryl to be so nice about me. I really must write George a letter. Would you send me his address please.
      Well it must be about 10.00 and I shall go to bed and read the New Yorker. I bought some old ones for 6D!
      One of them has an essay by Thusher about The Cocktail Party. I will finish this tomorrow. For the moment my love, good night. I love you so. Good night.
      Sunday morning
      Good morning, dearest love. How are you today? I wish I could hear your answer today, now; I wish you were here with me. This time next week you will be, my darling, and that consoles me.
      The fog is perhaps a little milder this morning but only a very little. I can make out the silhouette of the holly tree - but only just.
      Since I wrote the True Heart Susie critique I have written a little more about [unclear]'heelcake'[/unclear] a copy of which I also enclose. I hope all this will go &  [unclear]rest[/unclear] for 2 1/2 !
      I love you so much - I adore adore you
      Love you
      Lawrence
