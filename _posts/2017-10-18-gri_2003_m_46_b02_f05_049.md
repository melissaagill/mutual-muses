      it - tell Clifford, do. Give Marjorie and him my love.

      A MAY POEM:

      May is the blue flat sea
      Beneath a blue flat sky
      And the economical line
      Of beaches round the coast,
      The dance of silver-gold
      Medals in the waves
      And clouds no bigger than
      A beauty's art-full patch.

      Now the complexities
      Of spring are at their height:-
      The forests are a mass
      Of anticipated leaves,
      But soon the summer must [unclear]reduce[/unclear]
      Perplexing multitudes of leaf
      To the images of trees,
      Then the trees to the wood.

      Oh May our summer be
      As simple as the sky
      Above the simple sea,
      As loving as the sun
