      16 ix 1950

      Dearest Slyvia,

      Thank you, dearest love, for your birthday painting which is ravishing and has given me already, in the few hours since I opened your letters, more pleasure than many people can receive from a painting in months. The delightful play of shapes between the garland, the flattened discs of the roses pointing in different ways; the ravishing precision of the fruit and in particular the texture of the lovely pair, and the entirely delightful owl... Oh my love, thank you for this delicious sensuous emblem. How delightful is your invention of the signature.

      Give Owlina and Wolina, the darlings, my and a great kiss each for their charming card, so antique in all the ways I delight in. I think I must write some more rose poems. Thank you so much for sending me the charming edition of Milton. All three parcels came this morning, first post, so you could imagine how spoiled I felt. The Milton has been fruitful: I read some of the baroque odes at the end of the boo, beyond the epics, and immediately wrote the Elegy for Mrs Esdaile which we mentioned some time ago, which I enclose. What a felicitous choice was the poet - though I am sure any poet you sent me would be inspiring.

      I shall certainly meet you at Lewisham on Tuesday at the usual time, or at any time you name subsequently in a telegram. I long to meet you again and I love you dearly, my rose, my beauty, my superb painter, my only love.

      I adore you
      Lawrence

    annotation_text: "Blackheath\n16 ix 1950\n\nDearest Sylvia,\nThank you, dearest
      love, for your birthday painting which is ravishing and has given me already,
      in the few hours since I opened your letters, more pleasure than many people
      can receive from a painting in months. The delightful play of shapes between
      the garland, the flattened discs of the roses pointing in different ways; the
      ravishing precision of the fruit and in particular the texture of the lovely
      pear, and the entirely delightful owl… Oh my love, thank you for this delicious
      sensuous emblem. How delightful is your invention of the signature.\nGive Owlina
      and Wolina, the darlings, my love and a great kiss each for their charming card,
      so antique in all the ways I most delight in. I think I must write some more
      roses poems. Thank you so much for sending me the charming edition of Milton.
      All three parcels came this morning, first post, so you can imagine how spoilt
      I felt. The Milton has already been fruitful: I read some of the baroque odes
      at the end of the book, beyond the epics, and immediately wrote the Elegy for
      Mrs Esdaile which we mentioned some time ago, which I enclose. What a felicitous
      choice was that poet – though I am sure any poet you sent me would be inspiring.
      \nI shall certainly meet you at Levisham on Tuesday at the usual time, or at
      any time you may name subsequently in a telegram. I long to meet you again and
      I love you dearly, my rose, my beauty, my superb painter, my only love. \nI
      adore you\nLawrence\n"

      Blackheath
      16 ix 1950
      Dearest Sylvia
      Thank you, dearest love, for your birthday paint-ing which is ravishing and has given me already, in the the few hours since I opened your letters, more pleasure than many people can receive from a paint-ing in months. The delightful play of shapes be-tween the garland, the flattened discs of the roses pointing in different ways; the ravishing precision of the fruit, and in particular the texture of the lovely pear, and the entirely delightful owl... Oh my love, thank you for this delicious sensuous emblem. How delightful is your invention of the signature.
      Give Owlina and Wolina, the darlings, my love and a great kiss each for the charming card, so anti-que in all ways I most delight in. I think I must wright some more roses poems.  Thank you so much for sending me the charming edition of Milton. All three parcels came this morning, first post, so you can imagine how spoiled I felt.  The Milton has already been fruitful: I read some of the baroque odes at the end of the book, beyond the epics, and immediately wrote the Elegy for Mrs Esdaile which we mentioned some time ago, which I enclose.  What a felicitious choice was that poet - though I am sure any poet you sent me would be inspiring.
      I shall certainly meet you at Lewisham on Tuesday at the usual time, or at any time you may name subse-quently  in a telegram. I long to meet you again and I love you dearly, my rose, my beauty, my superb paint-er, m only love.
      I adore you
      Lawrence
