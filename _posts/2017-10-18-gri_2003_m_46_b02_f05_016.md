      Blackheath      13th May 1949

      My dearest Sylvia,

      I wish I could say adequately on paper just how much you mean to me and how I long to the opportunity to prove in speech and act - as in poem and desire - my love for you.  Do not be fearful, dearest, I love you and will look after you.  The weight of decision, of labyrinthine complexity, will be lightened, my rose.  Our life will be conducted so that you have the maximum time to paint.  Love and Art, the only real values, will both be realised by us.

      As the time closes between now and the 22nd I know it will be terribly difficult for you but be consoled by our love.  I love you so much.  If you wish to see me you know you have only to tell me when and I will come immediately to Hastings.  Remember that, if you need me, however suddenly, in the next ten days.  I think of you all the time and love you unceasingly day and night.

      I enquired about a 4-foot divan and the price is about what you said it would be.  I shall still look round for a comfortable second-hand one just a bit longer.  I am delighted that you bought the sauce-boat - what a happy find.  Do, if you discover any other
