      Wednesday
      Dearest Sylvia
         I was s sorry to leave before the departure of the train yesterday and after the lecture I was very concerned at the thought of your arrival in Hastings with all those very heavy parcels and bags!  I do hope you managed them without anxiety or discomfort.  What great resolution on your part it does show.  (Effete lion marvels.)
         The weather does not seem to have broken as we feared so I hope that you enjoy being back at Pett with your garden and the country in Spring.  I hope the wind has not greatly ruffled the blossoms in the orchard:  the trees in Blackheath are mostly alright I noticed this morning.
         Mother, although fibrositis (spelling?) has followed her rash, gave me a very nice dinner last night:  ham, hard-boiled eggs, cucumber, tomatoes, lettuce, beetroot, new potatoes and no less that 3 kinds of home-made tarts.  Apparently Paul has rung Wimbledon to attempt to contact me:  I will try and see him soon & let you know any news about the joint exhibition from Paul's side.
         I slept very badly.  I read that PMLA article about Gray's elegy and put the light out about 12.30.  Such a restless night was my lot, however, that I finally got up at 6.30!  Lion misses his cat as you can see.
         My lecture was well-attended - about 40 people and lots of applause.  However I was not myself entirely satisfied:  it was not quite coherent in form, I thought.  The liseuse distraite, by the way is 1919 (painted at Nice) and La Foret ca 1916 - both much earlier than we thought.
         This morning I have been looking over what I have read in Moby Dick preparatory to picking up where I left off.  Such is Melville's power I found I reread several passages closely.

      [23-4-52]
      Wednesday
      Dearest Sylvia
      I was so sorry to leave before the departure of the train yesterday
      and after the lecture I was very concerned at the thought of your ar-
      rival in Hastings with all those very heavy parcels and bags. I do
      hope you managed then [unclear]without[/unclear] anxiety or discomfort. What great
      resolution on your part it does show. (Effete lion Marvels.)
      The weather does not seem to have broken as we feared so I
      hope that you enjoy being back at pelt with your garden and the
      country in Spring.
      I hope the wind has not greatly ruffled the
      blossom in the orchard: the trees in Blackheath are [unclear]mostly[/unclear] al-
      right I noticed this morning.
      [unclear]Walter[/unclear], although fibrositis (spelling?) has followed his rash, gave
      me a very nice dinner last night: ham, hard-boiled eggs, [unclear]cuc-
      umber[/unclear], tomatoes, lettuce, beetroot, new potatoes and no less than
      3 kinds of home-made tarts. Apparently Paul has rang [unclear]Wim -
      Bledon[/unclear] to attempt to contact me: I will try and see him soon [unclear]and[/unclear] let
      you know any news about the joint-exhibition from Paul's side.
      I slept very badly. I read that PMLA article about Gray's elegy
      and put the light out about 12.30. Sush a restless night was my
      lot, however, that I finally got up at 6.30! Lion misses his cat as
      you can see.
      My lecture was well-attended - about 40 people and lots of
      applause. However I was not myself entirely satisfied: it was
      not quite coherent in form, I thought. The Liseuse Distraite, by the
      way, is 1919 (painted at Nice) and la Foret ca 1916 - both much earlier than we thought.
      This morning I have been looking over what I have read in
      Moby Dick preparatory to picking up where I left off. Such is Melville's
      power I found I reread several passages closely.

      I was so sorry to leave before the departure of the train yesterday and after the lecture I was very concerned at the thought of your arrival in Hastings with all those very heavy parcels and bags.

      The weather does not seem to have broken as we feared so I hope that your enjoy being back at Pett with your garden and the country in Spring. I hope the wind has not greatly ruffled the blossom in the orchard: the trees in Blackheath are mostly alright I noticed this morning.
      Mother, although fibrositis (spelling?) has followed her rash, gave me a very nice dinner last night: ham, hard-boiled eggs, cucumber, tomatoes, lettuce, beetroot, new potatoes and not less than 3 kinds of home-made tarts. Apparently Paul has rung Wimbledon to attempt to contact me: I will try and see him soon let you know any news about the joint-exhibition from Paul's side.
      I selpt very badly. I read the PMLA article about Gray's elegy and put the light our about 12.30. Such a restless night was my lot, however, that I finally got up at 6.30! Lion misses his cat as you can see.
