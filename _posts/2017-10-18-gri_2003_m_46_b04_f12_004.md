      Blackheath
      2 December 1951

      Dearest Sylvia
      I am glad to hear that your painting is going so well and I long to see it, as well as other works I have not yet seen. I am sorry to hear you cannot obtain the canvases easily for your future paintings: if necessary, I shall be glad to get them for you. However as no telegram has come I suppose it has worked out alright. What a relief that [unclear][/unclear] has at last, as the [unclear]friends[/unclear] say, disappeared. Should [unclear]Hetz[/unclear] wear his black [unclear]nails[/unclear], do you think, and [unclear]Tawolla[/unclear] his black mask rather than any of his coloured ones?
      Here is Sylvia [unclear]Bathing[/unclear], finished at last: the 5 [unclear]strangers [/unclear]are one for each sense, ending up with touch. The idea for it came from a neo-platonic poem of Chapman in which he imagines Ovid spying on the Emperor's daughter (or was it niece?) in his baths and thus intoxicating each sense in turn - ending with spiritual love, but only after the other kind has been satisfied.
      I went to Kensington yesterday but uselessly for apparently the collecting days are next Tuesday and Wednesday: it was the last day and there were 9 or 10 people there, taking considerable interest in all pictures. So I could not take your pieces away. However, as I was in town I went to a lecture at the N.P.G. on Victorian prime ministers: the subject for yesterday was Lord Robert Cecil, or Salisbury as he was later known as.

      am glad to hear that your painting is going so well and I long to see it, as
      well as other works I have not yet seen. I am sorry to hear M cannot obtain
      the canvases easily for your future paintings: if necessary, I shall be glad
      to get them for you. However as no telegram has come I suppose it has worked
      out alright. <br/>What a relief that Doris has at least, as the French say,
      dis-appeared. Should Hetty wear her black veils, do you think, and Yawalla his
      black mask rather than any of his colored ones?<br/>Here is "Sylvia ", finished
      at last: the 5 stanzas are one for each sense, ending up with touch. The idea
      for it came from a neo-platonic poem of Clapman in which he imagined Ovid spying
      on the Emperor''s daughter (or was it niece?) in her bath and thus intoxicating
      each sense in turn,-ending with spiritual love, but only after the other kind
      has been satisfied.<br/>I went to Kensington yesterday but uselessly for apparently
      the collecting days are next Tuesday & Wednesday: it was the last day and there
      were 9 or 10 people there, taking considerable interest in the pictures. So
      I could not take your pieces away. However, as I was in town I went to a lecture
      at the N.P.G. on Victorian prime ministers: the subject for yesterday was Lord
      Robert Cecil, or Salisbury as he was later known as. It was an interesting-ish
