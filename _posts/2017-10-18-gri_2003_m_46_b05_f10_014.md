      Blackheath
      6 October 1952
      Dearest Sylvia,
      It was so nice to return last night and find two letters
      from you.  What a vivid picture of yourself you give, in the
      studio having tea, stretched on the sofa.  I can see you now.
      I am glad Tiny is being nice:  I hope her neck is better.
      I wait impatiently for you.  You say you expect to come
      on Thursday or Friday this week.  Magnificent.  If you come
      Thursday remember I have a lecture at the Tate (3-4).
      If Friday I can meet you anywhere and anytime.
      I miss you much and can hardly contain myself until you
      come to Blackheath.
      I quite understand about Aunt Elsie on the 31st.  (a music-
      al!  Lucky cat.)
      What you have to say about the writer in Sunset Boulevard
      is superb.  I shall expand my Shadow on Sunset Boulevard at
      once to include this lovely perception of yours.  Thank you
      so much, my collaborator, my muse.
      I slept well last night in my own bed and for 11 hours.
      The only trouble is I have no food in the house so hunger will
      drive me out soon...
      Let me tell you of my Lincoln afternoon yesterday:
      I spent two hours at the Cathedral (I have been extravagant
      and bought all the literature so you will be able to get an idea
      of it when you come here).  You may remember that I was anti-
      Early English:  no longer.  The Angel Choir--the five Eastern-
      most bays--is divine (Pevsner reproduces it in his Penguin).
      One of the carvings in the choir stall represents a scene
      for Chretien de Troyes (S. Yvain)--how it made me think of you.
      I have a picture of it.  There is a porch in the French manner
      (though somewhat restored).
      There is a nice Wesley chapel of the 1830s in the manner
      you taught me to appreciate--Greek and Egyptian.  It is very
      neat and compact:  behind it and up the hill is the colossal
      cathedral, diffuse and grand.  It is marvellously sited.  (An
      amusing contrast of architecture and faith.)
      The High School is in red brick and terra cotta of 1897.

      Blackheath

      6 October 1952

      Dearest Sylvia,

      It was so nice to return last knight and find two letters from you.  What a vivid picture of yourself you give, in the studio having tea, stretched on the sofa.  I can see you now.
      I am glad Tiny is being nice:  I hope her neck is better.
      I wait impatiently for you.  You say you expect to come on Thursday or Friday this week.  magnificent.  If you come Thursday remember I have a lecture at the Tate (3-4).  If Friday I can meet you anywhere anytime.

      I miss you so much and can hardly contain myself until you come to Blackheath.
      I quite understand about Aunt Elsie on the 31st.  (A musical !  Lucky cat.)
      What you have to say about the writer in Sunset Boulevard is superb.  I shall expand my Shadow on Sunset Boulevard at once to include this lovely perception of yours.  Thank you so much, my collaborator, my muse.
      I slept well last night in my own bed and all for 11 hours.  The only trouble is I have not food in the house so hunger will drive me out soon ...
      Let me tell you of my Lincoln  afternoon yesterday:
      I spent two hours at the Catherdral (I have been extravagant and  bought all the literature so you will be able to get an idea of it when you come here).  You may remember that I was anti-Early English: no longer.  The Angel Choir - the five Eastern-most bays - is divine (Pevsner reproduces it in his Penguin).
      One of the carvings in the choir stall represents a scene from Chretien de Troyes (S. Yvain) - how it made me think of you.  I have a picture of it.  There is a porch in the French manner (though somewhat restored).

      There is a nice Wesley chapel of the 1830's in the manner you taught me to appreciate - Greek and Egyptian.  It is very neat and compact: behind it and up the hill  is the colossal cathedral, diffuse and grand.  It is marvellously sited.  (An amusing contrast of Architecture and faith),
      The high school is in red brick and terracotta of 1897.  I did not mind it at all - indeed it is rather fetching.  I  believe I have already mentioned the excellent station.
