      for my muse           ii

      In boats or on the silhouetted bridges,
      Pacing the room or prone to lazing,
      In the circular museum,
      Listening to music, failing to sleep,
      The poet hunts or bribes the poem.

      Subjects form Orlando tempt,
      A still-life whispers in the light,
      Will no-one revive topography,
      Animals wait to spring in the tree of day,
      And images make fruit in every minute.

      Sylvia is my time and place,
      My season and my equinox,
      My landscape and my favorite position,
      Erotic, physical, a-musing,
      Muse, the year round, twenty-four hours a day.

      2-3 april 1950

      I love you
      Lawrence

      for my muse ii

      In boats or on the silhouetted bridges,
      Pacing the room or prone to lazing,
      In the circular museum,
      Listening to music, failing to sleep,
      The poet hunts or bribes the poem.

      Subjects from Orlando tempt,
      A still-life whispers in the light,
      Will no-one revive topography,
      Animals wait to spring in the tree of day,
      And images make fruit in every minute.

      Sylvia is my time and place,
      My season and my equinox,
      My landscape and my favorite postiton,
      Erotic, physical, a-musing,
      Muse, the year round, twenty-four hours a day.

      2-3 april 1950

      I love you
      Lawrence
