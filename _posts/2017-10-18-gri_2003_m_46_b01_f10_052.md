      MARS AND VENUS

      As amorini play
      With the abandoned armour,
      Experiment with echoes
      In his helmet, piss
      Upon the ornate shield,
      Mars sleeps, forgetting wars
      And dust and steel and blood,
      In Venus' gentle couch.

      It is the gift of love
      That all who honour her
      Experience content
      In simple nudity,
      Divest the fearful steel
      Fit for the putti's games.

      Darling I hope you are not upset too much by conflicts. I
      am not too bad. I long for you passionately and earnestly.
      I adore you.

      The cool precise profile of Florentine
      Ladies, does that suffice to catch your grace?
      I think their elegance a shade acquired.

      Or seen by Lely in Minervan dress,
      Stern in a lorica Apollo gilds.
      But what of flesh, impulsive not erudite?

      Perhaps a Fragonard girl, amorous
      Upon a tousled bed, delicate, plump.
      Carming but not, no, not, a perfect likeness.

      In a landscape peopled by Venetians,
      Water and music blended, I approach
      More nearly to your double, but my Muse

      you so and wish I could just carry you away. I cannot directly
      help you, alas, I wish so passionately I could. I just assure
      you of my love and promise you happiness.

      About ringing me. If you cannot ring me on Saturday after-
      noon perhaps you will ring me on Sunday morning? I imagine you
      will travel Sat. morning and be at the 400 in the evening...
      But I will stay in Saturday afternoon and if you cannot will
      you be sure to ring me Sunday Morning? I will be free to see
      you if there should be an opportunity. I long to hear you again.
      I hope it will be a call-box or a private phone if possible. Oh
      Sylvia I love you so much.

      MARS AND VENUS

      As amorini play
      With the abandoned armour,
      Experiment with echoes
      In his helmet, piss
      Upon the ornate shield,
      Mars sleeps, forgetting wars
      And dust and steel and blood,
      In Venus' gentle couch.

      It is the gift of love
      That all who honour her
      Experience content
      In simple nudity,
      Divest the fearful steel
      Fit for the putti's games.

      Darling I hope you are not upset too much by conflicts. I
      am not too bad. I long for you passionately and earnestly.
      I adore you.

      The cool precise profile of Florentine
      Ladies, does that suffice to catch your grace?
      I think their elegance a shade acquired.

      Or seen by Lely in Minervan dress,
      Stern in a lorica Apollo gilds.
      But what of flesh, impulsive not erudite?

      Perhaps a Fragonard girl, amorous
      Upon a tousled bed, delicate, plump.
      Charming but not, no, not, a perfect likeness.

      In a landscape peopled by Venetians,
      Water and music blended, I approach
      More nearly to your double, but my Muse
