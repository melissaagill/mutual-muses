      and, there is Scaplio in Utopia Limited:
      'When I love it will be the accumulated fervour of sixty-six years. But I have an ideal - a semi-transparent Being, filled with an inorganic pink-jelly.'
      Princess Ida is wildly anti-feminist & Ruddigore relates with Dorian: also I think Auden benefitted from Gilbert.
      I love you & look forward to seeing you very soon, my dearest, I love you
