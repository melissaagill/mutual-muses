      This morning, shamed by the sunlight
      I did some house work, as well as pre-
      pared my lecture.  I am afraid that
      even when I got home yesterday the
      plant (I am not sure how to spell its
      name) had wilted, flopping outwards
      from the centre, over the jardiniere.
      This morning it was no better.  What
      am I do do?  You watered it only
      yesterday.
      By the way, you may be interested
      to hear that Rembrandt's El Illuminations
      are influenced by translations from
      Cliver verse which were current
      in the 2nd Empire:  Gautier's dau-
      gate Judith published one such col-
      lection.  I Live de Jade.

      I must set off for Banstead, via
      the Public Library at Wimbledon.
      Sleep well my dear love.  You are
      my life.
      I love you
      Lawrence

      This morning, shamed by the sunlight
      I did some housework, as well as pre-
      pared my lecture. I am afraid that
      even when I got home yesterday the
      plant (I am not sure how to spell its
      name) had wilted, flopping outwards
      from the centre, over the jardiniere.
      This morning it was no better. What
      am I to do? You watered it only
      yesterday.
      By the way, you may be interested
      to hear that Riambaud's Les Illuminations
      are influenced by translations from
      Chinese verse which were current
      in the 2nd Empire: Gautier's dau-
      ghter Judith published one such col-
      lection, Le Livre de Jade.
      I must set off for Barstead, via
      the Public Library at Wimbledon.
      Sleep well my dear love. You are
      my life.
      I love you
      Lawrence
