      25 viii 1949   Blackheath

      Dearest Sylvia,

      I hope you are well today- I send you every fond wish and sweet greeting. Yesterday's letter was, I fear, perhaps a little disconnected, it was written in the Tate, but I'm sure I managed to say the most important thing- namely that I love you.

      Today I am going to write about Marriage a la Mode and perhaps revise, slightly, an earlier chapter in the interests of unity. I shall be thinking of you all the time. You are the art historian's Muse as well as the Poet's.

      Paul sends his love to you. I told him that you hoped that, one day, he would sit for you and he was delighted and charmed. I have ensured him that he will be a good patient sitter by telling him of the bad ones... But, as I said, he has sat, often, in Liverpool. I told him you were looking forward to our Deptford visit- and he is himself. He flattered you to me last night in terms extravagant without being unobjective. We enjoyed The Beax' Stratagem very much. Kay Hammond was deliciously impudent- though, her dresses were not the prettiest except her nightclothes. It is not a remarkably graceful production, rather it is precise and swift. There is a divine moment when Kay Hammond passes an open window in the country with the sun coming in and she urgently opens a tiny parasol to enable her to pass it safely.

      After writing to you yesterday I spent a short time in the Vienna Treasures. I heard Robin Pearce lecturing. He has a wide vocabulary, which, however, does not exclude vulgarisms like 'set-up' and 'part-and-parcel'. He says of mid-16th century Flemish

    annotation_text: "25 viii 1949 Blackheath\nDearest Sylvia, \nI hope you are well
      today - I send you every fond wish and sweet greeting. Yesterday's letter was,
      I fear, perhaps a little disconcected, it was written in the Tate. But I'm sure
      I managed to say the most important thing - namely that I love you.\nToday I
      am going to write about Marriage a la Mode and perhaps revise, slightly, an
      earlier chapter in the interests of unity. I shall be thinking of you all the
      time. You are the art historian's Muse as well as the Poet's.\nPaul sends his
      love to you. I told him that you hoped that, one day, he would sit for you and
      he was delighted and charmed. I have ensured that he will be a good patient
      sitter by telling him of the bad ones .... But, as I said, he has sat, often,
      in Liverpool. I told him you were looking forward to our Deptford visit - and
      he is himself. He flattered you to me last night in terms extravagant without
      being unobjective. We enjoyed The Beaux Stratagem very much. Kay Hammon was
      deliciously umpudent - though, her dresses were not the prettiest except her
      nightclothes. It is not a remarkably graceful production, rather it is precise
      and swift. There is a divine moment when Kay Hammond passes an open window in
      the country with the sun coming in and she ungently opens a tiny parasol to
      enable her to pass safely.\nAfter writing to you yesterday I spent a short time
      in the Vienna Treasures. I heard Robin Pearce lecturing. He has a wide vocabluary
      which, however, does not exclude vulgarisms like 'set-up' and 'part-and-parcel'.
      He  says of mid-16th century Flemish"
