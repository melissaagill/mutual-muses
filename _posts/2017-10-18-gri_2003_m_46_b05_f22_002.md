      but I still feel quite exhausted!
      4:25 I expect that you are
      nearly home by now - dear Lion.
      I wish I were with you. I am
      having my tea in the studio with
      the tray conveniently placed on
      the card table, so that I can reach
      it comfortably from the sopha I
      have finished up the cherry cake -
      I made it a week ago to-day
      in anticipation of your visit, dear
      Lawrence. Oh I do look forward to
      your next - and nearer pleasure to
      seeing you  in town. Town and tea
      reminds me I will send the tea
      coupon to you for your mother -
      I don't think it will be too late.
      I wish I had thought of it before.
      While I was waiting for the
      Kettle to boil I read about
      GeonaldO and Madrijals - (Sept.
      18th Listener) do read it - I
      think it would interest you - it
      mentions a poem by Tasso, I
      should love to read.

      I have been painting the
      paper round the liquor bottle, it
      is going nicely but it is a great
      effort - I have also painted in -
