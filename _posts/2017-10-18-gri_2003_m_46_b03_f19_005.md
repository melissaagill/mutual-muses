      Dearest Lawrence 8.11.50

      I am writing to Blackheath for of course, my letter would not reach B'ham in time. I hope you conclude that I will be coming on Sunday? I am coming on the usual bus, though being Sunday, winter, and less traffic I expect that it will arrive early and probably stop on the main road - by the "market", about the middle of it.

      I do hope that your lecture is a great success.

      We have not heard from one tenant yet - I imagine he will stay on another last night, but I can't be sure. I hope he does - I think it will be easier to let after Christmas.

      Until Sunday, dearest one.

      I love you.

      Sylvia.

      the middle of it.
      I do hope that your lecture is a
      great success.
      We have not heard from our
      tenant yet - I imagine he will stay
      on another fortnight - but I can't
      be sure. I hope he does - I think
      it will be easier to let after
      Christmas.
      Until Sunday, dearest one.
      I love you
      Sylvia
