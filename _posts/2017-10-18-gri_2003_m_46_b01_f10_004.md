      our painting and poetry is testimony to
      this. Love is astonishingly creative in
      suitable lovers.

      When you leave Michael it is not,
      as you half fear, part of a pattern you
      have suffered before, because I love
      you as you want, need, and deserve, to
      be loved. It is the consumation of, and
      not a stage in, your search, as it is for
      me also. Oh Sylvia, I love you. As
      you say we will all be destroyed if things
      go on like this. But, as I said above, I
      will help Michael if I can, and perhaps
      later he will give us the chance.

      I am confident of our future - not
      heartlessly optimistic, but seriously
      and lovingly confident.

      Thank you dearest for our weekend.
