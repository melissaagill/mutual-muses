      [unclear]with[/unclear] me when I have had such pleasures
      for I always think so [unclear]?[/unclear] of you
      at such times.
      We went from [unclear]Holt[/unclear] to Bradford - on
      Avon to tea, a charming town (wool
      industry rely old established there.)
      and after tea looked at another
      exquisite house. The Hall [unclear]where'd[/unclear]
      believe is quite famous.
      I shall send you the drawings
      as soon as I can - but with
      letter which came this [unclear]Monday[/unclear].
      Aunt Margaret's brother had a fall
      and so is in my room and I
      am next door so I could not
      finish this properly yesterday as I
      had hoped. He is not badly hurt
      only cut and shaken, and will
      go home tomorrow.

    clean_transcription: with me when I have had such pleasures<br/>for I always think
      so intently of you<br/>at such times.<br/>We went from Holt to Bradford- on<br/>Avon
      to tea, a charming town, (wool<br/>industry very old established there)<br/>and
      after tea looked at another <br/>exquisite house, The Hall which I<br/>believe
      is quite famous.<br/>I shall send you the drawings<br/>as soon as I can - but
      will<br/>send this now. Thanks for your<br/>letter which came this morning.<br/>Aunt
      Margaret's brother had a fall<br/>and so is in my room and I<br/>am next door
      so could not<br/>finish this properly yesterday as I<br/>had hoped. He is not
      badly hurt<br/>only cut and shaken, and will<br/>go home tomorrow.<br/>I love
      you I adore you<br/>Sylvia<br/>
