      Dearest Sylvia
      Your letter today pleases me and makes me happy to have so spirited a communication from my love though I am sorry to hear you were tired & that the weather has frustrated your creative efforts to some extent.  Aren't the Leicester Galleries silly - not to make your landscapes centre-piece for the 1st show, at the very least!  I anticipate seeing your new works, even the unfinished ones, with excitement & desire.

      Last night I saw Les Enfants Terribles - written but not directed with Cocteau.  It is interesting but less well acted than Orphée & shows signs of having been adapted from a novel.  Death and love and adolescence occur in a fascinating tangle but without making the impact of Orphée & lacking too its delicacy.

      Here is the second section of a fairly surrealistic poem about Paris:
      As the Summer turns green above the night-ferry
      Winds unmask the calm of the spider's web
      Spun by the afternoon across the city

      A rain drop splinters on my wrist
      Damp as an insect I have killed

      As the rocks melt above Les Halles
      The daylight collapses voluptuously
      Silver skewers varnish the trays of fruit

      Statues of Paris in the green evening
      Secure the heritage of the [unclear]anbade[/unclear]
      The blinds are terrible to the night
