      [[centered]] 2 [[/centered]]

      The clouds are shuffled like a pack of cards
      Across the azure table of the sky.

           I have nearly finished a Hogarth chapter, so I have (almost) written about his life up to the age of 40.  When the other chapter is ready it will be 10,000 words, introducing one to the chapters (excluding [[underlined]] Analysis [[/underlined]] which is later) you have already read.  Then I shall go to Hodders. . . .

           You have painted the pear-tree again!  How exciting - I am interested to see you you make it look this time, my dearest.

           Thank you again for your letter which cheers me up somewhat.  I have some poems nearly finished to send you immediately ('immediately' in the C 18th sense of 'shortly').

           I wish I had your charm with me.

           I love you

      I have nearly finished a Hogarth chapter, so i have (almost) written about his life up to the age of 40. When the other chapter is ready it will be 10,000 words, introducing one to the chapters (excluding Analysis which is later) you have already read. Then I shall go to Hodders....

      You have painted the pear - tree again! How exciting - I am interested to see how you make it look this time, my dearest.

      Thank you again for your letter which cheers me up somewhat. I have some poems nearly finished to send you immediately ('immediately' in the (18th sense of 'shortly').

      I wish I had your charm with me.

      I love you
