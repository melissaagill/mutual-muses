      2. Perhaps the air your statue holds?
      I must be near.

      Last night I typed out some of the poems for you which had been mounting up un-typed. Then I looked for the Shakespeare sonnet you quoted in the Tate - and I found it. I knew only the first line.
      What a lovely poem it is.

      What a beautiful creature you are. Seeing you, again, after a few days, I felt much as I used to feel when I met you after a long absence. Love has its own time-scale. I judge time, not by its conventional attributes - those mortal cliches - but by you, by your arrivals and departures, your heart beats and your kisses.

      I hope your journey back was pleasant. It was still very hot so I did all my work with nothing on and felt nice and cool. It is ten o'clock - and I have watered all the flowers already and I shall do them again before I go
