      Dearest Sylvia,
      Thank you for your letters, both of which came this morning.  The sun is bright today and, at least on this side of the window, warm.  I have just had breakfast: I wish you were here so that we could have one of [unclear]our long[/unclear] [unclear]this - [/unclear] [unclear][/unclear] breakfasts.
      I am glad indeed to hear that you have finished your painting.  I look forward, very much, to seeing it.  And, moreover, it is very good news that 'wades' is going [unclear][/unclear] for you.  (I expect one of her boyfriends will [unclear]buy[/unclear]...).
      IC is very [unclear]kind[/unclear] of 'Wacks' to say she will send me a photograph.  Still I doubt if the conflict between art & photography (what with Hetty and Ajax) will be decided differently even when I've seen the 'snap'.  I did my best to look like a [unclear](16ch[/unclear] picture.  I tremble to think if I have succeeded or no.
      What a lonely story about Carol & you trying on your dresses while Tiny laboured below with a [unclear]bean![/unclear]
      Poor Ruth, nursing!  Still, on you say, she [unclear]will[/unclear] enjoy being away from home.
      I am not eligible for 60 because [unclear]Leonard[/unclear] Russell edits [unclear][/unclear] and you may remember that he will not help me as I lost some photographs a long time ago.  Thank you for suggesting it, however.
      I have found various small paints in [unclear]Orplee [/unclear] which confirm your original interpretations.  I doubt if I shall be
