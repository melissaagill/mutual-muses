      Blackheath
      Sunday

      Dearest Sylvia,

      I have been re-reading your letters - the ones you
      have sent during the past two weeks, that is - and
      how charmingly your personality and love are express-
      ed in your pages.  It has made me agreeably nostal-
      gic and I shall dally, all day, with thoughts of you
      in the past and anticipations of our renewed meet-
      ing this week.  I had thought to hear this morning:
      if you have not written by the time you get this
      letter on Tuesday morning would you send a wire?
      I think we are to meet in a day or two and long to
      know when.  You said in your letter that if you did
      not come on the 25th it would only mean the delay of
      a day.  Does that mean I am to see you the day af-
      ter tomorrow?

      I hope your painting of Tiny is satisfactory: have
      you nearly finished it?  Will you be able to bring
      it with you for the exhibition?  Your lion looks
      forward very much to seeing it - and its painter.

      I love you.  I think of you elegantly lazy in the
      bath or sternly busy at your easel, working hard just
      as the light starts to go.  I remember how warm you
      were in bed after I had got out, put the kettle on,
      and got back in bed:  it was wonderful.

      Today I have a N.G. school lecture on Impressionists
      and another on Wednesday afternoon.  That is all for
      this week.

      Let me, my dove, know soon.
      Your easel will be ready on Wednesday and I want to
      know how much shopping to do. I love you,
      I love you,
      I love you,
      Lawrence.

      Blackheath
      Sunday

      Dearest Sylvia,

      I have been re-reading your letters - the ones you have sent during the past two weeks, that is - and how charmingly your personality and love are expressed in your pages. It has made me agreeably nostalgic and I shall dally, all day, with thoughts of you in the past and anticipations of our renewed meeting this week. I had thought to bear this morning: if you have not written by the time you get this letter on Tuesday morning would you send me a wire? I think we are to meet in a day or two and long to know when. You said in your letter that if you did not come on the 25th it would only mean the delay of a day. Does that mean I am to see you the day after tomorrow?

      I hope your painting of Tiny is satisfactory: have you nearly finished it? Will you be able to bring it with you for the exhibition? Your lion looks forward very much to seeing it - and its painter.

      I love you. I think of you elegantly lazy in the bath or sternly busy at your easel, working hard just as the light starts to go. I remember how warm you were in bed after I had got out, put the kettle on, and got back in bed: it was wonderful.

      Today I have a N.G. school lecture on Impressionists and another on Wednesday afternoon. That is all for this week.

      Let me, my dove, know soon.
      Your easel will be ready on Wednesday and I want to know how much shopping to do.

      I love you,
      I love you,
      I love you,

      Lawrence
