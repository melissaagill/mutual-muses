      The Temptation of a Saint

      Poetry is autonomous and allegorical,
      The clown of asleep in the bed of awake,
      The hermit saint among the gregarious flowers,
      The patron of astonishment and order.

      Progressive Apollo: the atonal dawn
      Whips the emperor of reaction
      In secret listening caves and his cries
      Are part of the orchestral moment.

      Dawn is the sun god's erection,
      Tearing the membrane of the miss of night:
      Later, a gold broach at the throat of day
      Holding the blue shawl tight across her breasts.

      So many landscapes are accessible
      Beyond the puritan cave of the skull:
      What bridges, labyrinths, farms, and capes,
      What forests, walls, and waterfalls.

      In the hotel of water outside the cave
      The tilted dancers glow, as in arcades;
      The rippling glass shutters of the tide
      Fumble the swimmer's groin:  Hermaphrodite.

      Where aer you from, Atlantis?
      When do you return, when I am a hundred?
      Who do you think you are or do you wiat
      For me to name you, swimmer with my own face?

      Jargon of marine, protect the Syrens,
      Tangible as wedding-cakes of seaweed:
      Blue monumental listener, blue on the shore,
      Replace the conches in their innocent disorder.

      The sensual retorts dripping love philtres
      Are my annuntiation to the ear
      Listening in a woman's groin,
      Enemy only of heiratic silence.

      Cushions filled with princesses' hair
      (As lovers are filled with locks of blood)
      Support the fall of lovers and their drums
      In the fauve gallery of mattresses.
