      15 v. 1953
      My dearest Sylvia:
      I have now got off all the photographs (it cost a bomb sending them air-mail) and the articleitself. I had to rush it & I have a few improvements to make, but Robert Melville thinks I may not get a proof as time is so short. So I think I better send the corrections to them with 'biographical material' which they have asked for. [unclear]Ginpel fils/unclear] and Robert Melville have been especially helpful with photographs - but we have the individual sculptors. I have seen Robert several times lately & you know how I value that.
      Now that rush is over I have lecture every day of the week next week.
      I have several poems in process at the moment. It seems easier to write verse again then it has been lately - & this feels good. You know from your painting just how good. Thanks to a chance remark of Connies' when we were at Chelt -
