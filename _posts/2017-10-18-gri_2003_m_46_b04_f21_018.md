      heard of the books you mention.
      Did you see what the Kensington
      Gallery have got from the eleventh
      until the 29th?  Let me die!
      I did laugh when I saw it!
      You will be pleased to hear I
      quite enjoyed this evening with
      the Savages--he had some lovely
      [unclear][/unclear] of about the 5 from
      Olympus.  I horse's bit--complete
      two small bronze horses.
      I another object--probably a seal,
      2 the form of a horse--and
      Etruscan figurine, and a Roman
      Magical figure--which I will tell
      you about--most strange.  They sent us home with lots of mushrooms
      and putt-balls--which I love.
