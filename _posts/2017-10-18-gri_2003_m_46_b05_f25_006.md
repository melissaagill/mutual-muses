      I washed my hands and did not look in the glass.
      a channel-swimmer was folded like a towel
      In the bathroom by the silver taps,
      Among the bottles and bent combs.
      Her arms felt soft as stocking on my thighs.

      I killed a gardener.  I crushed his head.
      I shall return one afternoon and find
      The clothes -line rotting in the gaunt gazebo,
      Weeds taller than the balcony and the orchard
      Flashing flinty capsules, not soft fruit.

      Did I cut the throat of an introvert?
      He would not notice.  Was there more to come?
      That was him lying on the cushions.
      Perhaps a girl he might have tortured
      Will rave in Easter Island loneliness.

      I killed an extrovert.  He screamed for hours
      As the hives and telegrams retreated,
      As he lost the scent of flowers and horses,
      As the slanted walls dissolved in crimson fronds,
      And the sense of plenitude diminished.

      How many sailors will not see the wings of cliff
      Swelling from the crystal ball of mist?
      As I lie on the lea and count the pearls
      That I can shake loose from marine-creatures
      I count on the silence of the crow's-nest.

      Was there a countess of the North who died
      Before the sun was West?  I sank a fan
      In a lake of fingers.  Now the ice
      Makes a dazzling hall unscarred by skaters
      Who did not last the violence of summer.

      Excellent as a proverb or a wine,
      Sensual and hampered as oases,
      Among cassoni of success I down
      The yielding dead and bury lovingly
      The heroes of the cult in rocky places.

      How many soldiers ended in the first set
      And hang like bunches of grapes from the trees
      Above the readers of detective stories.
      I went in the wood, rode the stile alone
      And left before the genius loci woke.

      two

      I washed my hands and did not look in the glass.
      A chanel-swimmer was folded like a towel
      In the bathroom by the silver taps,
      Among the bottles and bent combs.
      Her arms felt soft as stockings on my thighs.

      I killed a gardener. I crushed his head.
      I shall return on afternoon and find
      The clothes line rotting in the gaunt gazebo,
      Weeds taller than the balcony and the orchard
      Flashing flinty capsules, not soft fruit.

      Did I cut the throat of an introvert?
      He would not notice. Was there more to come?
      That was him lying on the cushions.
      Perhaps a girl he might have tortured will
      Will rave in Easter Island loneliness.

      I killed an extrovert. He screamed for hours
      As the hives and telegrams retreated,
      As he lost the scent of flowers and horses,
      As the slanted walls dissolved in crimson fronds,
      And the sense of plenitude diminished.

      How many sailors will not see the wings of cliff
      Swelling from the crystal ball of mist?
      As I lie on the lea and count the pearls
      That I can shake loose from marine-creatures
      I count on the silence of the crow's-nest.

      Was there a countess of the North who died
      Before the sun was West? I sank a fan
      In a lake of fingers. Now the ice
      Makes a dazzling hall unscarred by skaters
      Who did not last the violence of summer.

      Excellent as a proverb or a wine,
      Sensual and hampered as oases,
      Among cassoni of success I down
      The yielding dead and bury lovingly
      The heroes of the cult in rocky places.

      How many soldiers ended in the first act
      And hang like bunches of grapes from the trees
      Above the readers of detective stories.
      I went in the wood, rode the stile alone
      And left before the geniues loci woke.
