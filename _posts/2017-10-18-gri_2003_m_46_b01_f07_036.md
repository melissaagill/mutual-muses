      Dearest Sylvia,
      I have been going to bed fairly early recently and I woke at 7.30 this morning. Immediately I ran downstairs, so eager that I forgot my parents might be up and did not put anything on, and found TWO letters on the mat for me. Oh, imagine my delight. I inspected the postmarks and took care to read them in order. (My parents were not up I should, perhaps, say.)
      Alas, it is what I feared, that 'the situation is very tense'. My poor Sylvia, I know that dreadful numbing despair you experienced. I am sure that sunbathing and painting will make it diminish. I am fairly tranquil again - inasmuch as the ache which I thought would never stop, a physical feeling, has abated. In your second letter, you have news of a portrait of Michael you have started: this I am sure is good for both of you and I expect sitting still for you will arouse in Michael the desire to paint again.
      Yesterday I went on the river with Johnson and the Poisers. It was dull, but I got a lot of exercise since Philip and I did nearly all the rowing as Johnson was satisfied to steer. That is what I wanted anyway. Johnson and I are quite alright again now. No [unclear]'coolth'[/unclear] at all. He has given me a letter for the B.M. library which I have sent off.
      By the way, what about Michael's portrait of You? And speaking of Michael's painting reminds me: I can get Biro refills without giving up the inside of my pen if he wants one for  drawing. The Piccadilly branch just gives you the nib and ink tube and you do the changing yourself. They are 2s.3d. each.
      I am surrounded by books and papers. I am working on the Harlot's and the Rake's Progress. With luck I shall finish that section of my book before the end of the week. I shall work all afternoon, despite the invitation to sunbathe. Perhaps I shall snatch an hour about tea time.
      I remember that you told me once how, after a visit to Pett, you peopled the rooms, the chair I sat in, and so on, with me. That is exactly what has occurred since your visit here. Apart from my continual thought about you - vivid, actual recollections are called up by all the rooms you went in, all the things you touched. The sunflowers on the curtains have become symbolic.

      Dearest Sylvia,

           I have been going to bed fairly early recently and I woke at 7.30 this morning.  Immediately I ran downstairs, so eager that I forgot my parents might be up and did not put anything on, and found TWO letters on the mat for me.  Oh, imagine my delight.  I inspected the postmarks and took care to read them in order.  (My parents were not up I should, perhaps, say.)

           Alas, it is what I feared, that 'the situation is very tense'.  My poor Sylvia, I know that dreadful numbing despair you experienced. I am sure that sun-bathing and painting will make it diminish.  I am fairly tranquil again - inasmuch as the ache which I thought would never stop, a physical feeling, has abated.  In your second letter you have news of a portrait of Michael you have started:  this I am sure is good for both of you and I expect sitting still for you will arouse in Michael the desire to paint again.

           Yesterday I went on the river with Johnson and the Poisers.  It was dull but I got a lot of exercise since Phillip and I did nearly all the rowing as Johnson was satisfied to steer.  That is what I wanted anyway.  Johnson and I are quite alright again now. No 'coolth' at all.  He has given me a letter for the B.M. library which I have sent off.

           By the way, what about Michael's painting reminds me:  I can get Biro refills without giving up the inside of my pen now if he wants one for drawing.  The Piccadilly branch just gives you the nib and ink tube and you do the changing yourself.  They are 2s.3d. each.

           I am surrounded by books and papers.  I am working on the Harlot's and the Rake's Progress.  With luck I shall finish that section of my book before the end of the week.  I shall work all afternoon, despite the invitation to sunbathe.  Perhaps I shall snatch an hour about tea time.

           I remember that you told me once how, after a visit to Pett, you peopled the rooms, the chair I sat in, and so on, with me.  That is exactly what has occurred since your visit here.  Apart from my continual thought about you - vivid, actual recollections are called up by all the rooms you went in, all the things you touched.  The sunflowers on the curtains have become symbolic.

      I have been going to bed fairly early recently and I woke at 7.30 this morning.
