      Did I, by any chance, include my Biro in the parcel I sent you? I can't find it anywhere and I missed it after I sent the parcel off.

      Here is a sonnet for you:  I wrote it this morning after breakfast, a few minutes ago.

      Sunbath or sleepless night subscribe relief,
      Or fail to spark the phoenix in his clay:
      The accidents of time and place occur
      Like brambles active distant from their roots,
      That seem irrelevant.  Desire depends
      On object not symbols, My desire
      Is naturalistic to a fault and bribes
      No re-assuring counterpart or ghost.
      Therefore the pears upon the window-ledge
      Are hard or sleepy, not equivalent
      To the taste of love's original:
      Despite the claims of transference the room
      Defeats the symbol with cool enmity
      And longs to be the background of our love.

      I love you,  Laurence

      Dandy lion's mane's even tidy at the back.

      P.S. I enclose a cheque for the Â£5 you gave me just before you went away.

          Did I, by any chance, include my Biro pen in the par-
      cel I sent you?   I can't find it anywhere and I missed
      it after I sent the parcel off.

          Here is a sonnet for you:  I wrote it this morn-
      ing after breakfast, a few minutes ago.

                Sunbath or sleepless night subscribe relief,
                Or fail to spark the phoenix in his clay:
                The accidents of time and place occur
                Like brambles active distant from their roots,
                That seem irrelevant.   Desire depends
                On obect not on symbols,   My desire
                I s naturalistic to a fault and bribes
                No re-assuring counerpart or ghost.
                Therefore the pears upon the window-ledge
                Are hard or sleepy, not equivalent
                To the taste of love's original:
                Despite the claims of transference the room
                Defeats the symbol with cool enmity
                And longs to be the background of our love.

          I love you,

                                   Lawrence
