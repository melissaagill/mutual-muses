      I have taken your advice, rung Paul up, and I am to meet him tomorrow evening.  Also tomorrow I have another lecture, in the morning.

      Here is a poem for you, my love, perhaps part of a sequence to include the last poem I sent you, the card game one:

      In the shortage of centaurs
      What can you use for journeys,
      What can you use, but clouds,
      So nearly soft but truly couched?

      The local gods of the weather,
      The major gods of climate,
      Put at your disposal
      These numinous conveyances.

      Zephyrus alone
      Is zealous with cloud couches,
      Chariots, never phaetons,
      To cross the long plantations.

      So with the weather-changes
      Clouds shall transport you here,
      Though when we meet, Phoebus dispense,
      With the currency of clouds.

      I am interested to hear you have done some more work on 'Painting out of Doors' - I look forward to reading it very much.  In reading Clark's Leonardo book I have come across some small details about Giorgione of which I have made a note for your use later on.  Are you still reading S. Sitwel...   I have finished Swann in Love:  it is really astonishing.

      I long to live with you again, my warm, generous, beautiful creature, dazzling rose at the centre of the labyrinth of life.  It is infuriating that our pleasures should be postponed, our love delayed, for want of a little money.  (Yawolla has gone out masked, with a sack, and cudgel.)  Oh my dearest love, you are never out of my thoughts, a glorious overpowering image in my pre-conscious in those few minutes of activity when you are not consciously in my mind.  How rare, whether lecturing or travelling, reading or writing, eating or sleeping, are the moments when I do not adoringly contemplate you images, your memory, my hope for the future, as though turning over a magnificent, endless Emblem Book, illustrated by your art, your imagination, your body.

      I have taken your advice, rung Paul up, and I am to meet him
      tomorrow evening. Also tomorrow I have another lecture, in
      the morning.

      Here is a poem for you, my love, perhaps part of a sequence to include the last poem I sent you, the card game one:
      In the shortage of centaurs
      What can you use for journeys,
      What can you use, but clouds,
      So nearly soft but truly couched?

      The local gods of the weather,
      The major gods of climate,
      Put at your disposal
      These numinous conveyances.

      Zephyrus alone
      Is zealous with cloud couches,
      Chariots, never phantoms,
      To cross the long plantations.

      So with the weather-changes
      Clouds shall transport you here,
      Though when we meet, Phoebus dispense
      With the currency of clouds.

      I am interested to hear you have done some more work on 'Paint-
      ing out of Doors' - I look forward to reading it very much. In
      reading Clark's Leonardo book I have come across some small de-
      tails about Giorgione  of which I have made a note for your use
      later on. Are you still reading S. Stillwell... I have finished
      Swann in love: it is really astonishing.

      I long to live with you again, my warm, generous, beautiful
      creature, dazzling rose, at the centre of the labyrinth of life.
      It is infuriating that our pleasures should be postponed, our
      love delayed, for want of a little money. (Yawolla has gone
      out masked, with a sack, and a cudgel.) Oh my dearest love,
      you are never out of my thoughts, a glorious overpowering image
      in my pre-conscious in those few minutes of activity when you
      are not consciously in my mind. Now rare, whether lecturing
      or traveling, reading or writing, eating or sleeping, are the
      moments when I do not adoringly contemplate your images, your
      memory, my hope for the future, as though turning over a magni-
      ficent endless Emblem Book, illustrated by your art, your imagina-
      tion, your body.
