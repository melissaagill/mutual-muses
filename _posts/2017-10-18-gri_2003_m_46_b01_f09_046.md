      ( The quotation is from Spenser's Ruins
      Of Rome. )

      I hope you are better now. It is
      good news about the Rectory picture:
      thought M. did not like it. Explain
      his change of front... Thank you for
      the cheque. May I, perhaps, bother
      you to send me soon your library tick-
      ets. Be assured I shall behave myself
      with them.

      I shall write to Lines this evening
      and tell him the 5th.

      Like you I too must fly if I am to
      get to the post. Working all day I
      did not see how time was getting on.

      It was very nice indeed to have a
      letter from you again and it became a
      huge pleasure when I read it because
      of the things you said.

      Oh dearest Sylvia. How I love you.

      hope you are better now.  It is good news about the Rectory picture: I thought
      M. did not like it.  Explain his change of front...  Thank you for the cheque.  May
      I, perhaps, bother you to send me soon your library tickets?  Be assured I shall
      behave myself with them.<br/><br/>I shall write to Lines this evening and tell
      him the 5th.<br/><br/>Like you I too must fly if I am to get to the post.  Working
      all day I did not see how time was getting on.<br/><br/>It was very nice indeed
      to have a letter from you again and it became a huge pleasure when I read it
      because of the things you said.<br/><br/>Oh dearest Sylvia.  How I love you.<br/><br/>Lawrence'
