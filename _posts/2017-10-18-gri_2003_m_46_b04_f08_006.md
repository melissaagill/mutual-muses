      Dearest Sylvia

      Here is your broach - I am sorry not to
      have sent it before.

      I am on my way to the V&A (that rhymes!)
      to study English artist from [unclear]Halheim to Hilliard[/unclear].
      I do wish you were here so I could have the
      benefit of your knowledge: I [unclear]should have
      to love the houses - such as longleat[unclear] - as
      well.

      My father has left Paris for [unclear]O ieppe[/unclear] where he is
      now. He is returning early - on Friday: appar-
      ently he is finding his own company [unclear][/unclear].
      He has seen all the places I listed for him - it
      was a shorter list than M would have prepared,
      I can tell you.

      By the way, what about the V&A assistants
      job for M...?

      Constant Lambert is dead! Only 45 years of
      age, too. Terrible loss.

      What do you think of the Coventry Cathedral
      designs? I haven't seen them - I've only
      heard of them. By Basil Spence, I believe.

      I hear there has been an advertisement for

      Here is your broach - I am sorry not to have sent it before.
      I am on my way to the V & A (that rhymes!) to study English artists from Holbein to Hilliard. I do wish you were here so I could have the benefit of your knowledge: I shall have to cover the houses - such as Longleat - as well.
      My father has left Paris for Dieppe where he is now. He is returning early - on Friday: apparently he is finding his own company unrewarding. He has seen all the places I listed for him: it was a shorter list than M would have prepared, I can tell you.
