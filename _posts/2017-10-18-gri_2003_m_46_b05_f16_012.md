      Dearest Lawrence,
      I had such a bad headache all
      yesterday that I have played truant
      from church this morning and have
      pottered about framing and tidying
      up a bit.  I have framed my still life
      fro Dido" in a pale gold frame and
      I think that it looks very well.
      I have an octagonal frame which I
      got from the Hones' the opening being
      11 inches across and admiring that
      chasing head in a gesso frame with a
      mirror in V&A it I thought I might enriculate
      it and making heads of Venus and means
      write some gross work!  Yesterday
      to try to sooth my headache I drew
      a shouting young man after Leondardo
      supper imposed over a copy of hte Friday
      enigmatic St. Anue!  I have not
      finished drawing her yet.  Then I shall
      paint something quite freely.

      5-4-52 Pett Dearest Lawrence,
      I had such a bad head ache all
      yesteray, that I have played truant
      from chuch this morning and have
      pottered about framing and tidying
      up a bit. I have framed my "still life
      for Dido" in a pale gold frame and
      I think that it looks very well.
      I have an octangonal frame which I
      got from the Jones' the opening being
      11 inches across and admiring that
      charming head in a gesso frame with a
      mirror in V & A. I thought I might emulate
      it and making heads of Venus and Mars
      with some gesso work! Yesterday
      to try to sooth my headache, I drew
      a shouting young man after Leonardo
      superimposed over a copy of the Friday
      enigmatic St. Anne! I have not
      finished drawing her yet. Then I shall
      paint something quite freely.

      all<br/>yesteray, that I have played truant<br/>from chuch this morning and
      have<br/>pottered about framing and tidying<br/>up a bit. I have framed my "still
      life<br/>for Dido" in a pale gold frame and<br/>I think that it looks very well.<br/>I
      have an octangonal frame which I<br/>got from the Jones' the opening being<br/>11
      inches across and admiring that<br/>charming head in a gesso frame with a<br/>mirror
      in V & A. I thought I might emulate<br/>it and making heads of Venus and Mars<br/>with
      some gesso work! Yesterday<br/>to try to sooth my headache, I drew<br/>a shouting
      young man after Leonardo<br/>superimposed over a copy of the Friday<br/>enigmatic
      St. Anne! I have not<br/>finished drawing her yet. Then I shall<br/>paint something
      quite freely.
