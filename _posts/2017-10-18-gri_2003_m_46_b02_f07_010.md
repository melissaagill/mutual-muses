      Good for Mr Hanley:  he has a wise head on his shoulders for one so old.  I wish I were having tea with his - and my - favorite lecturer this afternoon instead of with Charley.

      I hope your visit to Hastings is satisfactory.  Today I am going to make an appointment with Penguin Books - you remember I wrote - so, perhaps, we shall not be too poor soon.  I feel hopeful...Perhaps we  shall soon have the whole place prettily furnished.
      Here is a oem for you, dearest:
      The solemn ornaments
      Of autumn or the peaches
      Red in the cage of white
      Are not exclusive forms
      But shaped by chance and will:
      A melon for the hips,
      And grapes held by your toes.

      Topography and speech
      Are analogical,
      Betray the state of feeling -
      The lover in his tree
      Or revolutions.
      My adjectival symbols

      II
      Good for Mr Hanley:  he has a wise head on his
      shoulders for one so old.  I wish I were having
      tea with his - and my - favorite lecturer this af-
      ternoon instead of with Charley.

      Which should I do first, give Ricky hell about
      the frame - or tell him about your sideboard?

      I hope your visit to Hastings is satifactory.
      Today I am going t make an appointment with Pen-
      guin Books - you remember I wrote - so, perhaps,
      we shall not me soo poor soon.  I feel hopeful...
      Perhaps we shall soon have the whole place prettily
      furnished.

      Here is a poem for you, dearest:

      The solemn ornaments
      Or autumn or the peaches
      Red in the cage of white
      Are not exclusive forms
      But shaped by chance and will:
      A melon for the hips,
      And grapes held by your toes.

      Topography and speech
      Are analogical,
      Betray the state of feeling -
      The lover in his tree
      Or revolutions.
      My adjectival symbols
      Attach to Sylvia

      I love you
      Lawrence
