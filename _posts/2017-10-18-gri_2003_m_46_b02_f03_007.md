      "The Aubreys" is admirable: the bed most comfortable and the food first rate. Eggs and meat are plentiful. Keeping irregular times I only see the other guests occasionally: there is a woman with, apparently, three feet; two men who are still, five years after, shouting their army experience at one another. The rest I forget.

      Eight people came to the exhibition
      yesterday, four of these while I was at tea!
      I hope for more such days: I did some Hogarth,
      the letters I mentioned, and skipped through
      that charming book about 5 [unclear]pode[/unclear] blue-&-
      white we looked at in the library. Also
      I bought (at tea-time) some pants and some
      vanishing cream.
      "The Aubreys" is admirable: the bed most
      comfortable and the food first rate. Eggs
      and meat are plentiful. Keeping irregular
      times I only see the other guests occasionally:
      there is a woman with, apparently, three feet;
      two men who are still, five years after,
      shouting their army experiences at one an-
      other. The rest I forget.
      When you are next in Hastings be sure
      to see if those Wedgewood plates are still
      available, darling. The antique shops in
      Harpenden are all totally useless and
      'olde worlde'.
