      Dearest Lawrence.
      I enclose my article "On Painting out-of-doors" which is approximately 1000 words. I hope you approve of it - [unclear]Tissy[/unclear] and [unclear]Mr.[/unclear] like it - though [unclear]Mr.[/unclear] thinks that in the last paragraph I underestimate the interest of the public in the arts - but that I think is not very important. I made a rough draught of a letter to Gainsborough which I also enclose. With suggestions for illustrations. The first is a picture of Cezanne in his prime [unclear]Striding[/unclear] along with his box on his back
