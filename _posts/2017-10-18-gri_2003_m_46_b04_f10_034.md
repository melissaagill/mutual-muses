      as I feel depressed about not having a job and rather anxious. So instead of using my free time to work I have rather wasted it. I have no control over this state-of-mind which will pass off when I can get a job. Or when I see you, which will be first.

      My application to Norwich was unsuccessful, I'm sorry to say. Still no news from the Tate Gallery.

      This is rather a poor letter I'm afraid. Almost every sentence begins with the first person singular. Another letter tomorrow from me will, I hope, be more readable. Finally one more sentence beginning in the same way -

      I love you
      Lawrence

      Norwich was unsuccess-<br/>ful, I'm sorry to say.  Still no news from the Tate
      Gallery.<br/>This is rather a poor letter, I'm afraid. <br/>Almost every sentence
      begins with the first<br/>person singular.  Another letter tomorrow<br/>from
      me will, I hope, be more readable.<br/>Finally one more sentence beginning in<br/>the
      same way--<br/>I love you.<br/>Lawrence
