      yesterday and to-day - and also made some marmalade To-morrow the Shewells come to dinner!
      I expect I shall have to go to Hastings to-morrow Clifford located a pineapple but the shop was closed. I have painted the Masson quite a bit of the table, an orange and lemon and some grapes to-day - before I can work on the back-ground I need to "place" the pine-apple.
      I hope your 2 lectures go well on Saturday and that you are not too tired. Look after-yourself the weather is going to be colder again I understand - do cream your face!
