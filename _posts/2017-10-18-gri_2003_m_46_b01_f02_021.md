      I know it's a bad drawing but they are admirable in letters after all, Sylvia.

      I've got a charming book of Mallarmes' 'Vers de Circonstance': full of [unclear]eventails[/unclear], [unclear]sebums[/unclear], and oeufs de Paques.  Soon its influence will be seen (again) in my poems to you.  So far I have this sononette:

      Fire rots a rose
      stabbed on the altar
      Where Venus' feet
      Had a bird's perseverance

      My sacrifice ensures
      Benevolent days
      Spent on the couch
      And [unclear]sabile[/unclear] games of [unclear]geese[/unclear]

      Ensures as well
      A passionate summer
      Full of secrets
      Full of roses
      Which sacrificed will steal
      every last minute from desire

      At the back of mind was a picture of [unclear]Frogovand[/unclear] in which an elabroate ceremony is performed about an altar on which lies, focus of great beams of light, a rose.

      In the galleries I have seen a selection of modern stuff, Picasso, Metzinger, Soutine, [unclear]Boudant[/unclear] (inevitably); Dufy, and an interesting new painter, [unclear]Lansleay[/unclear], full of savage color.  There is a tendency toward a cubist-jaune tendency at present.  I doubt it will work. (Also about a 6 wallaces.)

      I'm glad we had that Easter Egg together last Friday. [unclear]I C[/unclear] is a [unclear]cing[/unclear] which breaks the sadness of this festival without you. Lots of suitably fluffy birds & [unclear]wrought[/unclear] [unclear]elucalate[/unclear] in the slaps.

      I miss you, miss you, miss you, miss you, miss you, miss you.

      Remember me [unclear]fondly[/unclear] to Michael.  If there is anything he wants to know about conditions here do let me know & I'll try to help.

      I love you.
      Lawrence

      I know it's a bad drawing but they are admirable in letters after all, Sylvia.

      I've got a charming book of Mallarme's 'Vers de Circonstance': full of  Eventails, Alliums, and OEufs de Paques. Soon its influence will be seen (again) in my poems to you. I have this [unclear]sononette[/unclear]:
      Fire rots a rose
      Stabbed on the altar
      Where Venus' feet
      Had bind's preserve once

      My sacrifice ensures
      Benevolent days
      Spent on the couch
      And subtle games of flesh

      Ensures as well
      A passionate summer
      Full of secrets
      Full of roses
      Which sacrificed will steal
      every last minute from desire

      At the back of my mind was a picture & Fragonard in which an elaborate ceremony is performed about an altar on which lies, focus of great beams of light, a rose.
      In the galleries I have seen a selection of modern stuff, Picasso, Metzinger, Soutine, Bauchant (inevitably); Dufy, and an interesting new painter, Lanskoy, full of savage color. There is a tendency toward a cubist - fauve tendency at present. I doubt it will work. (also about 6 large [unclear]Maillols[/unclear].)
      I'm glad we had that Easter Egg together last Friday. It is a tiny thing which breaks the sadness of their festival without you. Lots of suitably fluffy binds & wrought chocolate in the shops
      I miss you, miss you, miss you, miss you, miss you, miss you. Remember me kindly to Michael. If there is anything he wants to know about conditions here do let me know & Ill try to help.
      I love you.
      Lawrence
