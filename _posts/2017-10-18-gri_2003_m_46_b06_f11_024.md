      It was not the purpose of the Bauhaus to train specialists but to provide sound, broad foundations for the student's personal work.  Klee fitted this pattern by offering in the Sketchbook 'basic clarities and points of departure'.  The Bauhaus ideal of educating the individual in the interests of the community was obviously in Klee's mind when he wrote in a lecture (published in 1925): 'The people are not with us. But we seek a people. We began over at the Bauhaus'.  On the other hand, a weaker point in the Bauhaus structure was Gropius' belief in the possibility of a total-work of art, an architectural rather than a musical composite but basically a Wagnerian fancy.
      Giedion relates Klee with Bauhaus from another angle.  He points out that the Pedagogical Sketchbook is shaped by concerns similar to those working in the technical parts of the school. In Klee's theory 'everything is the outcome of movement' (2), and technological movement - from adjustable furniture to the gestures of the assembly line - occupied the technicians.  Though Moholy Nagy has been represented as the Bauhaus 'champion of youth' (3) compared to the fuddy-duddy mystics Klee and Kandinski, both in their 40s, the fundamental link is there.  As early as 1919 Klee was concerned the 'the dynamics and psychology of lines' and defined rest as 'an accidental obstruction of matter' (4).

      It was not the purpose of the Bauhaus to
      train specialists but to provide sound, broad foundations for
      the student's personal work. Klee fitted this pattern by of-
      fering in the Sketchbook 'basic clarities and points of depart-
      ure'. The Bauhaus ideal of educating the individual in the
      interests of the community was obviously in Klee's mind when
      he wrote in a lecture (published in 1925): 'The people are
      not with us. But we seek a people. We began over at the
      Bauhaus'. On the other hand, a weaker point in the Bauhaus
      structure was Gropius' belief in the possibility of a total-work
      of art, an architectural rather than a musical composite but bas-
      ically a Wagnerian fancy.

      He points out that the Pedagogial Sketchbook is shaped by con-
      cerns similar to those working in the technical parts of the
      school. In Klee's theory 'everything is the outcome of move-
      ment' (2), and technological movement - from adjustable furni-
      ture to the gesture of the assemby line - occupied the tec-
      hnicians. Though Moholy Nagy has been represented as the Bau-
      haus 'champion of youth' (3) compared to the fuddy-buddy mystics
      Klee and Kadinski, both in their 40s, the fundamental link is
      there. As early as 1919 Klee was concerned with 'the dynamics
      and psychology of lines' and defined rest as 'an accidental ob-
      struction of matter' (4).
