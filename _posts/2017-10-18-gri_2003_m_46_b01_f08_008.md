      Dearest Sylvia,

      I remember when some of your letters used to be written in the Hastings Reference Library. Mine, today is being written in the B.M. The immense dome of the reading room rises above me. The B.M. clock has just struck eleven. I think it is fast. I make it only five minutes to. Sunlight is breaking in here despite a very bad start. What is it like at Pelt? We have had two winterish days. What, I wonder, are you doing at this time? The students and scholars around me are rather depressing and I am confirmed in my resolve not be become a permanent art historian. I mmust devote myself to poetry for a while when Hogarth is done. I feel with you as my subject inspiration is inexhaustible. I have got the [unclear]Pavorsky[/unclear] references to Titian and I will include them in my next letter. They are very rich in poetic suggestions. On Saturday I went through a ten years file of Burlington Magazines and noted several articles and letters and attributions about [unclear]Giorgions[/unclear] over the years. You must not neglect that source of information. In one Kenneth Clark quotes from Tebaldo. I went to Hampton Court yesterday with Dennis and in three hours we had only got as far round as the Kent dining hall we studied the pictures so closely. One day I'd like to give a talk on [unclear]Iacopo[/unclear] Barano. You know Johnson sold me 50 Swiss francs - worth about 2..18. He wanted to charge me 3..10 - apparently because it was a semi-black market deal. He didn't say frankly he wanted to make 12s. out of 70s. from me but called it a 'fair price'. I protested and he said he didn't want to haggle but gave me 55 of the 3..10 rate which was better! What do you think of that? I must stop now and I shall post this at lunch time. I hope for news from you, my love.

      library mine today is being written in the B.M.  The immense dome of the reading
      room rises above me the B.M. clock has just struck 11,  I think it is fast I
      make it only nine minutes to.  Sunlight is [unclear] in here despite a very
      bad start. What is it like at Pett? We have had two wintry days. What I wonder
      are you doing at this time? The students and \"scholars\" around me are rather
      depressing and I am confirmed in my resolve not to become a permanent artist
      historian.  I must devote myself to poetry for awhile when [unclear) arts is
      done. I feel with you as my subject inspiration is inexhaustible.  I have got
      the parovski  references to Titian and I  will include them in my next letter.
      They are very rich in poetic suggestions. On Saturday I went through a 10 year
      file of Barrlingtons magazines  and rated several articles and letters and attributions
      about Giorgione  over the years you must not neglect that source of information
      in one Kenneth Clark quotes from tebaldo.  I went to Hampton Court yesterday
      with Dennis and in  The rooms we only got as far round as the Kent dining hall
      we studied the pictures so closely. One day I'd like to give a talk on Jacapo
      Bassano.   You know Johnson sold me 50 Swiss franks worth about £2.18 p he wanted
      to charge me £3.10 p --  apparently because it was a semi black market deal.
      \ He didn't say [unclear) he wanted to make 12s out of 10s from me  but called
      it a nice price!  I protested and he said he didn't want to haggle but gave
      me 55 at the £3.10 rate which was better! What do you think of that.  I must
      stop now and I shall post this at lunchtime. I hope for news from you, my love
      Lawrence "
