      Dearest Sylvia
      I am afraid seeing M's parents must have an effort for you. But I am so pleased that Georgie is so full of kindness towards you. (I do admire her - I must say - despite her connections with the Theatre.)
      It is good news that you are sleeping well. I am, too. Though I am on my way to town now, I did not get up til 11.00 and lazed during the morning. I hadn't really tired but anything else was physically impossible. I feel better for it.
      Art News & Review want to review an exh. of children's art. I am not sure if I have time - though I shall try to find time. You know me.
      I was interested in your proposals about the flat at Chepston Road. But as you say - let's wait until we hear from Darrett.
      Ricky is still in hospital : the operation is again postponed. Probably next week. They cannot operate until the inflamation goes down. It is going down, I am glad to say. It isn't certain that they can get the shrapnel & rotting cloth out, however : the latter is what causes the trouble. Molly is still at No 11.
