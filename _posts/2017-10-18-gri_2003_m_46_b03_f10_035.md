      rent. Therefore most of the [unclear]$34..18..10[/unclear] has to go straight

      National Gallery will pay me [unclear]$8[/unclear] at the beginning of December, so,
      my love, you can, I hope, come here soon. (Do you know, by the way,
      when your tenant is leaving?) I am cheered by this sum and lovingly
      anticipate seeing you after this agonizingly prolonged separation.

      Tell Tiny I am on the list of electors this time. Also that I will
      send her dress material shortly. Father tells me [unclear]Partisa Review[/unclear] is
      still coming but  he thinks he has managed to stop it at last. [unclear]Oh &[/unclear]
      I've ordered the Burlington for M.

      The 2 sonnets that I wrote yesterday for you my love are but a
      [unclear][/unclear] of many that are ripening. I really have a large mass of
      chrysanthemums such as I describe - for Frances offered them
      to me & I was glad to accept. The other 2 poems were written
      some time ago & mislaid so I send them to you now.

      Is it not foggy? Paul Santley has invited me to a meal &
      then, to a concert of chamber music in the evening. I think I
      shall go despite the fog. I stayed in yesterday & intend to stay
      in tomorrow so, today, I shall be a gay lion.

      I am reading Wolfflin's Art of the Italian Renaissance - a 50
      year old 'fundamental' book. I have finished Psychotic Art
      (the Goya part is interesting & I've made notes for you).

      By the way, did I say that your pictures were both comfortably
      hung at eye level? Once again congratulations

      Blackheath
      Sunday
      Dearest Sylvia
      The Arts Council have paid me for some of my lectures but as you
      remember I had arranged for a temporary overdraft to meet the
      rent.  Therefore of the 34...8..1 has to go straight
      into the bank.  But they owe me still about 16...6..0 and the
      National Gallery will pay me 8 at the beginning of December, so,
      my love, you can, I hope, come here soon.  (Do you know, by the way,
      when your tenant is leaving?)  I am cheered by this sum and lovingly
      anticipate seeing you after this agonizingly prolonged separation.
      Tell Tiny I am on the list of electors this time.  Also that I will
      send her dress material shortly.  Father tells me Parisian Review is
      still coming but he thinks he has managed to stop it at last.  Oh &
      I've ordered the Burlington for M.
      The 2 sonnets that I wrote yesterday for you my love are but a
      scant[unclear][/unclear] of many that are ripening.  I really have a large mass of
      chrysanthemums such as I describe - for Frances offered them
      to me & I was glad to accept.  The atlas 2 poems were written
      some time ago & mislaid so I send them to you now.
      Is it not foggy?  Paul Southley has invited me to a meal &,
      hen, to a concert of chamber music in the evening.  I think I
      shall go despite the fog.  I stayed in yesterday & intend to stay
      in tomorrow so, today, I shall be a gay lion.
      I am reading Walflin's Art of the Italian Renaissance - a 50
      year old 'fundamental' book,  I have finished Psychotic Art
      (the Goya[unclear][/unclear] part is interesting & I've made notes for you).
      By the way, did I say that your pictures were both comfortably
      hung at eye level?  Once again congratulations
      I love you
      Lawrence
