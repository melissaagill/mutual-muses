      Dearest Sylvia
      Good news, good news indeed that you are painting again. I like the way you put it - that you are christening your studio, with the 2 still life paintings. Your choice of flowers sounds delicious.
      I have no news, except my lectures are going pleasantly & that I am busy on my course.
      Kind Hearts & Coronets wears very well. I liked it as much this time as ever before (except that I missed you). I think it is the funniest ever British film. There's a new film I am dying to see: a Western called Shane.
      Speaking of films, Hamilton-[unclear]Frane[/unclear] & his sister have some interesting theories about the symbols of Les Enfants Terribles. As a brother/sister act themselves they ought to know!
