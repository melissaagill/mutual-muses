      5th August 1953
      My Dearest Sylvia:
      First let me say thank you for my weekend which I so much enjoyed. I hope you did, too, even tho' you were a little tired. I am glad that you had Jack & MJ with you on the return journey: they became very jolly on the platform.
      Do tell me when Dawn breaks at the Rectory - Thursday or Friday, and how work goes on your paintings. I like your new studio so much. I am sure you will paint many fine and characteristic works there. How smart you are - a studio with carpets.
      What - I wonder - will you do today: work in the studio, do the nude's background, or go to Rye? I know what I must do - get my Rubens lecture finally ready.
      The decorators are at work inside the house at present - bare boards, stripped walls, and so on. Every sound crashes through the stairwell. They seem to be saving the porch (as indeed they should).
      I didn't sleep well last night away from you.

      5th August 1953

      My dearest Sylvia:
      First let me say thank you for my weekend
      which I so much enjoyed. I hope you did, too,
      even tho' you were a little tired. I am glad
      that you had Jack & MJ with you on the re-
      turn journey: they became very jolly on
      the platform.
      Do tell me when Dawn breaks at the Rectory -
      Thursday or Friday, and how work goes on
      your painting. I like your new studio so
      much. I am sure you will paint many fine
      and characteristic works there. How smart
      you are - a studio with carpets.
      What - I wonder - will you do today: work
      in the studio, do the nude's background, or
      go to Rye? I know what I must do - get
      my Ruben's lecture finally ready.
      The decorators are at work inside the house
      at present - bare boards, stripped walls,
      and so on. Every sound washes through
      the stairwell. They seem to be saving the porch
      (as indeed the should).
      I didn't sleep well last night away from you.

      you for my weekend which I so much enjoyed. I hope you did, too, even tho' you
      were a little tired. I am glad that you had Jack and MJ with you on the return
      journey: they became very jolly on the platform.\nDo tell me when Dawn breaks
      at the Rectory - Thursday or Friday, and how work goes on your paintings. I
      like your new studio so much. I am sure you will paint many fine and characteristic
      works there. How smart you are - a studio with carpets.\nWhat - I wonder - will
      you do today : work in the studio, do the nude's background, or go to Rye? I
      know what I must do - get my Rubens' lecture finally ready.\nThe decorators
      are at work inside the house at present, bare boards, stripped walls, and so
      on. Every sound crashes through the stair well. They seem to be saving the porch
      (as indeed they should).\nI didn't sleep well last night away from you."
