      Fontana del Biancone it was which suggested my poem.
      Do you know it?  My picture looks something like this:

      She is in bronze, while Neptune in in stone so he
      appears very white against the [unclear]note[/unclear]!

      Lastly here is a poem which I have just finished
      writing.

      Green Adonis never knew
      Who the panting beauty was
      Eloquent in speech and flesh
      That his innocence defeated

      Red Adonis bleeding bleeding
      Goared by the hunted boar
      The blood is emblem of his guilt
      All are guilty who kill love

      O had the goddess him persuaded
      We should not have seen this death
      We who love and know that Venus
      Cannot be despised with safety

      The moral is Freudian, and the expression mytho-
      logical.

      I love, Sylvia, I love you.
      Lawrence

      P.S. [unclear]Bines[/unclear] has [unclear]unfirmed[/unclear] the 12 Ch.

      I love you.  L.
