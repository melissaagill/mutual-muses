      you, yours, as you say, is empowered by later experiences.  But though the processes are contrary they serve the one function of cementing us yet more firmly. (I shall try and [unclear] versify[/unclear] this if I can.)  Your words about Hogarth are encouraging and they have revived my interest in him.  I shall resume this letter tomorrow as it is time I put the light out. I hope you are sleeping well Sylvia.  What shall I dream about: a Princess [unclear]bee[/unclear] with her sonnet on her head, dressed in a charming new stanza with alternate rhymes. A negro page will don her with a villanelle and her feet will rest daintily on a rounded. There will be a triolet on her fingers and, just possibly, a couplet at the waist. I love you, Sylvia, my dream.
           I have just had breakfast and soon it will be eleven o'clock.  I must be off shortly to the V and A. So I will stop at the end of this page, and send it off. In the space left I must tell you again, and in the same old terms, I'm afraid, how much I love you. Even when we are apart I feel you existing as a part of me and serving me a purpose so that I feel I am making use of my liberty. Living is inconceivable with you not loving me as I would sink into another [unclear] slough[/unclear] of autumn. Symbolically at least this is summer for me though a cold wind flusters the trees. I love you so much.
