      AHA, WHO?

      Obscurity belongs to poets
      Who do not always know
      The animal in the fingers cage,
      The real sound effect of a page
      Crossed by sighs of sails that grow
      (In wind) like flower - the girls of poets.

      Obscurity is shared by you
      My reader and implicit muse
      Unless you can put this poem in your hat
      And take a poet by his ear from it.
      The conjuring tricks of owls is known to you
      Who make of their "hows" a sound like "who's".

      Who's indeed this unsigned poem
      From a poet, sent by love.
      The snow is tinsel on a heart,
      The veil is snow upon a belle:
      The mask is the work of a white owl
      Whose wings criss cross above
      The known-obscure part
      Played by someone in the anonymous poem.

      AHA, WHO?
      Obscurity belong to poets
      who do not always know
      the animal in the finger's cage,
      the real sound effect of a page
      crossed by sighs of sails that grow
      (in wind) like flowers- the girls of poets.
      Obscurity is share by you
      my reader and implicit muse
      unless you can put this poem in your hat
      and take a poet by his ears from it.
      The conjuring tricks of owls is known to you
      who make of their 'hows' a sound like 'who's'.
      Who's indeed this unsigned poem
      from a poet, sent by love.
      The snow is tinsel on a heart,
      the veil is snow upon a belle:
      the mask is the work of a white owl
      whose wings crisscross above
      the known-obscure part
      played by someone in the
      anonymous poem.
      for Sylvia: 14th February, MCMLII
