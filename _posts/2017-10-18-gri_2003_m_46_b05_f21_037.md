      on the  [unclear][/unclear] R. & A. and finished them. On looking at the painting I think I have been a good deal influenced by [unclear][/unclear]. It was that strange picture we saw in the Academy and his Ciece-not the one in the Borghese, but one I've only seen a reproduction of. I shall go blackberrying when I have posted this-then do some more work on the pear-tree. And perhaps the still life.
      Look after yourself, my love. I adore you and am longing to see you. Let me know when you are coming.
      Tiny is very kind and all is very well at present which makes me happy. She is going away next week to Eastbourne but will be back before you go. I shall be able to get everything to rights next week!
      I adore you my angel-and think of you all the time. I love you. Sylvia

      on the flowers in R. & A. and finished them. On looking at the painting I think I have been a good deal influenced by  it was that strange picture we saw in the Academy, and his Circe - not the one in the Borghese, but one I've only seen a reproduction of. I shall go blackberrying when I have posted this - then do some more work on the pear-tree, and perhaps the still life.
      Look after yourself my love - I adore you and am longing to see you. Let me know when you are coming.
      Tiny is very kind and all is very well at present which makes me happy - she is going away next week to Eastbourne but will be back before you go. I shall be able to get everything to rights next week!
      I adore you my angel - and think of you all the time. I love you Sylvia
