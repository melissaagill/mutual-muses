      London [unclear][/unclear] ' 50

      Dear Sylivia
      My parents came last night - enjoyed themselves I think - though did not help me with the washing up - and I had used everything.  They did not notice the bookcase for some time !  Your pictures are out of their hiding -places again now.
      I am trapped - sans coat - at the post office [unclear] between[/unclear] a NG & Charing X, by a downpour.  Yesterday, however, was splendid - I do hope you were able to paint.
      [unclear]Holdens[/unclear] - I hear - are planning to [unclear] [/unclear] Hogarth away this forthcoming books.  Shall I call it Hogarth's Progress - if not what ?

      I shall go to the Redfern this week - though not, I expect, today as my lecture will not be over till tea-time.
      Are there any signs of The Grand Manner drafts ?  I am sorry to bother you about it - it is only the result of my taking seriously your exhortation to get the complete MSS off.
      I am sleeping rather poorly at present so I am able to think of you all night, or nearly, as well as all day - visions of you consoling to [unclear][/unclear] dark.  How are you sleeping ?  I do hope soundly.
      [unclear][/unclear] carrying the book case[unclear][/unclear] the other day.
      I love you
      Lawrence

      Dearest Sylvia
      My parents came last night - enjoyed themselves I think - though did not help me with the washing up - and I had used everything. They did not notice the bookcase for some time! Your pictures are out of their hiding-places again now.
      I am trapped - sans coat - at the post office between the NG & Charing X, by a downpour. Yesterday, however, was splendid - I do hope you were able to paint.
      Hodders - I hear - are planning to announce Hogarth abmong their forthcoming books. Shall I call it Hogarth's Progess - if not what?
      I shall go to the Redfern this week - though not, I expect, today as my lecture will not be over till tea-time.
      Are there signs of The Grand Manner chapter? I am sorry to bother you about it - it is only the result of my taking seriously your exhortations to get the complete MSS off.
      I am sleeping rather poorly at present so I am able to think of you all night, or nearly, as well as all day - visions of you consoling the restless dark. How are you sleeping? I do hope soundly.
      Dandy carrying the bookcase home the other day.
      I love you
