      2    poems, and so happy that you enjoyed
      your stay here.  I hope so much that
      we shall find some reason for you to come
      again.  I do look forward to Thursday
      the 26th.  I shall be devastated if
      Mrs. Cregan cannot change with you.
      I hope that all your lectures go well,
      tell me about them.  I wish I could
      hear the Frances Hodgkins this afternoon.
      The only bright spot in Art News for me
      was to read your name so often in the
      list of lectures.
      I am delighted that you found the shoes
      and sorry that you had to "traypuss"
      about so much. I hope they prove
      satisfactory--they will save your
      winter shoes.  I am so glad you got
      some sun and air in the garden.
      Thank you for the nice drawing of Dandy.
      I worked on Clifford yesterday as I
      said.  I did his hips hand and
      knee and am very pleased.
      This morning I worked in the garden
      but the weather was so heavy that I
      did less than I had hoped.
