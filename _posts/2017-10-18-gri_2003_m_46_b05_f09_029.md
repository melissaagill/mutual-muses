      19 ix 52
      Dearest Sylvia,
      I am so glad to hear your painting is going well.
      What a pleasure it will be to see your new work
      on the 26th.  If as you say, I will not be
      coming until late I shall not wait for him,
      but come down during the morning.  Yes, I
      think that I should leave on Wednesday 1st
      as I have to be at Lincoln on 2nd, for I have
      to get slides from the V and A, as well as
      a few charter.
      C sent me a charming cat card ('Tiny Tots
      Trio') and Molly sent me a card which de-
      lights Trumpet--for it shows an elephant
      racing along with parcels in his trunk and
      flames in his hand.
      (Good heavens:  I nearly forgot.  I have
      a lecture at Banstead on the evening of 1st
      also...so I must return then!)
      I enclose my birthday poem, or some
      of it.  I think I shall have to leave it
      as it is for the moment.  As it stands it
      is an attempt to objectify 2 aspects of
      The Poet in the Past.  Time is against verse

      19 IX '52
      Dearest Sylvia,
      I am so glad to hear that you painting is going well. What a pleasure it will be to see your new work on the 26th. If as you say, C will not be coming until late I shall not wait for him. but come down during the morning. Yes, I think that I should leave on Wednesday 1st as I have to be at Lincoln on 2nd, for I have to get slides from the V and A, as well as a few clothes.
      C sent me a charming cat card ('Tiny Tots Trio') and Molly sent me a card which delights Trumpet - for it shows an elephant racing along with parcels in his trunk & flowers in his hand.
      (Good heavens: I nearly forgot. I have a lecture at Banstead on the evening of 1st also .... So I must return then!)
      I enclose my birth-day poem, or some of it. I think I shall have to leave it as it is for the moment. As it stands it is an attempt to objectify 2 aspects of The Poet in the Past. Time is against verse
