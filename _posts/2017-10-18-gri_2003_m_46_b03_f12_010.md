      Dearest Lawrence
      I enclose 2 cuttings from "the Times" one bad review of "the Cock-tail Party" with a fine quotation for the "Fallacy of height"; "grave and high beauty"! and from the same paper an amusing piece of information about Lewis Carrol.
      I shall arrive on Tuesday by bus at the usual time and shall get my tickets tomorrow.
      I have no news otherwise my darling, except that the Woods begin their holiday on the 22nd of May - a Monday - I hope we shall be able to arrange a meeting. They are going to the "Cocktail Part" and The [unclear]Rnonthl?[/unclear])
      I love you my darling - My Apollo.
      Love Sylvia
