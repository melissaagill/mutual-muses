      4    towards almond-shaped, sathe melan-
      coly expression.  I managed it
      prop the easle up with 2
      legs on the sofa and me on the
      floor so that I could ppose and
      paint--just about.  I hope
      to do a lot more tomorrow.
      I watered the garden, not really
      believing it would rain, it did
      long and heavily.  I was sorry
      because they had cut the corn in
      the field behind us, but there has
      be a strong wind again today
      and as it is on the side of the
      hill it will dry it.
      I see there is a photograph of
      the Greenwich cycling from Pevesnere
      new book.
      I tried "Ulysses" again last night
      this time I understand it and
      am enjoying it very much.  I
      seem to need to read it at least
      twice.  I do admire him! (Joyce)
