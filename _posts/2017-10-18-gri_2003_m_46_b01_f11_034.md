      Wimbledon.

      13th December.

      Dearest Sylvia,

      I am writing immediately after
      speaking to you. I am so unhappy
      that you have been poorly but am
      cheered at your recovering now. I
      am sending this letter with your
      owls who declared, on hearing the
      news, they must visit you. They
      take each a kiss and a hug of the
      wing for you.

      This morning I shall see an address
      I have. then this afternoon the
      B.M. where I am writing about book
      illustrations by H. which are very
      amusing. They make me value your
      Homer more than ever. Tonight I
      am going to see Rosenau: she invit-
      ed me last week but I said no but now
      I shall go.

      About David: the catalogues were
      sold out last Sunday (!) but when I go
      again (I've been twice) I will get you
      one if they are available again. Ros-
      enau's lecture on David was good - so
      much better than her book oddly enough.
