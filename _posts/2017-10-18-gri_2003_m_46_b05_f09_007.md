      Wimbledon   Thursday    [11-9-52]
      Dearest Sylvia
      The radio is on. Kay Starr (I think that's her name) is singing : 'Come on'a my house. I'm gonna give you candy, I'm gonna give you everything. Give you a peach and a pomegranate'. Studies in Iconography in what can only be described as Tin Pan Alley!
      However Dandy is not only listening to nonsense - he is reading it also. I am half-way through 6 Existentialist Thinkers: so far I have read about Kierkegaard, [unclear]Wietzzele[/unclear], and Jaspers: I have Marcel, Hei-digger, & Sartre to go. Seriously some excellent points emerge. For instance, Nietzsche says it is no good expecting x-ianity just to fade out like the belief in fairies - it is too involved in our whole culture for that. N hated x-ianity. The only way to get rid of it would be by a total rejection perpetually renewed. Surely we in 1952 see he was right? It is the rationalist error to think it could be overcome by a mere accumulation of facts against it. There are some long quotations from Kierkegaard: he is an enchanting writer, a brilliant ironist (I see where Auden gets it).
      I am getting on with my lecture notes" I am reading Groddeck who is better than I expected. His Symbolism in Language & Art is especially useful to me at present (notably the section on Wagner's Ring). Wimbledon library has also yielded Jones' 2 vols of Essays in Applied Psycho-Analysis as well as a collection of essays including Kris on Approaches To Art. I hope that my letter is not turning into lecture-notes or a book-lovers guide to something or other but I must quote Groddeck on Birthdays: 'To have a birthday, & for 24 hours be lord of the earth! Yet there are people who say they care not a jot about birthday= exiled monarchs, whose kingdoms were lost in childhood!'
      Incidentally I am writing a birthday poem - surveying the past and the present, those before we met and those since.
      Are you being able to paint as you would wish? The weather here is milder and sunny now.

      The radio is on - Kay Starr (I think that's her name) is singing: 'come on' in
      my house. I'm gonna give you candy, I'm gonna give you everything.
      Give you a peach and a pomegranate. Studies in Iconography in what
      can only be described as Tin Pan Alley!

      However Dandy is not only listening to nonsence - he is reading it
      also. I am half-way through 6. Existentialist Thinkers: so far I have
      read about Kierhegaard Wietzsche, and Jaspers: I have Marcel, Hei-
      digger, & Sartre to go. Seriously some excellent points emerge. For
      instance, Nietzsche says it is no good expecting X-ianity just to fade out
      like the belief in fairies - it is too involved in our whole culture for
      that. N hated x-ianity. The only way to get rid of it would be by a

      mere accumulation of facts against it. There are some long
      quotations from Kierhegaard: he is an enchanting writer, a brilliant
      ironist (I see where Anden gets it).

      I am getting on with my lecture rates: I am reading Groddeck
      who is better than I expected. His Symbolian in Language & Art
      is especially useful to me at present (notably the section on
      Wagner's Ring). Wimbedon library has also yielded Jones' 2 vols
      of Essays in Applied Psycho-Analysis as well as a collection of
      essays including Kris on Approaches To Art. I hope that my letter
      is not turning into lecture-notes or a book-lovers guide to
      something or other but I must quote Graddeck on Birthdays: 'To have
      a birthday, & for 24 hours be lord of the earth! Yet there are
      people who say they care not a jot about birthday: exciled
      monarchs, whose kingdom were lost in childhood!'

      Wimbledon Thursday [11-9-52]
      Dearest Sylvia
      The radio is on. Kay Starr (I think that's her name) is singing: 'Come on'a
      my house. I'm gonna give you candy, I'm gonna give you everything.
      Give you a peach and a pomegranate'. Studies in Iconography in what
      can only be described as Tin Pan Alley!
      However Dandy is not only listening to nonsense - he is reading it
      also. I am half-way through 6 Existentialist Thinkers: so far I have
      read about Kierkegaard, Nietzsche, and Jaspers: I have Marcel, Hei-
      digger, & Sartre to go. Seriously some excellent points emerge. For
      instance, Nietzsche says it is no good expecting X-ianity just to fade out
      like the belief in fairness - it is too involved in our whole culture for
      that. N hated X-ianity. The only way to get rid of it would be by a
      total rejection perpetually renewed. Surely we in 1952 see he was
      right? It is the rationalist error to think it would be overcome by a
      mere accumulation of facts against it. There are some long
      quotations from Kierkegaard: he is an enchanting writer, a brilliant
      ironist (I see where Auden gets it).
      I am getting on with my lecture notes: I am reading Groddeck
      who is better than I expected. His Symbolism in Language & Art
      is especially useful to me at present (notably the section on
      Wagner's Ring). Wimbledon library has also yielded Jones' 2 vols.
      of Essays in Applied Psycho-Analysis as well as a collection of
      essays including Kris on Approaches to Art. I hope that my letter
      is not turning into lecture-notes or a book-lovers guide to
      something or other but I must quote Groddeck on Birthdays: 'To have
       a birthday, & for 24 hours be lord of the earth! Yet there are
      people who say they care not a jot about birthdays: exiled
      monarchs, whose kingdoms were lost in childhood!'
      Incidentally I am writing a birthday poem - surveying the
      past and the present, those before we met and those since.
      Are you being able to paint as you would wish? The
      weather here is milder and sunny now.
