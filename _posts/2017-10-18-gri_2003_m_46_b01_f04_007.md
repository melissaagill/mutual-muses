      Sunday. My dearest Sylvia: Well I've missed the post. I had forgotten I can't rely on a seven o'clock collection on Sunday. It is six o'clock now and I'm lying on the couch in the lounge. I have more or less finished preparing my lecture notes and I must do some [chartect-live][unclear][/unclear]. Soon, I must, but for the moment some pleasure. Only to you can I say that writing is a pleasure. Thank you for your letter which made me feel vividly [][unclear][/unclear] good fortune in being in the country. PC was a lovely description. Please do include some [//catches][unclear][/unclear]. O you are so fortunate. Your account of hay-making sounded most agreeable. Associations are not easily ahead of a man who reaps hay making [soon][unclear][/unclear] Or give who helps - Familiar or one was fell to him once when Persephone. (Better not show this one to Tiny - the last dime would [Pas sane][unclear][/unclear] be comic.) aided you say rapt in gloom! I'm so sorry. But what can I say except I am so sorry. Try not to become depressed
