      them!  Have you had a reply from Price Jones?
      You seem to be having a very
      busy and exciting time - and
      meeting interesting people - which
      is always useful and stimulating
      I am so glad Melville liked
      your matter article, that is very
      pleasing.
      Thank you for the charming Dandy
      drawings.  It is the next best
      think to seeing him!
      I'm afraid I feel very tired
      again to-day - it is the date!
      I shall try to do more of "Kissing"
      now.
      Have you got the papers for
      the womens show yet?  For
      I wonder if I am allowed
      to send in 2 water-colours
      and an oil?
      I have no other news but
      that Clifford has written 900 for
      you - and now needs the books!
      I long to read your "Orpheus &
      [unclear][/unclear] Poem again - I love you Sylvia
