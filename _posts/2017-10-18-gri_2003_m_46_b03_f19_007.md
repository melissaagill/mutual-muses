      Dearest Lawrence
      What exquisite poems particularly 'the Music at Night' - it is as perfect as a song by Hugo Wolf or Du Pasque. Thank you, dearest one.
      I will come on Saturday if I can - but there is one hitch - Molly is coming for the week-end - I can't very well go away in the middle as it were! But if the weather continues so cold she obviously will not come as it [unclear][/unclear] here and we can't make the [unclear][/unclear] any-where near warm enough for here. I will come on Sunday afternoon if I cannot manage Saturday - I hope I can come on Saturday how-ever.
      I do like "the Navigable profile" and look forward to hearing the poem. I am interested in the magazine in prospect - I hope something will come of it! I look forward to knowing more of the plans.
      You are a naughty Lion for you don't answer my letters!

      Dearest Lawrence

      What exquisite poems particularly
      'the Music at Night' - it is as
      perfect as a song by Hugo Wolf
      on Du Parque. Thank you, dearest one.

      I will come on Saturday if I
      can - but there is one hitch -
      Molly is coming for the week-end -
      I can't very well go away in the
      middle as it were! But if the weather
      continues so cold she obviously
      will not come as it is Arctic here
      and we can't make the house any-
      where near warm enough for her
      I will come on Sunday afternoon
      if I cannot manage Saturday - I
      hope I can come on Saturday how-
      ever.

      I do like "the Navigable profile" and
      look forward to hearing the poem.

      I am interested in the magazine
      in prospect - I hope something will
      come of it! I look forward to
      knowing more of the plans.

      You are a naughty Lion for you
      don't answer my letters!
