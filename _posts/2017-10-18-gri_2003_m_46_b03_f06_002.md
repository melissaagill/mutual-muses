      1st July 1950
      Blackheath
      Dearest Sylvia,

      My previous letter to you was very short I'm afraid but I shall make this letter more adequate.  It is Saturday evening: I have eaten my meat ration, among much else, and pause from critical writing to put down what has been in my mind all day - I love you.  I have quite enjoyed this day at home, after a very busy Friday, and look forward to two more days at Blackheath.  I miss you but I miss no one else and do not feel impelled to ring anybody up, as I used to.  Today I have completed [unclear]Gilpin[/unclear], the [unclear]marisot[/unclear] note (which I enclose in its complete form), and added your observation about Sigimondo as a sequel to the Lady's Last Stake to the psychoanalytical chapter.  I look forward to another day's work tomorrow.

      However, all this is about me.  I hasten to say how glad I am that you have bought your canvas and I look forward very much to news of its progress - from priming onwards.  Omit no stage in its creation, my beauty.  I think it is a very good idea to continue with the subject despite the setback about the church.  I withdraw my suggestion that you paint something classical for clearly that would be a silly compromise with your ideas for the large work.  So I await with great curiosity and excitement more news of this ambitious project.

      I wonder what has happened about Clifford's interview at Oxford.  Do tell me as soon as you know.  I was glad to hear he was cheerful on Thursday evening.  You must have returned in time to outweigh Grace's telephone calls.  Good cat - I'm very pleased.

      I am glad the only too well named Savages are good for something.  (I sound like you talking about Peter Simmons!)  I am sure that you will do a satisfactory portrait for them because they are fond of you and seem appreciative.  Your muse commends the commission and will do his best to make all go smoothly, even at long distance.

      1st July 1950 Blackheath
      Dearest Sylvia
      My previous letter to you was very short I'm afraid but I shall make
      this letter more adequate. It is Saturday evening: I have eaten my
      meat ration, among much else, and pause from critical writing to
      put down what has been in my mind all day - I love you. I have
      quite enjoyed this day at home, after a very busy Friday and look
      forward to two more days at Blackheath. I miss you but I miss no-
      one else and do not feel impelled to ring anybody up, as I used to.
      Today I have completed Gilpin, the Morisot note (which I enclose in its
      completed form), and added your observations about Sigismundo as
      a sequel to The Lady's Last Stake to the psycho-analytical [[?]]. I
      look forward to another day's work tomorrow.
      However, all this is about me. I hasten to say how glad I am that
      you have bought your canvas and I look forward very much to
      news of its progress - from priming onwards. Omit no stage in its
      creation, my beauty. I think it is a very good idea to continue
      with the subject despite the set-back about the church.  I withdraw
      my suggestion that you paint something classical for clearly that
      would be a silly compromise with your ideas for the large work.
      So I await with great curiosity and excitement more news of this
      ambitious project.
      I wonder what has happened about Clifford's interview at Oxford.
      Do tell me as soon as you know. I was glad to hear he was cheer-
      ful on Thursday evening. You must have returned in time to
      outweigh Grace's telephone calls. Good cat - I'm very pleased.
      I am glad the only too-well named Savages are good for something.
      (I sound like you talking about Pete Simmons!) I am sure that you
      will do a satisfactory portrait for them because they are fond
      of you and seem appreciative. Your muse commends the commis-
      sion and will do his best to make all go smoothly, even at long
      distance.
