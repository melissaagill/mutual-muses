      [6-4-53] Easter Monday Blackheath Dearest Sylvia:
      I hope that you had a happy Easter. I thought of you
      constantly and imagined you in various settings at Pett that
      I know so well.

      As for me I will tell you what I have done over the Holiday.
      I enclose part of what I wrote. Also a page about the Garbo film. Carbon copies of the start
      and near-end of my article on Portmanteau films. I have
      written about Michaux' poetry and silent film comedies of
      first decade of 20c. I have written bits and pieces of the
      sculpture article. I have typed most of the poems I have
      written recently, and prepared Tuesday's lecture on The Unknown
      Political Prisoner in which I shall deal with some of the new
      German sculptors.

      I feel a little bit stunned after doing all that so quickly
      and today (though I have been working this morning) I
      am going to meet Paul Harding. We shall see Come Back,
      Little Sheba and then have coffee with Molly.

      Your letter has just come ( or, at least, I have just found it).
      I am sorry your period is bad but awfully glad that it has arrived.

      I have not taken Pengilly's picture back yet. Should I not
      do so, after all?

      I have read Hemingway's To Have and Have Not, a wierd book,
      really terribly bad exept for a few, very few, passages. Although short it seems to go every which way.

      I had coffee with June at the Tate Gallery the other day.
      It seems Alan Reynolds is an old school-friend of hers. He
      lives at Shoreham which is easy to get to by bus from Black-
      heath. She suggests I ought to visit him... I am mildly
      tempted (and that's a fact). It seems he is totally un-
      spoiled by success: doesn't that make him sound priggish?

      This weather. How April can you get? I am glad you were able
      to get that nice walk in. Already this morning 3 bouts of bril-
      liant sun and 2 of torrential rain.

      See you soon. Rest while your period lasts.
      I love you,
      Lawrence

      [6-4-53]
      Blackheath
      Easter Monday
      Dearest Sylvia:
      I hope you have had a happy Easter. I thought of you constantly and imagined you in various settings at Pett that I know so well.
      As for me I will tell you what I have done over the Holiday. I enclose part of what I wrote. (Also a page about the Garbo film.) Carbon copies of the start and near-end of my article on Portmanteau films. I have practically completed the final version now. Also I have written about Michaux' poetry and silent film comedies of first decade of C20th. I have typed most of the poem I have written recently, and prepared Tuesday's lecture on the Unknown Political Prisoner in which I shall deal with some of the new German sculptors.
      I feel a little bit stunned after doing all that so quickly and today (though I have been working this morning) I am going to meet Paul Harding. We shall see Come Back, Little Sheba and then have coffee with Molly.
      Your letter has just come (or, at least, I have just found it). I am sorry your period is bad but awfully glad that it has arrived.
      I have not taken Pengilly's picture back yet. Should I not do so, after all?
      I have read Hemingway's To Have and Have Not, a weird book, really terribly bad except for a few, very few, passages. Although short it seems to go every which way.
      I had coffee with June at the Tate Gallery the other day. It seems Alan Reynolds is an old school friend of hers. He lives at Shoreham which is easy to get to by bus from Blackheath. She suggests I ought to visit him. I am mildly tempted (and that's a fact). It seems he is totally unspoiled by success: doesn't that make him sound priggish?
      This weather. How April can you get? I am glad that you were able to get that nice walk in. Already this morning 3 bouts of brilliant sun and 2 of torrential rain.
      See you soon. Rest while your period lasts
      I love you
      Lawrence
