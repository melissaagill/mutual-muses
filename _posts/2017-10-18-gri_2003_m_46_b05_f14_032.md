      2    but my cold seems to make me slow.
      I had hoped to go to the WI
      pantomime--"Dick Whitington", for which
      I have a ticket, but I don't know
      if I will be able.  This afternoon I
      shall paint.  I had hoped to go to
      Hastings this morning to pay in my
      cheque and buy some grapes for the
      still-life.  I expect I shall go tomorrow.
      I was streaming this morning--I feel
      a little better now.
      I am very pleased with the "1890's"
      and have read over half.  I really must
      read "Dorien Grey" again--and I think
      I should read "A Rebours"!  I think
      that all the so-called modern move-
      ments were born in the 90's!
      Therefore I'm frightfully modern with a
      difference!  I have looked again at
      Beardsley and I do still think
      him very good; he was, and probably
      is a great influence on me!  I
      love patterns and complexities too!
      I hope your Banstead Class went well

      2 but my cold seems to make me slow. I had hoped to go to the W.I. pantomime - "Dick Whittington," for which I have a ticket - but I don't know if I will be able. This afternoon I shall paint. I had hoped to go to Hastings this morning to pay in my cheque and buy some grapes for the still-life. I expect I shall go tomorrow. I was streaming this morning - I feel a little better now.
      I am very pleased with the "1890s" and have read over half - I really must read "Dorian Grey" again - and I think I should read "A Retours"! I think that all the so-called modern movements were born in the "90's"! Therefore I'm frightfully modern with a difference!  have looked again at Beardsley and I do still think him very good; he was, and probably is, a great influence on me! I love pattterns and complexities too!
      I hope your Banstead Class went well
