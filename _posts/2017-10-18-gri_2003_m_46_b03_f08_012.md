      expect the [unclear]Pieso[/unclear] book when it comes out and he would like
      me to review the children's Drawings, which Herbert Read

      By the way, I have bought Measure for Measure from
      Wimbledon - having read so many studies of it I thought

      Dearest Sylvia

      great pleasure - and still does so as i re-read it. I quite
      agree with your advice about borrowing - & Hetty gave Dandy
      lots of advice before she left with you. I am going to the
      bank this morning, then I shall shop, wisely but well, rem-
      embering all the things Hetty & Sylvia told me before they
      went to the country.
      With your charming letter was one from Gainsborough: I can
      expect the Piero book when it comes out and he would like
      me to review the children's Drawings, which Herbert Read
      opens on Friday, you remember.
      By the way, I brought Measure for Measure from
      Wimbledon - having read so many studies of it I thought
      it was about time.
