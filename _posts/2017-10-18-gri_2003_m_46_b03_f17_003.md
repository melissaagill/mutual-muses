      [unclear]Twig[/unclear] sends her best love and thanks
      you for the Swanees. She has just
      paid for P.L.M.A. - she only just could!
      She says that she thought the arrangement
      was that she should pay for them,
      and would lend it to you - you keep -
      if anything you particularly want, and
      that in exchange you should lend her
      Swanee. Each of you eventually keeping
      your own particular magazine - She
      says she has had 2 more nos. of
      Partisan. I said I would bring
      these and the P.L.M.A when I come
      as that will not be long and will save
      postage. But if you need them earlier
      say.
      Clifford has just come in crowned
      with success and asked tenderly after
      you - I gave your messages correctly.
      He has just gone off to have his meal.
      [unclear]Twig[/unclear] is very [unclear]encouraging[/unclear] about my
