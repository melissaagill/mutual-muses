      How I look forward to seeing you again.  It really shouldn't make much difference but I feel much more distant from you than I do at Wimbledon.  I love you, dearest, and anticipate continuing to do so, long enough to refute Clifford's gloomy dogma - for dogma it seems to be.  Possibly even long enough to set all your doubts at rest.

      It is a fine warm morning.  The sun is warm on my bare back as I write.  I am sure the weather will do a lot to ease you (provided it is fine in Sussex).

      Christian bells are clanging away [unclear]varrilly[/unclear] .  So I think I shall devote the morning to the minervan part of my poem in compensation.

      I adore you,
      Lawrence
