      31-8-51  Pett  Dearest Lawrence,
      Thank you for your letter - I
      hope your interview went well I
      wonder if the prospects are at
      all attractive!
      I admit disappointment as
      to the Redfern - one hopes to do
      better each year rather than worse.
      I am quite cynical about galleries
      by now - and although I sometimes
      despair of getting my work shown
      I do not now consider it any criticism
      of my abilities.  I have not as yet
      started anything but am thinking
      over my cafe' decoraton.  I shall
      ask Desiree if she will pose for [unclear]Persphone[/unclear]
      I hope to do a portrait of Desiree -
      Clifford would like to buy one!
      The weather has been really shocking -
      I fear they may have to burn
      the barley crop at Eluis Farm

      your letter.  I<br/>hope your interview went well.  I<br/>wonder if the prospects
      are at<br/>all attractive!<br/>I admit disappointment as<br/>to the Redfern--one
      hopes to do<br/>better each year rather than worse.<br/>I am quite cynical about
      galleries<br/>by now--and although I sometimes<br/>despair of getting my work
      shown<br/>I do not now consider it any criticism<br/>of my abilities.  I have
      not as yet<br/>started anything but am thinking<br/>over my cafe decoration.  I
      shall<br/>ask Desiree if she will pose for Persephone.<br/>I hope to do a portrait
      of Desiree--<br/>Clifford would like to buy one!<br/>The weather has been really
      shocking.<br/>I fear they may have to burn<br/>the barley crop at Elurs Farm
