      2.    Turnbull sounds nice.  I don't suppose
      we'd like my kind of thing--but I
      agree with his idea!
      I'm so glad that your lectures are
      so successful--looking as she does
      Mrs. Cregan deserves to be unpopular--
      by dressing in so slovenly and
      informal a manner she makes her lectures
      appear elementary and unimportant.
      My poor Lion I hope you will not be
      too tired with all those lectures--
      though I am delighted that you have
      them.  Have you an NG public
      one on Saturday?  What ever are the
      3 on Wednesday.  I know Baustead!
      Am I to come on Sunday?  or should
      I come on Saturday evening as I have
      a railway return?  that would make
      for a nice restful Sunday?  Or can
      you not have me at all?  I hope
      you can--but shall quite understand
      if not.
      Your poem delights me.  I shall
      read it in bed tonight!  The second
      verse is particularly nice--Tue
