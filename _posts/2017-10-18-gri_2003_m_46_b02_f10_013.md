      Wednesday
      Dearest Sylvia
      This can only be a short statement of my
      adoration.  In a few moments I am having
      a quick tea with Robert Hart and I have
      just come from Ted's able hands. (He used a
      new preparation on my hair so your lion is
      now 'silky, smooth, and lustrous!)
      This note will tell you what you already
      know - that I love you - and it is yet one
      more [unclear]amorous[/unclear] that, in the most hurried
      of moments, I must write to you [unclear]kuefly[/unclear] notes
      than not write at all.
      I hope that the Woods, the they talk a little
      about Monday, will give you even a fragment
      of the pleasure they gave me talking about you.
      Oh I love you, dear Sylvia - beauty
      who dominates my heart and mind with effortless
      grace -
      How I love you
      Lawrence
