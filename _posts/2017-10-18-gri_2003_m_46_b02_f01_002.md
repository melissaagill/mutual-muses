      1st January 1949 Wimbledon
      Dearest Sylvia,
      You sounded unhappy on the phone and I cannot blame you for I know that leaving Michael will cause you pain. But the fact that you are strong enough to make this decision shows that you know the other side of the picture - the side which shows our love. This decision, despite your allegiance to Michael, is a passionate testament of your love which I treasure even as I feel for your pain. I wish that I could help you now but as soon as we are together I will be able to. Do you remember our talk in Camber Castle with its palm shaped like a clover? There we were confident and happy. Once we are together all the things that seem to wedge us apart will act differently, like a net of Vulcan pressing us closer. Time and Space will be no longer hostile - but attentive as putti to our requirements! But most important is the simple fact of love - expressed in action and speech and feeling - notion clumsily selected words and guarded telephone talks and fragment ripped from the calendar. Our love is strong and moves against the schizophrenic personality of our time: our needs and their expression are one - we fulfill each other. Is this not so?

      ough to make this decision shows that

      decision, despite your allegiance to

      you remember our talk in Camber Castle
      with its plan shaped like a clover?
      There we were confident and happy.
      Once we are together all the things
      that seem to wedge us apart will act
      differently, like a net of Vulcan press-
      ing us closer. Time and Space will
      be no longer hostile - but attentive as

      important is the simple fact of love -

      love is strong and it moves against the

      1st January 1949 Wimbledon
      Dearest Sylvia,

      You sounded unhappy on the phone
      and I cannot blame you for I know that
      leaving Michael will cause you pain.
      But the fact that you are strong en-
      ough to make this decision shows that
      you know the other side of the picture -
      the side which shows our love. This
      decision, despite your allegiance to
      Michael, is a passionate testament of
      your love which I treasure even as I
      feel for your pain. I wish that I
      could help you now but as soon as we
      are together I will be able to. Do
      you remember our talk in Camber Castle
      with its plan shaped like a clover?
      There we were confident and happy.
      Once we are together all the things
      that seem to wedge us apart will act
      differently, like a net of Vulcan press-
      ing us closer. Time and Space will
      be no longer hostile - but attentive as
      putti to our requirements! But most
      important is the simple fact of love -
      expressed in action and speech and feel-
      ing - not in clumsily selected words
      and guarded telephone talks and frag-
      ments ripped from the calendar. Our
      love is strong and it moves against the
      schizophrenic personality of our time:
      our needs and their expression are one-
      we fulfill each other. Is this not so?
