      Ships that [unclear][/unclear] search the coast

      Orson Welles' Macbeth is showing and I hope to see it shortly.

      Here is a poem about evening, with 'we' used collectively for every
      dreamer:

      Like falling trees we swim towards
      The canal springboard of the bed,
      Indifferent to gravity.
      Now mirrors are less confident
      Of the rooms in which they hang:
      Who pauses by the glass appears
      With a ghost's [unclear]penumbra[/unclear].
      The balconies that cage the rooms
      Lure like sea weed pulled by tides.

      Each room is like a bottle
      Where the full-legged vessels grow
      In the glass hall of a dream:
      Ships that never reach the coast
      Past the barrier of dawn.

      I have written cards to various people today, including one to M announ-
      cing that there is alternate rain & sun. Now, however, the situation has worsened.
      The French 19th July tradition of swimming in the streets may replace (unless
      the sun magically returns) [unclear]that[/unclear] of dancing in the streets.

      I love you and long to see you again outside of the charmed provinces of
      drams. I love you
      Lawrence

      P.S. Easels such as you wanted cost a minimum of 6,500 francs, I'm afraid which is more than I can afford. L.
