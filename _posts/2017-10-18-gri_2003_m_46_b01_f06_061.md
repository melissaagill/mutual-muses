      Sunday

      My dearest Sylvia,

      The problem is what to write about.  When you are on this island there is a lot to clutter about.  When you arien Siena I fear to be banal and yet what can I do but tell you what I've been doing.  It's better to do that than say in as many ways as I can that I hope youare having a splendid time in Siena.  Of course you are and I hope it is cooler than Florence.   Or perhaps it wasn[t too hot? Or perhaps it was?  The rest you must tell me.  Before going any further I must tell you how much I love you.

      Today I have been in Hapton Court and when I came back read your essay.  Admired it again.  My parents are back from Bath.  Yesterday Paul and I saw a good and old Bette Davis film.  The day before I got wonderfully 'high'; nearly tight enough to go to Paris on Saturday.  I arrange most of it with McHale but decided against it in the morning.  It has been so long since the winde flowed freely..I saw Erin that day too looking rather like the beauty editor of Britannia and Eve if you see what I mean.  For the rest musuems and libraries.

      Tomorrow I am borrowing a ladder to have a look at a doubtful Hogarth skied in St. Martin's Vestry.  The day after Claire, a French student and typist Albert and I knew in Paris, is coming here for a week or two.  I have to meet erher at Victoria.  (I wish it were another station.)  In Septemember I shall be alright for a holiday in Bath I learned today.

      I have got a delicious little book containing 15 masques.  Minerva appears constantly; in Daniel's Vision of the 12 Goddeses played at Hampton Court in 1604 thus - 'attired in a blue mantle with a silver embroidery of all weapons and engines of war with a helmet-dressing on her hand nad presents a lance and target.  This last attribute is charming don't you agree?

      You know how I like to be up to date:  today I've read bits of Pinder's Odes about the Olympic games of his day.  Nicer than the tehnicolor cameras which are to record the events!  My lectures at the NC start the day the games finish.  The torch will pass through room v...

      I itch terribly from being a long time in the sun some days ago.  It has just come out.  Today is wonderful but I stripped and sat - in the shade.  Alan.
