      Pett
      Dearest Lawrence,
      Thank you for your letter and the telegram - it is sweet of you to send one. I feel happier to-day - I feel stronger and more confident in myself and the woods!
      I hope you have a happy week. I am sure I shall feel quite cheerful again in a day ot two. I haven't been sleeping too well and so I am a bit tired.
      One thing I have to complain about you is that so often I have a feeling of writing in a vacuum as you very oftendon't answer my letters. Which reminds me have you writen to Vincent about your Hastings lecture in November?

      Thank you for your letter and the telegram - it is sweet of you to send one. I feel happier to-day-  I feel stronger and more confident in myself and the [unclear][/unclear].
      I hope you have a happy week.  I am sure I shall feel quite cheerful again in a day or two.  I haven't been sleeping too well and so I'm a bit tired.
      One thing I have to complain about you is that so often I have a feeling of writing in a vacuum as you very often don't answer my letters.  Which reminds me have you written to Vincent about your [unclear]Wastings[/unclear] Lecture in November?
