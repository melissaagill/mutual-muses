      Just as I had written that page a discreet tap called me to the door. It was Williams from downstairs with a registered packet for me which he had signed for when I was out. I had been about to say, alas, the ring, despite the good news in your letter, had not yet come, but now, I can say that I am typing, now, with it on and it is superb. Oh, Sylvia, my darling, it is beautiful and I am so happy. How beautifully is it carved and how well have 'Gunkel and Humpedinck' made the setting. It is just the right size, comfortable, neither too tight nor too loose. Oh I am ravished by your gift which shall be our emblem, for it is your image on my hand. Thank you, my love, more than I can possibly say. Your design is so suitable, just the right blend of masculinity and grace. Lionel is eulogising on it even now and Hetty has fainted with pleasure. Yawolla is awestruck and for the moment, silent, gazing at it. You can picture, I am sure, Dandylion's pride and delight: he stops typing every few words and turns his hand into many positions, fascinated by each different view and eager, too, to recapture the angle at which he had it the second before.

      Albert seems to be very well and he has brought his mistress here, a pleasant American girl, extroverted and cheerful, who is studying music. I saw them yesterday morning before John McHale and I had to leave in order to go to the Annual General meeting of A.I.A. I had to leave before the end because of my lecture at four but John McHale was going to propose me and Gerald Marks second me for the central Committee. I imagine it went through but I shall not know for a day or so. I tried to ring Marks last night but could not get through and, today, I am not going further than the pillar-box.

      To continue with my news I had dinner with Charles (a nice one, for which he paid - at last) and we went to see l'Aigle a Deux Tetes (the film). It is pleasant but not distinguished, not as good as the play,
