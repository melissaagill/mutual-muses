      In the train 18.10.52

      Dearest Lawrence,
      Just to say how much I
      love you and how much I enjoyed
      being with you, and to take care
      of yourself as you are not quite
      strong again yet but could be very
      quickly with a little care!
      (nurse see)
      I did catch a glimpse of the
      [unclear]pasture[/unclear] painting - it is about all
      that remains of the cafe - and
      I must say I regret it. We must
      go to the Riverside cafe again,
      it is most charming.
      Thank you so much for all the
      help you have given me with my
      lecture - I feel much happier about
      it and fired with enthusiasm;
      and I shall read my book swiftly
      which I think I shall finish very
      quickly.
      Best luck to the [unclear]Miezvoy[/unclear] and [unclear]Steaz [/unclear]
      lecture - I hope you have an
      appreciative audience - I think
      it may be larger than we antic-

      Midland Hotel Birmingham Notepaper
      On The Train
      18.10.52
      Dearest Lawrence
      Just to say how much I love you and how much I enjoyed being with you, and do take care of yourself as you are not quite strong again yet but could be very quickly with a little care! (Nurse See.)
      I did catch a glimpse of the Passmore painting - it is about all that remains of the cafe - and I must say I regret it. We must go to the Riverside Cafe again, it is most charming.
      Thank you so much for all the help you have gven me with my lecture - I feel much happier about it and filled with enthusiasm; and I shall read my book shortly which I think I shall finish very quickly.
      Best luck with the McEvoy and [unclear]Steal[/unclear] lecture - I hope you have an appreciative audience - I think it may be larger than we antic-
