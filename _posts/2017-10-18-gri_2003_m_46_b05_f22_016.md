      reputation and popularity, Stear
      and McEvoy both have their
      following. The more I think of
      it the more pleased I am with
      our Stear discoveries - for it
      does bring some sense and reason
      to his seemingly chaotic oeuvre.
      Sunday I slept very badly last
      night and missed you very
      much. I hope that you slept well.
      and had a pleasant evening with
      your parents. How was your lecture?
      I enclose the Observer cutting
      you asked for and some film
      criticisms - I shall also send
      a long article about Chaplin when
      Tiny has finished with it. I say
      don't forget the Hazitt [unclear]Poswate[/unclear]
      view with sherry, and to ask
      Gainsborough if you can review it.
      George wrote a letter which I
      just received suggesting I might
      like to come to see [unclear]her[/unclear] play - the
      Nov. 24th is the day of the adjudicat
      -tion so I think I shall go.
