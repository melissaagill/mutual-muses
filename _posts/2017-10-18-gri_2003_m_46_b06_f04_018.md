      The Atonement of Gosta Berling opens with slow shots, panning and fixed, of natural landscape - panoramic and with a sense of scale and light.

      The Atonement of Gosta Berling opens with slow shots, pan-
      ing and fixed, of natural landscape--panoramic and with a
      sense of scale and light.  Such slow treatment, with sluggish
      fades, suggests reverence, perhaps for God-in-Nature.  The 1st
      subtitle, when it finally comes is absurd--'in the heart of
      the country':  surprise!  The subtitles, though the obscure
      plot needs them, continually jar:  'Why, Countess, what are you
      doing alone on the ice at night?' and so on.  The reader of

      compositional sense of Maurice Stiller have grandeur but the
      nobility lurches continually into bathos.  Too may arms are
      raised to point at too many doors.
      The opening suggests the rightness of nature.  The rhetoric
      of the human beings who soon appear is not devoid of insight--
      for example the Countess' monologue to Gosta is eloquent in every

      is everybody's lot sooner or later.  Large eyes look so often
      at the wreck of their life or hopes or on the past that psycho-
      logical malaise shadows the pantheistic landscape sense.
      Permananetly and expressingly the ham acting dissolves the present (the real

      The Atonement of Gosta Berling opens with slow shots, pan-ning and fixed, of natural landscape - panoramic and with a sense of scale and light. Such slow treatment, with sluggish fades, suggests reverence, perhaps for God-in-Nature. The 1st subtitle, when it finally comes is absurd - 'in the heart of the country': surprise! The subtitles, though the obscure plot needs them, continually jar: 'Why, countess, what are you doing alone on the ice at night?' and so on. The reader of Conrad and the reader of the New Yorker must join in finding these sub-titles grotesque and provincial. The images and the compositional sense of Maurice Stiller have grandeur but the nobility lurches continually into bathos. Too many arms are raised to point at too many doors.
      The opening suggests the rightness of nature. The rhetoric of the human beings who soon appear is not devoid of insight - for example the Countess' monologue to Gosta is eloquent in every gesture, and Greta Garbo's sensual face really makes something of the symbolic flight across the lake. However, the drag-ging of the plot, its perpetual detours and repetitions, does express a state of mind which soaks the film's texture. Grand-eur becomes perversity in the lingering carressing anguish which is everybody's lot sooner or later. Large eyes look so often at the wreck of their life of hopes or on the past that a psycho-logical malaise shadows the pantheisitic landscape sense.
      Perversely & expressively the ham-acting dissolves the present (the real images on the screen, that is) & sucks our attention back to remote causal guilt. Exasperation and administration are thus mingled in one's reaction to this film, 30 years after it was made.
