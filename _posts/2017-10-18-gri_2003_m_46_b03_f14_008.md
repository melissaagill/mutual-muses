      4.7.50
      Dearest Lawrence
      I am so glad that you are pleased with my sketches. I managed to work again on my garden picture which I hope to finish this afternoon. The weather has not been fine enough for me to do any more to your view - but I hold myself [unclear]in heading[/unclear] for the first fine morning. I have no yet managed to do any more of the "flight" but hope to this evening - I am not painting the canvas - only [unclear]sizing[/unclear] it. I thought it would be interesting to try something on the rather nice silvery beige of the canvas, which would be easier [unclear]in[/unclear] so large a picture, also as I have it on a stretcher of less than the full size I thought it might not be a good thing to prime it in sections.
