       I hope you are less keyed up
      now, my poor Lion  I do hope that
      you have comfortable journeys and
      can sleep perhaps - anyway I
      hope there was a good film to
      see.
      I enclose a rather cut cutting of "Times"
      film criticism - and the J. Verne that
      I forgot last time.
      I must go and get on with
      my work -
      Be of good cheer my Lio  - it
      will be lovelg to have you here
      again.
      I love you
      Sylvia

      5 I hope you are less keyed up
      now, my poor Lion I do hope that
      you have comfortable journeys and
      can sleep perhaps - any way I
      hope there was a good film to
      see.
      I enclose a rather [unclear]cut[/unclear] cutting of "Times"
      film criticism - and the J. Verne that
      I forgot last time.
      I must go and get on with
      my work.
      Be of good cheer my Lion - it
      will be lovely to have you here
      again. I adore you
      Sylvia.
