      Dearest Lawrence,
      How I love you and how
      I miss you and I'm so sorry
      that you had to go so soon.
      I do hope that you will not get
      over-tired again with all your
      travelling and lectures.  It is quarter
      to 3 now so I suppose that you
      are nearly there.  I do hope that
      you had a comfortable journey
      and will not have a rush.  I
      hope also that you managed to get
      an adequate lunch.  I did so
      wish I had been with you.
      I'm afraid I haven't been very bright
      or good company this weekend.
      I'm so sorry; and thank you so
      much for the very kind and tactful
      part that you played.  I really must
      not get so tired again it is pain-
      ful!  I am silly on the sofa
      in the studio with two
      cushions writing this it is snug
      up here ant I shall try to work

      1-10-52 Pett Dearest Lawrence,
      How I love you and how
      I miss you and I'm so sorry
      that you had to go to soon -
      I do hope that you will not get
      over - tired again with all your
      travelling and lectures. It is quarter
      to 3 now, so I suppose that you
      are nearly there - I do hope that
      you had a comfortable journy
      and will not have a rush - I
      hope also that you managed to get
      an adequate lunch - I did so
      wish I had been with you.
      I'm afraid I haven't been very bright
      on good company this week-end -
      I'm so sorry; and thank you so
      much for the very kind and tactful
      part that you played. I really wish -
      not get so tired again it is pain-
      ful! I am sitting on the sopha
      in the studio with two
      cushions writing this, it is snug
      up here and I should try to work
