      THE DEREALISED ISLAND iii

      That rest upon the stone: sublunar me
      Beneath the bridge remote in mist,
      Where the sun floats in a temperate shower
      That stops the heat from parching beauty's faces.
      Permanent stalactites pallidly descend!

      The sun is an orange in the nature morte,
      The only import on the ruinous table,
      With broken glass and cinder-leaves,
      Empty kicked-in biscuit tins
      Rising in corroded pyramids,
      Where pylons, girders, funnels, bar the sky
      With mechanical trapezees
      Like singeries for legions of ape.

      Music defines the cafe with its sighs
      And aural equivalents for warmth:
      Outside the rain falls like baroque curtains
      From the family portraits of the sky;
      Sand is blown across the promenade
      As across a treaty signed by Winter
      And along the coast in mounting waves
      Disintegrating suits of armour roll.

      THE DEREALISED ISLAND   iii

      Neptune and two fish-wives crown a ware-house,
      Baskets replacing urns for industry.
      I pace the quay among the huge ear-rings
      That rest upon the stone: sublunar me
      Beneath the bridge remote in mist,
      Where the sun floats in a temperate shower
      That stops the heat from parching beauty's faces.
      Permanent stalactites pallidly descend!

      The sun is an orange in the nature morte,
      The only import on the ruinous table,
      With broken glass and cinder-loaves,
      Empty kicked-in biscuit tins
      Rising in corroded pyramids,
      Where pylons, girders, funnels, bar the sky
      With mechanical trapezes
      Like singeries for legions of ape.

      Music defines the cafe with its sighs
      And aural equivalents for warmth:
      Outside the rain falls like baroque curtains
      From the family portraits of the sky:
      Sand is blown across the promenade
      As across a treaty signed by Winter
      And along the coast in mounting waves
      Disintegrating suits of armor roll.

      The pier projects beyond the slimed boulders
      Under which the giants still move like tides
      And butt the girders with half-buried heads:
      Planning a poem long enough for giants
      Of past revolt to read should they escape
      I file the bars of mild topography,
      Open and close my eyes along the route,
      And catch the falling leaves in Constable's country.
