                       II
      Insaw She Stoops To Conquer at the New Theatre:
      Redgrave is familiar but charming but the rest of
      the cast and the production is extremely dull.
      I gather Tiny is away so perhaps she did not read
      my letter containing a slip of material I bought
      for her. I forgot to tell her the price: it is
      4s. 6d. a yard, there is nothing cheaper: they say
      Tiny must have invented anything cheaper.
      I assure you if I don't see you soon I shall sweep
      you off as Hades did Persephone. I adore you and
       am longing to see you. I hope I shall find you
      less distributing than last time: I am thinking very
      seriously about what to wear.
      [image of drawing]
      I love you so much. You must not put off your day of
      arrival, no matter how reasonable the objections are that
      M. raise. Hurry, I adore you, I love you
           Oh my darling, my beauty, do you look forward to seeing
      me again? do you? I love you

      I saw She Stoops To Conquor at the New a Theatre: Redgrave is familiar but charming but the rest of the cast and the production is extremely dull.

      I gather Tiny is away so perhaps she did not read my letter containing a slip of the material I bought for her. I firgot to tell her the price: it is 4s. 6d. a yard, there is nothing cheaper: they say Tiny must have invented anything cheaper.

      I assure you if I don 'the see you soon I shall sweep you off as Hades did Persephone. I adore you and am longing to see you. I hope I shall find you less disturbing than last time: I am thinking very seriously about what to wear.

      I love you so much. You must not put off your day of arrival, no matter how reasonable the objections are that M. raise. Hurry. I adore you. I love you

      Oh my darling, my beauty, do you look forward to seeing me again? Do you? I love you
