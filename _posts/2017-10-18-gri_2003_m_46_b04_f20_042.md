      3  blood transfusion.  She is still in
      hospital at present.
      I have noo other news - except
      that I hope "to rope in" Carol and
      Desiree to pose for my picture
      I shall make Desiree Prosephine
      if possible.
      How is Paul getting on - has he
      starting the project for a set of
      pictures that he had in mind?
      I shall go to the post now.
      Via the Oak as I owe it money!
      I hope I may do a little more painting this afternoon.
      I love you, dearest Lion, tell
      me your news - I love you
