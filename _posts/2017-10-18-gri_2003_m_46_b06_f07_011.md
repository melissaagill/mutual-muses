      mean not too much extra work for
      you. I am glad you and he can go
      to Rye together and I look forward
      to seeing your sketch. Yes, do
      try and get me to Pett for August [unclear][/unclear]
      holiday. There is nothing I would like
      better. Should I write anything to
      either Wood?

      I am waiting impatiently to hear how
      your resurrection goes.

      I wll send you more of The White Rabbit
      when it is done. This morning I have
      written of Mouli Rouge instead of
      getting on with more pressing business
      I'm afraid. But I had an idea,
      Real work after lunch.

      I couldn't see my parents yesterday,
      so I am going there on Saturday.

      I love love love you
      I adore you
      Lawrence

      am waiting impatiently to hear how<br/>your resurrection goes.<br/>I will send
      you more of The White Rabbit<br/>when it is done.  This morning I have<br/>written
      of Moulin Rouge instead of getting on with more pressing business<br/>I'm afraid.  But
      I had an idea.<br/>Real work after lunch.<br/>I couldn't see my parents yesterday<br/>so
