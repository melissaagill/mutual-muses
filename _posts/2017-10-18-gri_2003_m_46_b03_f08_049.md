      Blackheath
      24 ix 1950

      Dearest Sylvia,

      I enclose a carbon copy of your article.  As I typed it
      I made one or two small adjustments :  I felt I could do this
      for as one types and the article looks more as it does when
      in print little things occur to me.  I hope you agree.  As
      i typed my admiration for its structure and your individual
      phrases, with something of Osbert's richness and irony, grew.
      I do think it a very good article indeed.

      You know the letter you send me for Gainsborough is unsigned.
      So what I think I shall do is send the article with a photo-
      graph of Bronzino's Allegory, recommending your article to
      G's attention at the same time, and quoting your suggested
      illustration.  He is expecting the photograph and I can in-
      clude on Painting Out of Doors with it.  Let me know first
      post on Monday if this is acceptable :  I will wait until then
      before dispatching it (the week end intervenes anyhow so we
      shall not be wasting time).  And, again, congratulations on
      your article - I did enjoy it.

      I enclose, at last, the lyrics for you, my darling.  At
      last, you can say now, some love poems from my lion at last,
      directly to me.  I have written them carefully, investing
      much love in them :  hence the long time in sending them.  I
      hope they are worth it.  Oh dearest Sylvia, I love you so
      much and miss you with fearful intensity.  We must meet soon.
      Hetty, Yawolla, Dandy, miss you so much and Lionel, though he
      has said nothing directly, is very pale and quiet.  Oh I
      love you, my beauty, love you, love you.  Yawolla is cheered up, however, by his new playmate :  I had great difficulty in
      keeping Y off the mobile though, of course, she is light enough
      and agile enough not to harm it.

      The only pictures I can think of with artists at work are
      impressionist garden pieces which would reproduce badly.  I
      think the Cezanne pictures you mentioned would do very well.

      At last, today, I am going to go to the Kensington Gallery.
      I shall go to the V and A, make out some lantern slide lists,
      and then go to the Salon.  I need not tell you, darling, how
      much I am looking forward to seeing your pictures there.  I
      feel very bad at not having been able to get there before.  The
      Smiths hope to go, next Tuesday, as he has a half-day off for
      Christmas shopping.

      The A.I.A. 'emergency' was simply because it was the last
      meeting of the present committee.  2 hours long :  very bor-
      ing.  I have said I may stand again for next year but I am
      doubtful and unsure.  Shall I?  There does not seem much
      point.
