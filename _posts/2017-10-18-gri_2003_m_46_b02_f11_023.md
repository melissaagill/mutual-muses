      44 Queen Street Redcar Yorkshire  12 xii 1949
      Dearest Sylvia,
      Monday morning has brought no news, as yet, of the exhibition but it has bought what I so much more desired, a letter from you.
      I am glad your lecture was better attended, a marked rise in numbers. Probably had it gone on a bit numbers would have justly increased. The fact attendance recovered seems to give the lie to the canon blaming you for the attendance. He sounds a nice creature-nice. When I reached the point in your letter when the epidiascope burst into flames I laughed and laughed-it had the cumualtive comic effect of one of Sir Oswald's stories about the cavalry (I have almost finished great training) When Mrs Moorhouse brought in my eggs and bacon I was chuckling away, madly, to myself

      44 Queen Street    [unclear]Redcar[/unclear]  Yorkshire    12 x11 1949

      Dearest Sylvia,

      Monday morning has brought no news, as yet, of the exhibition, but it has brought what I so much more desired, a letter from you.

      I am glad your lecture was better attended, a marked rise in numbers.  Probably had it gone on a bit numbers would have durther increased.  The fact attendance recovered seems to give the lie to the canon blaming you for the attendance.  He sounds a vile creature - vile.  When I reached the point in your letter when the [unclear]epidiascope[/unclear] burst into flames I laughed and laughes - it had the cumulative comic effect of one of Sir Osbert's stories about the cavalry.  (I have almost finished Great Morning.)  When Mrs [unclear]Woorbouse[/unclear] brought in my eggs and bacon I was still chuckling away, madly, to myself.

      Yes, I think Yorkshire good-will is a well-founded myth (though, of course, library staff must be excluded from any generalisations - leaving as they do in an introverted philistine world of their own).  I meant to remark in earlier letters but seem always to have suppressed it that the people, apart from my hosts who are exemplary, all seem amiable, not afraid of smiling - as great a contrast as I could wish to the people in the midlands.

      [unclear]Melty[/unclear] has showered questions on me about the exact appearance of your new coat but I tell her she must wait and see.

      from my hosts who are exemplary, all seem amiable, not afraid of smiling - as
      a great contrast as I could wish to the people in the midlands.  Pretty has

      her she must wait and see. '

      44 Queen Streent Redear Yorkshire
      12 XII 1949
      Dearest Sylvia,
      Monday morning has brought no news, as yet, of the exhibition but it has brought what I so much more desired, a letter from you.
      I am glad your lecture was [unclear]better[/unclear] attended, a marked rise in numbers. Probably had it gone on a bit numbers would have further increased. The [unclear]foel[/unclear] attendance reconered seems to give the [unclear]lie[/unclear] to the canon claming you for the attendance. He sounsa a vile creature - vile. When I reached the point in your letter when the [unclear]epidioscope[/unclear] burst into flames I laughed and laughed - it has the comulative comic effect of one of Sir [unclear]Orlando stones[/unclear] about the cavalry. (I have almost finished Great Morning) When [unclear]Inns moorloure[/unclear] brought in my eggs and bacon I was still chuckling away, [unclear]modly[/unclear], to myself.
      Yes, I think Yorkshire good-will is a well-founded myth (though, of course, library staff must be excluded from any generalization - leaving as they do in a [unclear]introverted philistine[/unclear] world of their own). I meant to remark in earlier letters [unclear][/unclear] seem always to have a suppressed it that the people, apart from [unclear]tests[/unclear] who are exemplary, all seem amiable, not afraid of smiling - as great a contrast as I could wish to the people in the midlands.
      [unclear]Poetry[/unclear] has slowed[unclear]questioning[/unclear] on me about the exact appearance of your new coat [unclear]and I tell her[/unclear] she must wait and see.

      your lecture was better attended, a marked rise in numbers. Probably had it
      gone on a bit numbers would have further increased. The foel attendance reconered
      seems to give the lie to the canon claming you for the attendance. He sounsa
      a vile creature - vile. When I reached the point in your letter when the epidioscope
      burst into flames I laughed and laughed - it has the comulative comic effect
      of one of Sir Orlando stones about the cavalry. (I have almost finished Great
      Morning) When Inns moorloure brought in my eggs and bacon I was still chuckling
      away, modly, to myself.<br/>Yes, I think Yorkshire good-will is a well-founded
      myth (though, of course, library staff must be excluded from any generalization

      I tell her she must wait and see.
