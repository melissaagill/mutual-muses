      28 October 1951
      Dearest Sylvia
      If you are in town next Wednesday I do hope we can meet. I am free until
      the evening when I must go to Banstead. How lovely if we can meet. If you do
      not come I see that M is coming anyway. Do you mean he will come to Black-
      heath? You must let me know when: then I shall be in. Why is he going to
      look for a room when he has a job at Cambridge...?
      I wonder how you enjoy lecturing again.  I am sure that you will like it.
      Hetty wonders if she can book the same lecture from you for the L.I. (Lion's
      Institute) at an early date. Tell me if you accept (one kiss for 'no', two for 'yes').
      Last night I saw Parsons again. Magda & John entertained him as a possible
      buyer but I think that he will be no more [unclear]are[/unclear] to John than to me. He has removed
      a good deal of his moustache but he is quite the same as ever I'm afraid. But
      Magda took John & I to a very nice dinner first and we had lots of excellent
      wine and that made up for the later part of the evening.
      Your new picture sounds charming in colour and your sketch is full of sweep-
      ing flowing rhythms - as in your picture of Tiny In The Rose Garden though this
      new one will, I think, be more successful. some dabbling of the paint after it is
      laid in the sley is a  delicate piece of technique I hope to see shortly. (My
      Hastings lecture is probably 6th December, by the way).
      Here is a new poem called AFTER ANCESTORS WHAT
      When marble trees, column
      On the evening terrace,
      Smooth dogs or hunting ones,
      Skies made of drapery,
      Are carted off by time,
      Made chaos of by wind,
      What is left except what's gripped by hand?

      The skull is left, the scroll
      unfurling to the night,
      The sword-guard twining like
      Female genitals around the waist.

      When storms are energy
      Not gestures of a block
      No attribute is certain
      Of identity and only
      The convex of a mask
      Faces the concave head.

      And I am working on a on a poem comparing autumn to a Wunder Kammer and another
      one called NOCTURNE AFTER NINE as well as attempting to finish a few poems
      on scattered subjects. In short I am writing verse again.
      Lewisham station is being painted and really  it begins to look quite pretty.
      Perhaps it will  be the turn of Blackheath next - it needs it.
      Magda and John are both looking forward to seeing you again and so
      are Madeleine and Paul. But even more passionately waiting to see you are
      Dandy, Hetty, Lionel, & YAWOLLA. Oh  I love you so much. I
      hope I see you on Wednesday. I adore you
      Lawrence
