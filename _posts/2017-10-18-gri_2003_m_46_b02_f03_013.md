      I adore you, beautiful cat, Minerva, and memories
      of you fill me with delight. You enchant me from
      afar as consumately as when we are together - rav-
      ishing villian that you are. I love you, love you.

      It was lucky that it was rainy the day you did
      your watercolour, for when the sun is out the view
      is virtually invisible all the afternoon, with the
      glare and the dirty windows.

      In the soft gulf of twilight
      Out-post of the reasonable day,
      Summer, dreams, and comets wait
      To populate the lawn of sleep.

      Games of sleep make roses on
      The negro ceiling of my room:
      A crimson arch that bridges
      All fears of solitude.

      The Vice-Chairman of one of the committees has
      been in since I started this letter (the one who
      takes photographs artistically). I complained of
      the caption to the picture and he is going to see
      the Editor of the paper in official capacity him-
      self.

      It is a splendid day. I am writing at the table
      you sat on and frankly most improper thoughts
      are sponsored by this memory. The sun is warm
      on my back and lions - like cats - like this. I
      wish you were here.

      I love you, my beautiful Sylvia, I love you.

      The vice-chairman of one of the committees has been in since I started this letter (the one who takes photographs artistically): I complained of the caption to the picture and he is going to see the Editor of the paper in official capacity himself.

      It is a splendid day. I am writing at the table you sat on and frankly most improper thought are sponsored by this memory. The sun is warm on my back and lions - like cats - like this. I wish you were here.

      I love you, my beautiful Sylvia, I love you,
      Lawrence
