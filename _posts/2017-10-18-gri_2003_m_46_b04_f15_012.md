      I rang up the 'Bus Office this
      morning, they will not take un-
      accompanied parcels, so the
      best thing to do I think is
      to send it by passenger tram
      to Charing Cross to arrive on
      Tuesday at mid-day. Then
      you can fetch it without much
      inconvenience, I hope. (If possible
      please preserve the packing as I
      shall have to use picture backing
      and corrigated card board -
      no so easy to come by!)
      I am most disappointed about
      the FIlm column - only hope
      Gainsborough may change his mind.
      I say, have you thought of sending
      anything to Jolas? I think
      you will have to finish your
      two books quick - you might
      make the necessary "dibs" with
