      In the V & A
      13 October (Friday)
      Dearest Sylvia
      I have been in the slide department since 10.15 (it is now
      1.15) collecting slides. I wonder how you have spent the
      morning: with luck you will have painted some of your
      Flight. I do hope that you have found a suitable frame
      and stretcher in Hastings. Think you how much you could
      paint in the 3 stuffy hours I have been in the V & A!

      Your letter delighted me this morning - containing no
      less than 2 drawings! I was enchanted with the first &
      you can imagine my rapture at discovering a second
      sketch on the second page. Dearest, I adore you - how
      felicitous these decorations are. I can imagine
      you very well firmly opening all the windows on the 'bus
      wide.

      Well, I'm delighted to hear Tiny and my arrangement about
       the American comics. Let us by all means work it in
      that manner. I am sorry to hear that it was hard
      for her to pay. That's something Dandy understands only
      too well!

      Miss Chick wants me to think about a Hogarth exhibit-
      ion (charts and photographs) to coincide with next year's
      big Hogarth exhibition. It is her own idea and she has
