      age and the implied coherence of each group of stories which will
      occupy us here.
      Another distinct between the portmanteau film and the book of
      short stories is that the arrangement of the stories in a film is
      calculated in a way different from the arrangement of a published
      collection. The episodes in Full House, for example, are (i)
      amusing and witty, (ii) manly and harsh, (iii) poignant with up-
      lift, (iv) comedy, (v) sentimental. Take Souvenirs Perdus: the
      moods are bitter-sweet, humorous, melodramatic, and farcical, in
      that order. Quartet offers irony, failure, eccentricity, sop-
      histicated comedy. Though the word quartet should not mislead
      us into looking for musical analogies there is no doubt that the
      episodes are arranged more carefully than, say, the acts in a music
      hall. The complimentary character of the parts persuades the
      audience to consider the whole as unified and not as four or five
      arbitrary pieces.
      The short story is a popular form in the 20c. and there are
      generally thought to be two poles between which the form extends.
      There is the tight, neat story which concludes pungently and iron-
      ically and there is the story of atmosphere in which a situation
      is presented without conventional preparation and closes without
      an epigram. The pure example of the first type is mechanistic,
      rational, and worldly; the pure example of the second type is in-
      tuitive, sensuous, and Bergsonian. The respective dangers of the
      two manners are (i) a false automatic conclusiveness and (ii) form-
      lessness. The stories adapted by film makers do not belong to the
      latter group and their vices are not formlessness. In England
