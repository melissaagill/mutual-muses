      4 as I ought to see Georgie on
      the 24th and it will be a nice
      excuse to be with you!
      I wonder if there is any news
      from Gainsborough - at worst I hope
      he will let you review the show.
      If you think of any further names
      for cards do jot them down I think
      this is vitally important. I have
      addressed a further 50 envelopes,
      including one to each of the galleries.
      Do tell me all your news and
      how your lectures went and the discuss-
      ion was like. We have your chair
      in the studio we all declare it to
      be both elegant and comfortable!
      Directly I have get my pictures done
      I will get to work on it!
      Tiny and I hope to go to "Intimate
      Relations" on Wednesday matinee. The
      snaps are ready tomorrow. The winding has
      blown part of the wall down at the corner
      of Panel Lane - We are very sad about it.

      I love you
      Sylvia

      4 as I ought to see Georgie on
      the 24th and it will be a nice
      excuse to be with you!
      I wonder if there is any news
      from Gainsborough - [unclear][/unclear] I hope
      he will let you review the show.
      If you think of any further names
      for cards do jot them down, I think
      this is vitally important. I have
      addressed a further 50 envelopes,
      including one to each of the galleries.
      Do tell me all your news and
      how your lectures went and the discuss-
      ion was like. We have your chair -
      in the studio, we all declare it to
      be both elegant and comfortable!
      directly I have got my pictures done
      I will get to work on it!
      Tiny and I hope to go to "Intamate
      Relation's" on Wednesday Matinee. The
      snaps are ready tomorrow. The windy has
      blown part of the wall down at the corner
      of Panel Lane - we are very sad about it.

      I Love You
      Sylvia
