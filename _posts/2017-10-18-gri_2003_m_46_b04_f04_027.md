      Pett  17/IV/51

      My darling,
      I am enclosing a letter from Match and
      Co which arrived this morning.  In the
      circumstances I think a verbal explanation
      of the situation vis-a-vis the Maxwell's would
      probably be the best course--if you can spare
      the time for a journey to Swiss Cottage.  If you
      prefer to write it well involved delay owing
      to letters having to be forwarded from this address.
      We have promptly acknowledged
      receipt of Maxwell's two changes, so have never
      before been required to furnish any other
      form of receipt.  I do not understand his
      insistence on this point, unless it be in lieu
      of a reference.  Also, we must obtain access
      to the flat for the purpose of checking the
      inventories and so on.
      Incidetally, the first sum of 25.10.0 must
      have been receipted by Merm Match, themselves.

      Match & Co which arrived this morning. In the circumstances I think a verbal
      explanation of the situation vis-a-vis the Maxwell's would probably be the best
      course - if you can spare the time for a journey to Swiss Cottage. If you prefer
      to write it will involve delay owing to letters having to be forwarded from
      this address. \nWe have proptly acknowledged receipt of Maxwell's two cheques,
      & have never before been required to furnish any other form of receipt. I do
      not understand his insistence on this point, unless it be in line of a reference.
      Also, we must obtain access to the flat for the purpose of checking the inventories
      & so on. \nI incidentally, the first sum of [unclear]L[/unclear] 25.10.0 must
