    clean_transcription: London 23 June<br/>Dearest Sylvia<br/><br/>I am sorry to
      appear so exasperating. If<br/>you can afford it (and if you don't mind<br/>me
      coming later on the 6th than you), there<br/>is nothing in the world I should
      like bet-<br/>ter than to be with you at Wales. What<br/>you interpreted as
      lack of keenness if<br/>nothing but a reluctance to involve<br/>you in more
      expenses, but as you say<br/>say it is alright, this caution of mine<br/>is
      nowhere. It would be lovely, abso-<br/>lutely divine to be with you then. In<br/>any
      case, whatever happens, I expect<br/>you on 15th - 23rd at Blackheath.<br/><br/>How
      charming of George and Beryl to<br/>say they would be glad to put me up.<br/>Why
      do you say that you think it would<br/>not be approved of, though? Surely
