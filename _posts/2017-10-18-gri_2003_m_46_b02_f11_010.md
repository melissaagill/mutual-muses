      The exhibition, which is advertised as opening today,
      will have to be hung - when it arrives - in the reading room,
      among the old men reading the Illustrated London News and
      the Tatler, who will remain there all the time. I was rath-
      er un-nerved by this but I suppose it does not really
      matter provided that they do not hawk continually.
      I have found in the library a fascinating book of
      essays about poetry by John Clare Ransom which I hope
      to read while I'm here. Last night I started a new
      poem, quite a long one. I have written already 90
      lines and, when it has been polished, I will send this
      section to you. I have combined various aspects of
      C16th iconology [Bemlo's 3 stages of love, &c.] with the poet's
      vision of a Triumph. I hope you will like it.
      Last night I managed to post a letter at Dar-
      lington where I had to change trains: I sent it to the flat - I hope it reached you there in time.
      This letter is rather a recital of facts but I like
      telling you what happens to your lion when we are a-
      part for it seems to lessen the miles between us - I hope
      for you as for me.
      I love you dearly and think of you all the time,
      with especial feeling when I look at my ring, as the
      sun flashes through the window, and the reality of our
