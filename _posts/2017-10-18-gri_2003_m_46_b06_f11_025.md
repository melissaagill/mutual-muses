      preliminary period. The year after Klee's book appeared Kan-
      dinski published Point and Line to Plane based on his own course,
      and covering some of the same ground as the Sketchbook. Kan-
      dinski's book (as you might expect) is much longer than Klee's
      and has a rigidity and comprehensiveness in its examination of
      formal elements which is academic compared to Klee. Though
      Klee looked for and found 'a formula covering all circulating
      forces at once' (5) his handling of it is highly flexible.
      Kandinski tries to give sensory expression to universals, like
      A CINQUECENTO mannerist reasoning to explain invisible beauty,
      whereas Klee's art is rooted in specific events and feelings.
      Keel used to draw for his classes with both hands at once:
      Kandinski could almost say of his Circles period (1925-7) -
      'look, no hands'. As Leo Stein wrote: 'in every sketch of
      Klee's the symbol is fashioned anew. If this is mysticism it
      is certainly not of the medieval contemplative kind. It is a
      restless existential mysticism' (6).
      The preliminary course was divided into 3 categories: obser-
      vation, representation, and design. Observation meant study
      of nature and the study of materials, and
      here Klee was qualified indeed, as Stein shows. Representation
      was the study of geometry and draughtsmanship, along with
      model-making and construction. Design was the study of volume,
      color, and composition. As we shall see, Klee failed to deal with the category of design in a satisfactory way.
