      Saturday
      11 Mansel Road

      Dearest Sylvia:

      I must start this with some dates.  My parents leave on the 16th August, a Monday, and come back twelve days later,  on Saturday the 28th.  I think even with your extension in Italy this will enable you to visit here - will it not?  I need not tell you how warmly I hope so.  If not I shall get a hotel room in September, though this is not nearly so pleasant a prospect, though, as you well know.  I should be delighted if I met you in a hovel.  How near your departure date is:  I only really grasped how close today when I was thinking about you and Paris.

      (You may be interested to hear that the 27th July, Paul is to be tested for entrance to [unclear]Dramatic[/unclear] School - at [unclear]Sehert[/unclear] Hall.  A Shakespeare speech, a mime, and so on.)

      Even, [unclear]reverting[/unclear] to the above paragraph, if my loan does work it will not be in time to see you in Paris.
