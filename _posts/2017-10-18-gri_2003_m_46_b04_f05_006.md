      Bath 13 V 1951
      Dearest Sylvia,
      The weather yesterday was splendid - I hope for you, too.
      I spent the day (nearly 6 hours of it, at least) in the open & am
      slightly pinker in consequence. I forgot to pack my [unclear]nerls[/unclear].
      The occasion was something called a [unclear]gymklarva[/unclear] (JIM KARNER?)
      and it was mostly horses: hence [unclear]Dieadre[/unclear]'s interest.
      The castle above [unclear]Darch[/unclear]
      is Sham Castle - that
      essential accent on
      the hills.
      There was also a
      pet show: you can
      imagine my pleasure
      at the apparently
      interminable events.
      I had hoped to go to [unclear]Kiglevt[/unclear] but it is rather expensive. I am
      not sure about [unclear]Bristol[/unclear] but I may be able to get there: I hope so.
      Although I bought the [unclear]Arthuria[/unclear] book to read down here I find
      that my hosts have a copy of W. S. Gilbert's Savoy Operas which are
      very amazing indeed. Ruddigore & The Mikado I have read al-
      ready.
      Revisitations of the city,
      Half-echoeing the memory,
      Half-connecting later follies:
      I did not remember the hills
      came so close to the city plan.

      Bath 13 v 1951

      Dearest Sylvia,

      The weather yesterday was splendid - I hope for you, too. I spent the day (nearly 6 hours of it, at least) in the open and am slightly pinked in consequence. I forgot to pack my veils. The occasion ws something called a gymkharna (JIM KARNER?) and it was mostly horses: hence [unclear]Dieardre's[/unclear] interest.

      The castle above Dandy is sham castle - that essential accent on the hills.

      There was also a pet show: you can imaging my pleasure at the apparently interminable events.

      I had hoped to go to Longleat but it is rather expensive. I am not sure about Bristol but I may be able to get there - I hope so.

      Althoug I brought the Arthurian book to read down here I find that my hosts have a copy of W. S. Gilbert's Savoy Operas which are very amusing indeed. [unclear]Ruddigore[/unclear] and The Mikado I have read already.

      Revisitations of the city,
      Half-echoing the memory,
      Half-connecting later follies:
      I did not remember the hills
      Came so close to the city plan.
