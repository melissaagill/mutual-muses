      your lecturing as all these possibilities may fall through - but you will be without again in the Summer.  I think you must be realistic.  I have been hoping that something would turn up for you, but I think it probably has, and you must take time by the forelock.  In the mean time look for [unclear]advertisments[/unclear]
         I love you so much.  I wish to be with you - but I think it is necessary to live in a dignified way - not dependent on your parents and afraid to answer the door to the milkman.
         I love you
