      your new article and long to read it - how exciting!
      I showed [unclear]Dandy's[/unclear] picture to Marjorie who thoroughly enjoyed it - I had already described it to her - and the drawing is not quite correct - historically!
      I don't think I shall need my box and easel - I shouldn't bother to bring it - as you say there are the large watercolours.
      Thank you for the delightful poems - how delicious!
      Clifford is coming to town with Michael tomorrow - to see [unclear]Hake[/unclear] and the Toulouse-Lautrec's. He would like to have met you but didn't know when he would see [unclear]Haire[/unclear].
      I have quite a lot of pictures in - and a lot of work to do, I think - I was rushing about all yesterday! Have you my ring? I love you, I adore you, Sylvia

         I don't think I shall need my box and easel.  I shouldn't bother to bring it - as you say there are the large watercolours.
         Thank you for the delightful poems - how delicious!
         Clifford is coming to town with Michael tomorrow - to see Haire and the Toulouse-Lautrec's.  He would like to have met you but didn't know when he would see Haire.
         I have quite a lot of pictures in - and a lot of work to do I think.  I was rushing about all yesterday!  Have you my ring?
         I love you, I adore you
                 Sylvia

    clean_transcription: your new article and long to read it - how exciting!<br/>   I
      showed Dandy's picture to Marjorie who thoroughly enjoyed it.  I had already
      described it to her - and the drawing is not quite correct - historically!<br/>   I
