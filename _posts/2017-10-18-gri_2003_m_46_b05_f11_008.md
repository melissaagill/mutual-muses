      thusiastic introduction to the subject.
      Mr. John C. Tarr's Good Handwriting and How to Acquire It
      is, alone of the books reviewed here, practical.  He offers
      instruction in the acquisition of the chancery script and
      discusses bad hands of various kinds--a chapter which prompted
      personal disquiet in one reader, at least.  Chancery is recommended
      for Clarity, Speed, Beauty, and Pleasantness.  There is useful
      advice on pen-nibs, models to be imitated, margins, paper, and
      rational flourishes.
      'Who will deny', Mr. West demands, 'that a letter written by
      hand will impart something that is direct between friends, and
      that it is a gesture no machine can make?'  I will.  To assert
      tis is to be guilty of a sentimental, anti-mechanistic bias with
      which handwriting--if it is to prosper in a machine age--should
      not be associated.  William Morris (with whom modern handwriting
      has a direct link via Edward Johnston and Sir Sidney Cockerell-
      Morris' secretary) made the mistake of resisting the machine emotionally
      instead of attempting to humanize and improve its products.  The
      machine need not be 'inhuman':  after all, the first italic type
      of Aldus Manutius, which has influenced even typwriter letters,
      was based on hand-written italic.

      TRAJAN'S COLUMN THREE
      antiqua or lettera anticha formata and Lettera anticha
      corsiva. Nevertheless Mr West's book is an informative and en-
      thusiastic introduction to the subject.
      Mr John C. Tarr's Good Handwriting and How to Acqire It
      is, alone of the books reviewed here, practical. He offers
      instructions in the acquisition of the chancery script and
      discusses bad hands of various kinds - a chapter which prompted
      personal disquiet in one reader, at least. Chancery is recommended
      for Clarity, Speed, Beauty, and Pleasantness. There is useful
      advice on pen-nibs, models to be imitated, margins, paper, and
      rational flourishes.
      'Who will deny'. Mr West demands, 'that a letter written by
      hand will impart something that is direct between friends, and
      that it is a gesture no machine can make?' I will. To assert
      this is to be guilty of a sentimental, anti-mechanistic bias with
      which handwriting - if it is to prosper in a machine age - should
      not be associated. William Morris (with whom modern handwriting
      has a direct link via Edward Johnston and Sir Sidney Cockerell -
      Morris' secretary) made the mistake of resisting the machine emotionally
      instead of attempting to humanise and improve its products. The
      machine  need not be 'inhuman': after all, the first italic type
      of Aldus Manutius, which has influenced even typewriter letters,
      was based on hand-written italic.
      Fairbank, Blunt, West, and Tarr all admire the Renaissance.
      It is to their credit that they do. The hand they recommend is
      charged with humanistic associations. As Mr West points out, 'to
