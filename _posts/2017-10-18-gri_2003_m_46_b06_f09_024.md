      BLACKHEATH

      16 September

      Dearest Sylvia:

      Looking back at one of your letters I considered the pictures you
      suggest for London Exhibitions. I think the ones you suggest are
      most suitable: Dressing Table and View from Attic for the London
      group sounds alright to me. Your idea of taking them to Kensing-
      ton on 24th is a good idea, too, if you don't find it too tiring.

      Here are two poems which are about my attitude to poetry. The
      poets referred to in the first one are Stevens (who tends to be a
      bit Olympian and elderly) and Cummings who is just too boyish at
      times:

      The loaves of autumn are baked for Stevens.
      The elderly avenues take auroras.
      He's lucky, but poor us,
      less adjusted to 'the painter's season.*

      Though short of Fall we're not so young as
      the boyish printemps merchant of sixty
      Who's again fixity.
      His name if you spring him is Cummings.

      Where shall we drop from Cummings' trapeze
      if it isn't into the lap of autumn,
      from high bar to the down
      where wounded forests collapse at a sneeze

      Midair were perfect, if we could wait
      between the most of gravity and flight.

      POET AT HOME

      The world is some poets' table
      tapping out yes like a mad thing,
      do you love, yes, girls, yes, land, yes,
      like a big hand for the fireman
      who saved the little girl and dog.

      I read such poems in less time
      than they took to write, can forget
      the spiels in moments of any day.
      I write on a table, too. It rocks,
      but is not jumping anywhere.

      Time for bed now, dearest Sylvia. I hope you sleep well. I love
      you so much.

      BLACKHEATH
      16 September
      Dearest Sylvia:
      Looking back at one of your letters I considered the pictures you
      suggest for London Exhibitions.  I think the ones you suggest are
      most suitable:  Dressing Table and View from Attic for the London
      Group sounds alright to me.  Your idea of taking them to Kensing-
      ton on 24th is a good idea, too, if yo don't find it too tiring.
      Here are two poems which are about my attitude to poetry.  The
      poets referred to in the first one are Stevens (who tends to be a
      bit Olymian and elderly) and Cummings who is just too boyish at
      times:

      The leaves of autumn are baked for Stevens.
      The elderly avenues take auroras.
      He's lucky, but poor us,
      less adjusted to 'the painter's season'.

      Though short of Fall we're not so young as
      the boyish pritemps merhant of sixty
      who's agin fixity.
      His name if you spring him is Cummings.

      Where shall we drop from Cummings' trapeze
      if it isn't into the lap of autumn,
      from high bar to the down
      where wounded forests collapse at a sneeze.

      Midair were perfect, if we could wait
      between the most of gravity and flight.

      POET AT HOME
      The world is some poets' table
      tapping out yes like a mad thing,
      do you love, yes, girls, yes, land, yes,
      like a big hand for the fireman
      who saved the little girl and dog.

      I read such poems in less time
      than they took to write, cna forget
      the spiels in moments of any day.
      I write on a table, too.  It rocks,
      but is not jumping everywhere.

      Time for bed, now, dearest Sylvia.  I hope you sleep well.  I love
      you so much.
