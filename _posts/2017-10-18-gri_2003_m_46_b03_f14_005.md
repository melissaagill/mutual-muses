      2. to-day I have, so far, done no work. this morning it poured with rain so I did washing ironing and shopping. This afternoon when I have posted this and made a milk pudding I hope to prime a canvas for "Frankie" and draw in roughly the composition for "Flight into Egypt." I intend to work for "Rinaldo and Armida" after that and am thinking of it, and your Bath capriccio.
      Clifford's interview went extremely well, and Professor Zangwill who interviewed him said that he wished the other syllabuses were as good as Clifford's. He is now officially admitted to the Oxford Board of Extra-mural Lecturers.  So that no one now can question his qualifications.

      I'm glad you had such an exciting foreign audience for your lecture - it must have been very stimulating - I hope you will get more such.  Did they ask any interesting questions.

      Good for Robert - what an excellent dinner it sounds
