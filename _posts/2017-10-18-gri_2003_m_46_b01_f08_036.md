      22 1x 1948
      Dearest Sylvia,
      Yes, on the 20th, at eleven I was thinking of you. I was up
      on the hill at [unclear]Ehem[/unclear] Castle. I remember thinking how amused
      you would have been at it and how interested on account
      of my own taste for [unclear]follies[/unclear] and the grotesque. This morning at
      that time I was at [unclear]another folly[/unclear], Brown's, this time, with a fine
      view and a great tower behind me. Tomorrow I shall be
      looking at Georgian Bath. I shall indeed be [unclear]conscious[/unclear]
      of you. The Roman Baths are an unexpected [unclear]relief[/unclear] in this [unclear]ervam[/unclear] lane as the [unclear]Louvre[/unclear] was - well [unclear]comparitioned[/unclear], so I
      hope  [unclear]to work it into a poem[/unclear] about Bath soon. Then you
      see I meet what is in effect your portrait on your at-
      titude [unclear]roundly[/unclear]: far more after, [unclear][/unclear], than pudgy
      homely Beau Nash's I am glad to record. All of these
      considerations are like [unclear]ribbons[/unclear] round a may pole -
      surf around an island, at the centre of which is my
      love for you, wild and continuing despite [unclear]our exile[/unclear]
      [unclear]sea, that thing[/unclear], appears unstable but I hope that [unclear]mostly[/unclear]
      its time your find yourself after to believe in my
      love. As for me, your letters constitute much, and
      I know you will not think me arrogrant if I say I [unclear]be-[/unclear]
