      Your solution of the Colour-lecture has an Appolonian sleight-of-hand about it - the minimum of trouble and the happy result combined. I am sure, too, your notes will help Clifford very much with what will be a fascinating lecture. Don't tell him but I feel like trying to hear him, if I can. We'll see nearer the time.

      Tell me how your lecture went - I long for news. I still think with pleasure and profit of your lecture on Monday.

      I love your letters for they give me, as my continual thoughts of you do not, new glimpses of your ravishing and varied personality. My memory dotes on adorable aspects of you know and loved already - your letters add something new to the fund of images, words, attitudes, and actions that make your lion forever yours by their fascination and beauty.

      I love you I love you
      Lawrence
