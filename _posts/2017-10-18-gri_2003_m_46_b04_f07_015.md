      [15-7-51]  Sunday  Dearest Sylvia,

      I have booked on the coach on Tuesday morning
      which leaves Lewisham at 9:32.  So I can
      catch the 12:30 bus (I think I've go the time
      right) to Pett.  I long to see you.  Will
      you tell the Woods this:  I am running out of
      stamps or I would write to them also.

      I am writing my article about war-films:  I'll
      bring it if it is finished.

      On Friday I went to the Laroon exhibition, it
      is delightful, and I am going again tomorrow.
      The N.G. have cleaned but not yet put on view
      Hobbema's Avenue and his Castle and two big
      late Canaletto's including the Grand Canal I
      showed at the Art School.

      In a few minutes I shall go and sit in the
      garden, it is warm and fitfully sunny.  I
      shall write, I think.  Here is a poem for
      you, dearest cat, only muse:

      THE COUNTRY, AT NIGHT, LATE SUMMER

      In the blue haystack needles spark
      Illusive, multitudinous:
      Pearls around a roman doric...

      Rural adjectives fall in rows
      As the scythe censors growth:
      Ample, yellow, thick, and close.

      Dearest Sylvia,

      I have booked on the coach on Tuesday morning
      which leaves Lewisham at 9.32. So I can
      catch the 12.30 bus (I think I've got the time

      I am writing my article about war-films: I'll
      bring it if it is finished.

      On Friday I went to the Laroon exhibition, it
      is delightful, and I am going again tomorrow.
      The N.G. have cleaned but not yet put on view
      Hobbema's Avenue and his Castle and two big
      late Canaletto's, including the Grand Canal I
      showed at the Art School.

      In a few minutes I shall go and sit in the
      garden, it is warm and fitfully sunny. I
      shall write, I think. Here is a poem for
      you, dearest cat, only muse:

      THE COUNTRY, AT NIGHT, LATE SUMMER

      In the blue haystack needles spark
      Illusive, multitudinous:
      Pearls around a roman doric...

      Rural adjectives fall in rows
      As the scythe censors growth:
      Ample, yellow, thick and close.

      THE SOCIETY FOR EDUCATION IN ART
      29 TAVISTOCK SQUARE LONDON WC 1

      Sunday

      Dearest Sylvia,

      I have booked on the coach on Tuesday morning
      which leaves Lewisham at 9.32. So I can
      catch the 12.30 bus (I think I've got the time
      right) to Pett. I long to see you. Will
      you tell the Woods this:  I am running out of
      stamps or I would write to them also.

      I am writing my article about war-films: I'll
      bring it if it is finished.

      On Friday I went to the Laroon exhibition, it
      is delightful, and I am going again tomorrow.
      The N.G. have cleaned but not yet put on view
      Hobbema's Avenue and his Castle and two big
      late Canaletto's, including the Grand Canal I
      showed at the Art School.

      In a few minutes I shall go and sit in the
      garden, if it is warm and fitfully sunny. I
      shall write, I think. Here is a poem for
      you, dearest cat, only muse:

      THE COUNTRY, AT NIGHT, LATE SUMMER

      In the blue haystack needles spark

      Pearls around a roman doric...

      Ample, yellow, thick, and close.
