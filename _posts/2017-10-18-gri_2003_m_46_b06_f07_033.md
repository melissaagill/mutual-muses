      AFTERNOON

      Not only slowly but at all
      the turgid fountain retches blood
      over the broken statues and the rocks
      blunt as unburied heads.
      The intricate veins nuzzle the wind.

      Unbuttoned and moronic sweet,
      the shape of sloppy innocence,
      wet from the dream, able to count
      more toes than ten, more heads than two.
      The nipple in your puckered tongue
      is new and old anatomy.

      LATER

      A slow boat for the staging of a no play
      idling via the ottomans of sunset.
      Islands delay the mantlepiece horizon.
      I'd love to get you on a slow boat to China
      thought there's nothing in China to equal you.
      Wake slowly, retarded by the occident.
      Slowly the wake uncoils, detumescently,
      on water dark and tangled like an octopus.
      The moon rolls like a tear along the sheets.
      The sea is honey and the boat our spoon.

      EVENING

      T The crinkled pyramid
         is Achilles to the earth
         shaded tortoise. Gone.
      The stark bridge ambles into the river.

         Latch of the clock seconds
         my hour and coming night.
         What pips crunch on the floor?
      The short bridge stops before the river ends.

      NIGHT

      People are walking home and beds are filled
      like books with markers where they were put down.
      A goods train jerks a tin orgasm
      and thuds its snake against the lowish clouds.

      Nobody stands in the shoes by the bed.
      The chair makes empty as the stubborn heaven.
      The tap spills in the white arena.
      Drowned knockings disfigure the plumber's veins.
