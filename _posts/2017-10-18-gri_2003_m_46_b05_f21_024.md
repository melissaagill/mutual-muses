      3 I can't do much more to R and A until I have finished Cliff End, except perhaps to put in a sky - but I would like to do that out of doors if possible - the same with the flowers - I wish the wind would drop - I hate it anyway.
      On your birthday I am going to Miss Campbell's to do a painting of her and she will do one of me! Which will be rather fun - I hope my cold is better by then!
      I will read Clifford what you say about Auden, but after having read Spears article - or nearly all of Spear's article I find it very difficult not to heartily agree with Clifford. One can over look, while disliking, his rejection of Eros and the world in general, for although it is not necessary to the Christian it is a line often taken - so that the Fall overshadows the God-created world and fresh - but to deny thee
