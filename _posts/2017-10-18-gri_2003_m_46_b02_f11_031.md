      say that I slept in England, in the North
      Among the sand-dunes pecked with feet of birds,
      Or flat upon the lawn of afternoon
      Measured the restless blossom of the spring,
      Or, on a Florentine eminence  traced
      The meaning of a hill-town in a stone:
      The point is that imagination tastes
      Italian certainties and Southern figures

         (4)
      Of the sequence of Trionfi I
      Encountered only one, rejecting those
      Symbolic of another world, and guilt:
      Aware in a bronze chariot,
      With two reliefs upon his throne, encircled
      By followers and symbols of his power
      Led his procession near the sleeper -
      Heraldic with the roses on his thigh.
