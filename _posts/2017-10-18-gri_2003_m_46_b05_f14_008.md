      I love you so much, my dearest, but in some ways we have such different standards as to make each incomprehensible or seem really silly or neurotic. It's a pity!

      I shall work very hard at my picture so that I may finish it and come up by the end of next week – Thursday or Friday I suppose would probably be a wise estimate. But if I can before I will – for I long to see you again and I think that it is bad for is to see so little of each other.

      I do hope you have a most successful tour – I shall probably feel much more cheerful by the time you have this – in fact I feel a little better now!

      I love you so much

      I love you

      Sylvia

      P.S. Don't forget to write to [unclear]Luis[/unclear] – perhaps a card? S.

      I love you so much, my dearest, but in some ways we have such different standards as to make each incomprehensible or seem merely silly or neurotic. It's a pity!
      I shall work very hard at my picture so that I may finish it and come up by the end of next week - Thursday or Friday I suppose would probably be a wise estimate, but if I can before I will - for I long to see you again and I think it is bad for us to see so little of each other.
      I do hope you have a most successful tour. I shall probably feel much more cheerful by the time you have this - in fact I feel a little better now!
      I love you so much
      I love you
      Sylvia
      p.s. Don't forget to write [unclear]to Jury[/unclear] - perhaps a card? S.
