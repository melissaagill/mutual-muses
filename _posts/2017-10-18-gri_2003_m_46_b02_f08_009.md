      3 EPIGRAM

      The helmet of your hair gives place at night
      To the superb disorder of the sea
      Folding upon the pillow like a wave,
      Our eyelids shells, I lie beside you, love,
      The pillow now the shore, your hair the sea
      I swim in, not by day, but best at night.

      4 SOME WAYS OF LOOKING AT A LANDSCAPE

      Suppose the landscape is a desert
      Where ruins shoulder rocks aside like dirt:
      Conceive it as an asymmetric plot
      As Tudor as you like. Or has it got
      The long low english character of downs:
      Perhaps a church subscribes a hat for clowns
      Phallic or heavenly. A choice agrees
      With predisposed pathetic fallacies.
      The view to us has an empathic quiver
      And shows our own reflections like a river:
      But I will take the place on pagan terms,
      Establish Pan in every bush and urn,
      And advertise for dryads in the trees.]That is one choice of several fallacies.

      5 SONG

      The earthquake in my heart removed
      The gothic city and the plain
      Littered with temples of my pain.
      Your love the first destroyer proved.

      Your love was next an architect
      Who sets up ports and open squares
      To catch the sunlight and the air.
      The city was your will intact.

      Return my love to empty graceful streets
      Designed by you, these tubs of flowers,
      And sun that gilds the slender towers.
      We'll meet at time's triumphal gate.

      I love you
      Lawrence

      3 EPIGRAM

      The helmet of your hair gives place at night
      To the superb disorder of the sea
      Folding upon the pillow I like to wave,
      Our eyelids shells, I lie beside you, love,
      The pillow now the shore, your hair the sea
      I swim in, not by day, but best at night.

      4 SOME WAYS OF LOOKING AT A LANDSCAPE

      Suppose the landscape is a desert
      Where ruins shoulder rocks aside like dirt:
      Conceive it as an asymmetric plot
      As Tudor as you like.  Or has it got
      The long low english character of downs:
      Perhaps a church subscribes a hat for clowns
      Phallic or heavenly.  A choice agrees
      With predisposed pathetic fallacies.
      The view to us has an empathic quiver,
      And shows our own reflections like a river:
      But I will take the place on pagan terms,
      Establish Pan in every bush and urn,
      And advertise for dryads in the trees.
      Than is one choice of several fallacies.

      5 SONG

      The earthquake in my heart removed
      The gothic city and the plain
      Littered with temples of my pain
      Your love the first destoyer proved.

      Your love was next an architect
      Who sets up ports and open squares
      To catch the sunlight and the air.
      The city was your will intact.

      Return my love you empty graceful streets
      Designed by you, these tubs of flowers,
      And sun that gilds the spender towers.
      We'll meet at time's triumphal gate.

      I love you
      Lawrence
