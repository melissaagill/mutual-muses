      Dearest Lawrence
      A note to say that as Michael is going back first thing on Monday come as soon as possible - T and C say.
      As a footnote - M. suggests that in the next number of 'Athene' you are a little more explicit in the advertisement as to how to obtain Athene and how much the annual subscription is. He says he would like to have it, but would not know how to set about getting it.
      With much love from us all!
      I love you Sylvia
