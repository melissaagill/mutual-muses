      3 i went back to tea with Mrs [unclear] Ludgates [/unclear] neighbour Mme Heintz. I managed to identify a tea-pot that had puzzled her a very fine salt-glazed stoneware! She seemed interested in my show and asked for cards-and so as to keep me as long as possible sent to me to the station in a taxi! I lectured with out notes and the president couldn't restrain her admiration for my coat! I wore all my jewels and felt very smart! My coat is deliciously warm and light.
      I think there is a [unclear] team [/unclear] on Saturday arriving at 12.10. I will check. I will go to the tea room if so (Charing X of course) unless you will be at the N.G. in which cased I will go there.

      3 I went back to tea with Mrs Ludgates neighbour Mrs Heintz, I managed to identify a tea-pot that had puzzled her a very fine salt-glazed stoneware! She seemed interested in my show and asked for cards - and so as to keep me as long as possible sent me to the station in a taxi! I lectured without notes and the president couldn't restrain her admiration for my coat! I wore all my jewels and felt very smart! My coat is deliciously warm and light.
      I think there is a train on Saturday arriving at 12.10. I will check. I will go to the tea room if so (Charing X of course) unless you will be at the N.G in which case I will go there.
