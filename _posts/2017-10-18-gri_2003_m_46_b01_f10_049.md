      23rd November 11, Mansel Road.

      Dearest Sylvia,

      If Michael is going back to the gallery I think it is a good thing. But I hope you will not hang upon his decision for if you do I fear that he will go on being ambivalent for the rest of our days. I love you. This period without you is so difficult to bear for I desire so much to be with you.

      I went to Tooth's yesterday and saw Devis, Hayman, Zoffany, and Guardi. The latter's pictures were two Island Capricios. This title charmed me and suggested images which eventually developed into this poem which has a bearing on us now. The deep sea with its beasts is our loveless past, the shore our future together - the lagoon of stanza two, between the water and the Island (of Cythera) is where we are now, in sight of satisfaction but not yet landed.

      The green fathoms diminish,
      Our wake lingers
      Upon the hollow sea,
      Where whales of solitude
      Buttress the dim halls
      And octopi hunger for roses.

      Nearing an island
      We see the coral floor,
      Rising from the dark
      Yield to the sun,
      Vivid and elegant.

      The wanves flutter
      On golden shelves of sand
      Beside the conches,
      Wind moves the feathered trees
      Coloured by fruit galore:
      These symbols welcome lovers.

      Viewed on the map, among
      Dolphins and decollated winds,
      The island and the sea
      Lack names, but lovers know
      Their future and their past.

      I saw Johnson (made him come to the Hong-Kong instead of the Salad-Bowl_ and he said how nice it was a Pett but told a lover none of the things he wanted to know. Didn't even say what you wore...

      Your description of the sunset is lovely - it flares again in my imagination, in your words. You have written me a poem, darling, thank you for it.

      I love you,

      Lawrence

      Dearest Sylvia,

      If Michael is going back to the gallery I think it is a good thing. But I hope you will not hang upon his decision for if you do I fear that he will go on being ambivalent for the rest of our days. I love you. This period without you is so difficult to bear for I desire so much to be with you.

      I went to Tooth's yesterday and saw Devis, Hayman, Zoffany, and Guardi. The latter's pictures were two Island Cappricios. This title charmed me and suggested images which eventually developed into this poem which has a bearing on us now. The deep sea with its beasts is our loveless past, the shore out future together - the lagoon of stanza two, between the water and the Island (of Cythera) is where we are now, in sight of satisfaction but not yet landed.

      The green fathoms diminish,
      Our wake lingers
      Upon the hollow sea,
      Where whales of solitude
      Buttress the dim halls
      And octopi hunger for roses.

      Nearing an island
      We see the coral floor,
      Rising from the dark,
      Yield to the sun,
      Vivid and elegant.

      The waves flutter
      On golden shelves of sand
      Beside the couches,
      Wind moves the feathered trees
      Coloured by fruit galore:
      These symbols welcome lovers.

      Viewed on the map, among
      Dolphins and decollated winds,
      The island and the sea
      Lack names, but lovers know
      Their future and their past.

      I saw Johnson (made him come to the Hong-Kong instead of the Salad-Bowl) and he said how nice it was at Pett but told a lover none of the things he wanted to know. Didn't even say what you wore...

      Your description of the sunset is lovely - it flames again in my imagination, in your words. You have written me a poem, darling, thank you for it.

      I love you,
      Lawrence

      But I hope you will not hang upon his decision for if\nyou do I fear that he
      will go on being ambivalent for the rest\nof our days. I love you. This period

      \nI went to Tooth's yesterday and saw Davis, Hayman, Zoffany,\nand Guardi. The
      latters pictures were two Island Cappricics.\nThis title charmed me and suggested
      images which eventually de- \n veloped into this poem which has a bearing on
      us now. The deep \nsea with its beasts is our loveless past, the shore our future
      \ntogether- lagoon of stanza two, between the water and the \nIsland of Cythern
      is where we are now, sight of satis-\nfaction but not yet landed.\n\nThe green

      the dim hills\nAnd occupy hunger for roses.\n\nNearing an island \nWe see the
      coral floor,\nRising from the dark,\nYield to the sun,\nVivid and elegant.\n\nThe
      waves flutter \nOn golden shelves of sand\nBeside the conches,\nWind moves the
      feathered trees\nColoured by fruit galore:\nThese symbols welcome lovers.\n\nViewed
      on the map, among \nDolphins and decollated winds,\nThe island and the sea \nLack
