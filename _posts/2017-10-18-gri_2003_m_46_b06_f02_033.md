      I gather that you have been told about the
      cards for the show. Chase said he would ring
      you. They should certainly come next week
      sometime. When I complained about that, he sug-
      gested 200 emergency cards be printed quickly
      until the right card comes. I told him - best
      to ring you. I am going to ring again to-
      morrow morning to find out exactly the sit-
      uation. It is too bad about the delay - I
      let Chase see my disgust - but there is still
      time as you know. 10 days before the opening is the
      gallery's usual date for sending cards off. We
      still have time.

      I thought your Arch. Rev. note exactly
      what is needed. I will take my cue for some
      of my votes from that.

      8th March (Sunday) to 15th is my period at
      Checkheaton.
      I will get Perzelly's picture next week.
      Relax this weekend as far as you can, darling.
      I am working for our exhibition and I do love you
      I love you
