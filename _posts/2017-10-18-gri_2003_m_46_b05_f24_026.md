      Ditchling      21.12.52

      Dearest Lawrence
           I hope your lecture went well and you have a lot of work behind you now!  The party went very well - they are a very pleasant friendly lot of people.  While you were lecturing I was buttering and cutting 5 doz. bridge rolls in preparation.  I thought tenderly of you.
         We had hot cyder punch and cheese straws and talked all [unclear]sonirel[/unclear] for the 1st 1/2 hour or more then we played charades - divided into 4 groups.  Seven words were suggested and each group had to make up a little play incorporating the seven words.
