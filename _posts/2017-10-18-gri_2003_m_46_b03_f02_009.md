      II

      Today I may find time to see one of those Italian films. I shall try. Tomorrow I must read and start my review of the Fitzgerald book for World Review so I cannot start writing about Hogarth quite yet alas.

      I seem to be rather overwhelmed with things to do, at the moment. I still have something of the consequent anxiety and felt rather headachy and stiff this morning. But, since a bath, I feel more human and soon I must to town: washing, shopping, film, and, finally, the debate. I enclose a card showing you what it is.

      I love you, dearest, I love you
      Lawrence
