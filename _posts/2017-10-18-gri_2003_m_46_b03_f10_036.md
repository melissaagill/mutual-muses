      NOCTURNAL SONNET FOR SYLVIA
      Is the moon, mild in the mist,
      A huntress with a heart of ice,
      A prison of comet craters,
      An orb for obvious lovers?
      Poets enamoured of Phoebus
      Criticise his lunar sister:
      And astronomers allude
      To lack of verdure in the airless vales.
      What vow did Verlaine overhear,
      What lamp was lit for Verlaine?
      That he praised Diana's speed?
      For me the moon is a coin
      On the counter of the night
      Buying dreams of Sylvia.
      FLORAL SONNET FOR SYLVIA
      The tawny bouquet on the table,
      Balanced on a crystal axle,
      Is the crest of autumn, ripe
      like a Venetian pastoral.
      Moisture flashes in the petals'
      Overlapping complex wheels:
      Unruly silhouetted shapes,
      Dark on the wall, resemble owls.
      But their beauty is not final
      Lacking that lyrical
      Sense of order which your hands
      Communicate to willing blooms:
      Would you were here to double
      My pleasures in the sensual.

      NOCTURNAL SONNET FOR SYLVIA

      Is the moon, mild in the mist,
      A huntress with a heart of ice,
      A prison of comet craters,
      An orb for obvious lovers?

      Poets enamoured of Phoebus
      Criticise his lunar sister:
      And astronomers allude
      To lack of verdure in the airless vales.

      What vow did Verlaine overhear?
      What lamp was lit for Verlaine?
      That he praised Diana's speed?

      For me the moon is a coin
      On the counter of the night
      Buying dreams of Sylvia.


      FLORAL SONNET FOR SYLVIA

      The tawny bouquet on the table,
      Balanced on a crystal axle,
      Is the crest of autumn, ripe
      like a Venetian pastoral.

      Moisture flashes in the petals'
      Overlapping complex wheels:
      Unruly silhouetted shapes,
      Dark on the wall, resemble owls.

      But their beauty is not final
      Lacking that lyrical
      Sense of order which your hands
      Communicate to willing blooms:

      Would you were here to double
      My pleasures in the sensual.

      NOCTURNAL SONNET FOR SYLVIA
      Is the moon, mild in the mist,
      A huntress with a heart of ice,
      A prison of comet craters,
      An orb for obvious lovers?

      Poets enamoured of Phoebus
      Criticise his lunar sister:
      And astronomers allude
      To lack of verdure in the airless vales.

      What vow did Verlaine overhear,
      What lamp was lit for Verlaine?
      That he praised Diana's speed?

      For me the moon is a coin
      On the counter of the night
      Buying dreams of Sylvia.

      FLORAL SONNET FOR SYLVIA
      The tawny bouquet on the table,
      Balanced on a crystal axle,
