      My dearest Sylvia
      I was delighted to receive two letters
      from you yesterday evening on my return
      home.
      I do hope that your cold is not develop-
      ing seriously. Perhaps once you have
      time to recover from the oppressive coach
      ride it will disappear altogether.
      Fancy your coach catching up with me!
      I wish - I do wish that I had seen you
      once more - even fleetingly.
      It is reassuring news that the Woods
      are not in bad spirits - I am pleased to
      hear that. I hope you will not be
      sad at Pett this time.
      Thank you for the cuttings (I am think-
      ing about them) and the negative (which
      I will hand over tomorrow after my lecture).
