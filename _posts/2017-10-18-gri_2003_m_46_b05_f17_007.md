      5    Perhaps you will tell me something
      about it, did many people come?
      I think your modern British postcards
      must have been both interesting and
      amusing--for you know such a lot
      about that period.
      I am glad to say that the play
      has gone extremely well both nights
      and there was no need of my services
      a prompted at all--but I did
      various odd jobs in the intervals, messages
      and piling up people's sashes--little
      girls--and helping them with
      chrysanthemums in their hair.  There
      was only a very slight hiatus on the
      first night when the Emperor's teeth
      slipped in the middle of is "chippy
      choppy" song--he informed me after-
      ward--that it was because he had
      cleaned them!  We had packed houses
      both nights and over 20 clear will
      be handed over for Clifford's organ!
      He made a nice little speech on
      the first night.

      5   Perhaps you will tell me something
      about it, did many people come?
      I think your modern British portrayals
      must have been both interesting and
      amusing - for you know such a lot
      about that period.
      I am glad to say that the play
      has gone extremely well both nights
      and there was no need of my services
      as prompter at all - but I did
      various odd jobs ; the intervals, messages
      and picking up people's sashes - little
      girls - and helping them with
      chrysanthemums in their hair. There
      was only a very slight hiatus on the
      first night when the Emperor's teeth
      slipped in the middle of his "chippy
      choppy" song - he informed me after-
      wards that it was because he had
      cleaned them! We had packed houses
      both nights and over Â£20 clear will
      be handed over for Clifford's organ!
      he made a nice little speech on
      the first night
