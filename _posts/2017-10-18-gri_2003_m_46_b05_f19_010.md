      2 finances are groggy - but you have hardly had time to recover them what with Bank holiday etc. perhaps things will cheer up a bit next week.
      Did the young man who had the [unclear]Bushingtons[/unclear] pay you back yet? I was going over my accounts and noticed the cheque - perhaps I could have it?
      I enclose an advertisement for Bristol Art Gallery. - it may interest you - you would certainly get it I feel if you had the Birmingham qualifications!
      I have nearly finished the "[unclear]Tyre Turners[/unclear]" as I understand it is called I had hoped to finish it to-day but it has been so showery and windy that it is impossible to work out of doors so I turned out the front spare room in preparation for Mrs Clark. She is coming on Monday, in time to catch the quarter to 5 bus, which is most convenient ad I can do a little shopping first.
