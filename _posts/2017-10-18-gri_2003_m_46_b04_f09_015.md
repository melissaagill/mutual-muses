      12 ix 1951

      Dearest Sylvia,
      Here are some poems for you, at last.  The Soliloquy On The Beach is the one I began at Pett some while ago.  The one For An Aunt was prompted by my jealously of Aunt Margaret being with you when I was not.  Oh, and Maria Montez is a film star, drowned in her bath the other day: she played Queons of Atlantis and that kind of role.
      Carlyle must have been an odd man.  He came to see Holman Hunt.  Attacked indignantly The Light of the World (that's alright - I'mwith him here) but then complimented the painter on the effect of moonlight in The Awakening Conscience..!
      The weather here is very windy but not, despite fitful clouds, wet.  Perhaps it is similar at Pett and you are able to paint.  I hope to.  At least you will have your indoor models if the cricket pitch gate is unsuitable.
      I have just had another letter from Russell offering me another B'ham lecture (Maclaren Young having fallen out).  I'm delighted to accept as you can imagine.  (I've sent him ATHENE too.)
