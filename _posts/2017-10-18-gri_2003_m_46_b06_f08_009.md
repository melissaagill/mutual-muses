    clean_transcription: My NG lectures have gone very pleasantly - 110 people at
      Giorgione-Titian; 90 people to 18c. genre in which I took the opportunity to
      plug Pietro Longhi to such effect, incidentally, that  after the lecture one
      man rushed off, bought a photograph of a Longhi & had me sign it!  Also the
      Smiths were there unexpectedly.  They asked kindly after you.  They tell me
      I am to be invited to give monthly lectures to the community centre at Bansted
      in addition to the weekly WE ones at Mrs. Siedlers.  Today I am going to Wimbledon.  Mandy
      is there on holiday and I shall enjoy seeing her again.  ( I am writing this
      letter on the journey, as I expect my writing reveals.)  Do give Beryl my love
      and please give Diana Imber a suitable greeting also when you see her.  (tho'
      not her children).  I doubt if Frankie would accept any message from me or anybody
      else so don't bother about that either.  I love and adore you my dearest Sylvia.  Love
      you Lawrence
