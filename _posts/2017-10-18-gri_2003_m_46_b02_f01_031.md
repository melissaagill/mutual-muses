      I enclose a proof of my Hogarth re-
      view which may interest you: I must have
      been so rude to Ayrton the editor has
      left it out. I think it's probably bet-
      ter for it. What I have not enclosed
      this time is a postal order for Tiny but
      there was a vast queue at the Post Office.
      I shan't forget.

           THE ARROW OF LOVE

           This boy - roses in his bottom -
           Agile as pollen in the wind -
           Aims his bow, and fires, the feather
           Is like a butterfly in the air.

           But, symbol of a major will,
           His arrow's barbed - so if we pull
           The flesh must tear - we must succumb,
          Enclose the arrow with cur flesh.

      My dearest Sylvia, my rose, I love
      you. I know my love disturbs you and
      that your love for me disturbs you too.
      Do not fear it for that reason - and, I
      ask you, do not feel frightened about
      my part in your future. I shall love
      and protect you; adore you and receive
      my inspiration from you.

      Oh, I love you, Lawrence

      I enclose a proof of my Hogarth re-
      view which may interest you: I must have been so rude to Ayrton the editor has left it out. I think it's probably bet-
      ter for it. What I have not enclosed this time is a postal order for Tiny but there was a vast queue at the post Office. I shan't forget.

      THE ARROW OF LOVE

      This boy - roses in his bottom -
      Agile as pollen in the wind -
      Aims his bow, and fires, the feather
      Is like a butterfly in the air.

      But, symbol of a major will,
      His arrow's barbed - so if we pull
      The flesh must tear - we must succumb,
      Enclose the arrow with our flesh.

      My dearest Sylvia, my rose, I love you. I know my love disturbs you and that your love for me disturbs you too. Do not fear it for that reason - and, I ask you, do not feel frightened about my part in your future. I shall love and protect you, adore you and receive my inspiration from you.

      Oh, I love you, Lawrence
