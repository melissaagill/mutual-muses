      SYLVIA SLEIGH
      Pett   11.9.50

      Dearest Lawrence,
      I hope you have had an amus-
      ing week-end at Brighton, and some
      good weather - I wonder if you
      bathed - not good enough here
      I hope you did not have an uncomfort-
      able rush because of my letter.
      I am excited about Polydore -
      how lovely.  I can't imagine how the
      temptation will be!
      The weather is too grey to finish
      the landscape this morning but I
      hope to finish or nearly finish the
      portrait this afternoon.  Tiny will
      be able to sit for me a bit now
      too.
      I read a rather dull review in the
      "Times" of the Childrens Exhibition -
      apparently it is very colourful
      I have nothing a bit interesting
      to tell you - except that I am
      enjoying "Great Morning" very much

      Dearest Lawrence,
      I hope you have had an amusing week-end at Brighton, and some good weather - I wonder if you bathed - not good enough here. I hope you did not have an uncomfortable rush because of my letter.
      I am excited about Polydore - how lovely. I can't imagine how the temptation will  be!
      The weather is too grey to finish the landscape this morning but I hope to finish or nearly finish the portrait this afternoon. Tiny will be able to sit for me a bit now too.
      I read a rather dull review in the "Times" of the Children's Exhibition - apparently it is very colourful.
      I have nothing a bit interesting to tell you - except that I am enjoying "[unclear]French[/unclear] Morning" very much
