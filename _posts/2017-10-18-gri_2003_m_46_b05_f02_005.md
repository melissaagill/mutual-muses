      Dearest Sylvia
      Your letter saddens me for, though I felt very
      guilty at my stupidity I hoped it was not large
      in your mind.  As often I err on the side of
      easiness--as you say.  I cannot defend my-
      self, only reproach myself.
      Your pessimism about human beings re-
      presses what I have assumed to be the case gen-
      erally speaking but with you it is urgent and
      unhappy in a way that makes my gloom nomin-
      al and trivial.  When we don ot meet reg-
      ularly I become chaotic, superficial.  I do
      not want to be dependant on you in the way
      that M is (decisions referred to you, for ex-
      ample) but I do need your standards and
      above all your love.  I cannot feel com-
      plete without you.  Just now I feel a cor-
      rupt and superficial character.  I love you
      so dearly Sylvia.  You are my life, my light
      side.  Return soon.  Your painting progresses
      with such speed that I hope, oh how I hope that you
      will be with me again at latest by the middle of
      next week.  Do not be fearful or melan-
      choly.  I keep going over in my mind plans
      for your exhibitions and this makes me hopeful
      and confident.
