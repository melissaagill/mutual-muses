      II

      It describes a Dutch version of Autumn as a Personage:

      Geography imposes form
      On local habits of imagination:
      And climate models the moustache
      Or dykes the character of boats.
      Autumn, the Boor, stands tall
      Above the flat horizon
      Holding a barrel to his lips
      Above his comrade-belly.
      No Bacchus, here, nor buttocks stained
      With purple like a woman's chin.
      Provincial, wide, and popular
      The personage September
      Adopts the local character
      And belches like the thunder.

      Your description of the progress of your painting
      fills me with pleasure. What size is it? I long to
      see it for I am sure it combines all you have learnt
      from the watercolours of the cliff with your delectable handling of
      oils.

      Friday evening Paul, Michael Rivett, a friend of Paul's called Desmond, and I went to a music hall
      in Camden Town. It was very amusing. There was an
      effort to recreate the primitive atmosphere of the 'old
      days': enormous mirrors beside the stage-boxes reflect
      Sickertian views of the dark auditorium and I must con-
      fess my attention was distracted more than once from the
      players to the exciting image in the glass. Usually
      in music halls the jokes are re-actionary but Camden
      Town topical jokes are anti-conservative: 'What are
      you smiling for, missus' said a comedian, 'if the con-
      servatives get in, those teeth'll have to go back'.

      I find Willy's delay in answering as annoying as you
      do. Probably more annoying, for I am longing to see
      you again.

      II
      It describes a Dutch version of Autumn as a Personage:

      Geography impedes form
      On local habitats of imagination:
      And climate models the mustache
      Or dykes the character of boats.
      Autumn, the Boor, stands tall
      Above the flat horizon
      Holding a barrel to his lips
      Above his comrade-belly.
      No Bacchus, here, nor buttocks stained
      With purple like a woman's chin.
      Provincial, wide, and popular
      The personage September
      Adopts the local character
      And belches like the thunder.

       Your description of the progress of your painting
      fills me with pleasure. What size is is? I long to
      see it for I am sure it combines all you have learnt
      from the watercolours with your delectable handling of
      oils.

      Friday evening Paul, Michael Rivett, a friend
      of Paul's called Desmond, and I went to a music hall
      in Campden Town. It was very amusing. There was an
      effort to recreate the primitive atmosphere of the 'old
      days': enormous mirrors beside the stage-boxes reflect
      Sickertain views of the dark auditorium and I must con-
      fess my attention was distracted more than once from the
      players to the exciting image in the glass. Usually
      in music halls the jokes are re-actionary but Campden
      Town tropical jokes are anti-conservative: 'What are
      you smilin' for, missus' said a comedian, 'if the con-
      servatives get in, those teeth'll have to go back'.

      I do find Willy's delay in answering as annoying as you
      do. Probably more annoying, for I am longing to see
      you again.
