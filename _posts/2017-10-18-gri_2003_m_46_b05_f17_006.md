      opinion of it - at present I find it [unclear]student[/unclear] and vicious - perhaps that is how it should as, on the whole, I hate cities. One needs to be rich or on holiday to enjoy them. I will take care of the copy and bring it with me, unless you would like it before that. I have re-read several times the [unclear]Saturnation Ditty[/unclear] which I like very much though the imagery is rather spiteful I think. What's in has to come out, I suppose.
      I shall look forward to reading your Pasmore [unclear]astiele[/unclear]. My Art News hasn't come this week which is disappointing. I can't say I'm glad to hear that Iris is writing for it. I have not confidence in her judgement and little appreciation of her style. I hope the editor of her paper likes the idea about your westerns.

      I have re-read several times the
      Saturnalia ditty - which I like very
      much though the imagery is rather spiteful

      I shall look forward to reading
      your Pasmore article - my Art
      News hasn't come this week which
      is disappointing. I can't say I'm
      glad to hear that Iris is hunting for

      judgement and little appreciation
      of her style. I hope the Editor of
      her paper likes the idea about your
      westerns.

      hear your lecture on the [unclear]Pauster-Scalpfois[/unclear]
