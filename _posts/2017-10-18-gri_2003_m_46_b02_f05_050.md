      Whose intimate reflection
      Flash in the folding waves.
      Summer is [unclear]faint[/unclear] and simplicity -
      And [unclear]have[/unclear] the parallel.

      Perhaps is is a hint too long (the middle stanza may be unnecessary) but it uses the seahorse images with which we were surrounded today. No, more than that: the shore was more than a background in the way of Titian - it was something lyrical and [unclear]integrated[/unclear] with us. The gold in the sea, the lean elegant perspective of the short, a sea-weed flower. Oh, it must be pages since I said how passionately and tenderly I love you - Sylvia, oh must, see how you inspire me when you have left me but 90 minutes ago.
      We are at Tunbridge Wells. Oh, sorry Tunbridge Wells central! You will be making this journey soon.

Oh, it must be pages since I said how passionately and tenderly I love you-Sylvia, oh muse, see how you inspire me when you have left me but 90 minutes ago.
