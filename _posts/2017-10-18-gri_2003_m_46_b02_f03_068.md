      Thursday
      The Aubreys
      Dearest Sylvia

      Thank you for your letter which came this morning with one from the Pooles telling me that they are leaving on the morning of April 5th.  I think that is Tuesday.  I shall leave here, I suppose, on the 4th, go to Banstead, stay the night at Wimbledon, and go in on the 5th.

      This morning I went to St. Albans to see the hypocaust (really only the tepidarium remains) and it was well worth the journey and I had time to visit the museum again.  I enclose a poor post-card of it:  the colour is dark red, brown, purple, blue-gray, and buff and the whole fresher than appears in the photograph.  At the far end is a fragment of a later mosaic whose workmanship makes one appreciate the firmness of the (2nd example.

      Here is another piece of a topographical poem, about the fine weather of last week in Harpenden:

      A crisp day:  sunlight spatters
      Upon the view you painted in the rain.

      The sun lectures the twisted trees â€”
      And gamins run for cover in each leaf.

      The warm air sucks the birds upon the trees
      . . . .

      The Aubreys                  Thursday
      Dearest Sylvia
      Thank you for your letter which came this morn-
      ing with one from the Pooles telling me that they
      are leaving on the morning of April 5th.  I think
      that is Tuesday.  I shall leave here, I suppose,
      on the 4th, go to Banstead, stay the night at
      Wimbledon, and go in on the 5th.
      This morning I went to St Albans to see the
      hypnocaust (really only the tepidarium remains)
      and it was well worht the journey and I had time
      to visit the museum again.  I enclose a poor
      post-card of it: the colour is dark red, brown,
      purple, blue-grey, and buff and the whole fresher than ap-
      pears in the photograph. At the far end is a frag-
      ment of a late mosaic whose workmanship makes
      one appreciate the firmness of the (2nd example.
      Here is another piece of a topographical poem,
      about the fine weather of last week in Harpenden:
      A crisp day: sunlight spatters
      Upon the view you painted in the rain.
      The sun lectures the twisted trees-
      And gamins run for cover in each leaf.
      The warm air sucks the buds upon the trees
      ....
