      iv.
          Today I am going to see the Renoirs at Lefévre. Vuillard I'm afraid will not be seen by me, as admission is 2s. 6D. and I doubt Lefévre prestige will get me in free as it used too. However, I saw much of him in Paris. By the way: Vuillard Clifford, Sartre, reminds me. The new Sartre play opens at the Lyric Hammersmith next week (15th or 16th) and I intend to see it at least once before coming to Pett on the 18th. So I shall have some news of it when I come.
          How I love you. Even Fureli reminds me of you now. The associations that link you with me are becoming more and more numerous. more and more direct. Surely in this way Sartre's theory of the unavailability of one person to another is invalidated. Your personality is present in the poetry I have written lately/ My sensibility is in part taken over by yours. On more exactly 'my sensibility is being added to, & thus altered, by yours? This I think is literally true and by no means a conceit as enlargement of truth.
          Lastly a prose poem:
      Who is she? A woman in love. Why does she sleep? It is to dream. Why does she smile? She has good news. Where does she live? In the world. What does she carry? It is her heart.
          Sylvia, I adore you.
          Lawrence
