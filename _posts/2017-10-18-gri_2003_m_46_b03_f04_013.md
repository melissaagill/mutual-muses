      THE MASQUE OF WATER   THREE

      Lion:

      No, pastiche will not afford my love the proper vessel, to drink in, or for voyages.

      The Masque:

      The Source speaks:

      Great waterfalls are plumes hills wear
      In the process of becoming:
      Lakes in which girls see themselves like sculpture
      Have the certainty of being.

      Baroque cascades plunge like heroes
      Down to lance the blue drake death.
      The lake is fatal as a mirror
      To the chained girl, lacking clothes.

      But the water-falling hero
      Stuns the drake and breaks the rigour
      Of doubles in a standing lake -
      And makes Angelica a moving figure.

      A Native River-God speaks:

      The marriage of Thames and Tiber
      Reconciles our native green
      With the white of statuary:
      Commingling urns import
      Nymphs and emperors to our banks
      And a sense of southern order.
      How the marble, tall on sky,
      Is example to our muscles,
      And a solid thing-in-itself.

      The marriage of Thames and the Nile,
      Of the swan and pyramid,
      Introduces Love not Order:
      On the Oriental couch,
      Supported by a crocodile,
      Pumped and plushed, Cleopatra
      Lounges horizontally.
      Palm and willow rise and fall
      Round the rising and falling loves.

      Lakes in which girls see themselves like sculpture
      Have the certainly of being.

      Baroque cascades plunge like heroes
      Down to lance the blue drake death.
      The lake is fatal as a mirror
      To the chained girl, lacking clothes.

      But the water-falling hero
      Stuns the drake and breaks the rigour
      Of doubles in a standing lake -
      And makes Angelica a moving figure.

      A Native River-God speaks:

      The marriage of Thames and Tiber
      Reconciles our native green
      With the white of statuary:
      Commingling urns import
      Nymphs and emperors to our banks
      And a sense of southern order.
      How the marble, tall on sky,
      Is example to our muscles,
      And a solid thing-in-itself.

      The marriage of Thames and the Nile,
      Of the swan and pyramid,
      Introduces Love not Order:
      Supported by a crocodile,
      Pumped and plushed, Cleopatra
      Lounges horizonally.
      Palm and willow rise and fall
      Round the rising and falling loves.

      THE MASQUE OF WATER   THREE

      The Source speaks:
      Great waterfalls are plumes hills wear
      In the process of becoming:
      Lakes in which girls see themselves like sculpture

      Down to lance the blue drake death.
      The lake is fatal as a mirror
      To the chained girl, lacking clothes.
