      Although the uncertain future makes the present unbearable (I know you must feel the temptation to relax and stay with M.) do remember the past with M.  I am so happy that you are re-reading my poems, dearest this is nice to me, do see them all as the evidence of love.  If you stayed with M you would not perhaps feel guilt but would you really have something to put in the place of my love?  I know I should have nothing because I love you so intensely and completely.
