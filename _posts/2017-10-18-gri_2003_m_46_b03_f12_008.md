      Lawrence, \n     I hope the exhibition is enjoyable for you and the visitors
      pleasant!  I feel most excited about it and shall very much look forward to
      hearing all about it.  (I had 6 private view cards from the Kensington Galleries.
      \ I shall send one to Dr. Gainsborough.)  I am most delighted that my works
      should be asked for.  I hope John Paul and Eric have lent some exciting things.
      \ Is Paul sending any sculptures?\n     I'm sorry Charlels is ill.  How dull!
      \ I wrote to Muriel to tell her about the Kensington Galleries and ask for Mrs.
      [unclear]Taft's[/unclear] address and suggested that I should go over one day.
      \ Would you mind if I did?  I expect you could come too if you liked!  Muriel
      suggested Thursday 11th or Frid. 12th.  I should like to fit in [unclear][/unclear]"
