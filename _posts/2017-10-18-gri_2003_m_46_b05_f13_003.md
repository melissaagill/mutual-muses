      Pett 1.1.52
      Dearest Lawrence
      I hope you have a very happy New Year, full of honour and propsperity.
      Thank you so much for collecting my pictures. I am delighted to hear that they arrived unscathed. I hope it was fairly convenient - it sounds as if it were - I gather that you did not contact W. Coop for me. Unless they want to fill the place up I am sure we have wasted our time and money, for unless a member of the hanging committee is directed to a name an unknown person stands no chance at all, of this I become more and more convinced, all the reviews suggest this.
      I have told Mrs [unclear]Soft [/unclear] of some of your lectures - perhaps she may come.

      Dearet Lawrence,
      I hope you  have a very happy new year, full of honour and properity!
      Thank you so much for collecting my pictures I am delighted to hear that they arrived unscathed. I hope it was fairly convenient - it sounds as if it were - I gather that you did not contact W. Coop for me. Unless they want to fill the place up I am sure we have wasted our time and money, for unless a member of the hanging committee is directed to a name and unknown person stands no chance at all, of this I become more and more convinced, all the reviews suggests this.
      I have told Mrs Loft of some of your lectures - perhaps she may come.
