      Dearest Lawrence,

      Thank you so much for your
      letters and the remarkable
      poems - I think them very [unclear]excit[/unclear]-
      ing and novel - I am not
      sure yet how much I "like" them,
      but I feel they are important,
      and worth a good deal of
      perusal. I shall read them
      diligently to-morrow.

      You will be glad to hear I have
      dove a little more to my land-
      scape - some more to the wall
      and the [unclear]piramid[/unclear] of the tomb.

      I am so glad of your success
      with your German lecture - I wish
      I had heard it - I think you
      soon should do some Rembrandt
      Pictures though for you might
      appreciate him more if you
      studied him. I have never
      [unclear]read[/unclear] [unclear]?[/unclear] of George [unclear]Barker-Thrush[/unclear]

      Dearest Lawrence,
      Thank you so much for your Letters and remarkable poems. I think them very exciting and novel. I am not sure yet how much I "like" them, but I feel they are important, and worth a good deal of perusal. I shall read them diligently to-morrow.

      I am so glad of your success with your German lecture - I wish I had heard it. I think you soon should do some Rembrandt lectures, thought for you, might appreciate him more if you studied him. I have never [unclear]read any[/unclear] of George Barker - I must
