      Dearest Sylvia,
          Thank you for your letter-card- I am so pleased to know
      that you had an enjoyable Christmas. I adore your card- an
      enchanting achievement.  I love it from [unclear][/unclear] on a motor-
      bicycle - thank you, dearest.
        I am sorry Tiny seemed unwell- I hope she is better now
      My Christmas was really very enjoyable o the best one yet
      at Wimbledon. I am sorry its one- whereas in the past I
      have not always felt that as you know Everyone was darn-
      ing, the food was superb, the parties successful. My god-
      child no longer screams at the sight of me- on the contrary
      we get on well. Oh and altogether - everything was smooth
      & friendly
       Paul Harding came to the Wimbledon party: Paul Soutley
      vary up , I hope to see him in a day or two.
       I hope you will see your aunt soon. These are my
      lecturing dates: 1st January, 3rd, 6th, 8th, 13th, 17th,
      Banstead starts 14th. otherwise I am free at present. I
      ought to think to lecture at Banstead on 21st ( to get it
      firmly established) so that means not coming to Pett
      until the day of my lecture, the 22nd But I can stay
      until the end of the month, if I may.

      Dearest Sylvia,
      Thank you for your letter-card - I am so pleased to know
      that you had an enjoyable Christmas. I adore your card - an
      enchanting achievement. I love it from [unclear]Yambella[/unclear] on a water-
      bicycle to the lion footsman and Lionel & Warrily themselves.
      Again - thank you, dearest.

      I am sorry Tiny seemed unwell - I hope she is better now.

      My Christmas was really very enjoyable - the best one yet
      at Wimbledon. I am sorry it's ones- whereas in the past I
      have not always felt that, as you know. Everyone was charm-
      ing, the food was superb, the parties successful. My god-
      child no longer screams at the sight of me - on the contrary
      we get on well. Oh and altogether - everything was smooth
      & friendly.

      Paul Harding came to the Wimbledon party: Paul sourly
      rang up, I hope to see him in a day or two.

      I hope you will see your aunt soon. These are my
      lecturing dates: 1st January, 3rd, 6th, 8th, 13th, 17th,
      Bamstead starts 14th. Otherwise I am free at present. I
      ought to think to lecture at Bamstead on 21st (to get it
      firmly established) so that means not coming to Pett
      until the day of my lecture, the 22nd. But I can stay
      until the end of the month, if I may.
