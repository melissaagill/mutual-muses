      c2 1941 (I)
      Nostalgia, as for center lost
      Somewhere in asymmetry
      Of the town or shapeless sea,
      Governed my early step, and pressed
      A curfew on the door.

      Synonymous for age were mute
      In the hooves of darkened luck
      & the stone of home I sucked
      Resisted weather like a butte
      Whose shadow spanned the floor.

      Regret & silence ruled my state
      Like sand that infiltrates a house
      As if it were on hourglass,
      A sign of squalour and Fate,
      The drying [unclear][/unclear].

      Now I can analyse or quote
      The adolescent on the porch
      Using human hair as a torch.
      Have I really changed my coat
      As the calendar its law?

      [unclear]C2[/unclear] 1941

      Nostalgia, as for center lost
      Somewhere in asymmetry
      Of the town or shapeless sea,
      Governed my early step, and pressed
      A curfew on the door.

      Synonyms for an age mere mute
      In the [unclear]hooves[/unclear] of darkened luck
      & The [unclear]stone[/unclear] of home I sucked
      Resisted [unclear]weather[/unclear] like a butte
      Whose shadow spanned the floor.

      Regret & silence ruled my state
      Like sand that infiltrated a house
      As if it were an hourglass,
      A sign of squalor and fate,
      The drying [unclear]Fructider[/unclear]

      Now I can analyse our quote
      The adolescent on the porch
      Using human hair as a torch.
      Have I really [unclear]changed[/unclear] my coat
      As the calendar its law?
