      future I shall certainly address my letters more fully. Even though it means
      sacrificing the Nicholsonian simplicity of Rectory Lodge, PETT, Sussex, I cannot
      bear that letters intended for you should go to littlehampton and orpington
      (!) so'nr. Eastings' will go on in future.\n\nYour account of my portrait's
      refusal to unbend vexes the original very much. When I come to Pett I shall
      surreptitiously (spelling?) effect an exchange- send my portrait back with the
      lantern slides and take the portrait's place so you will, I think, have no more
      complaints of inattention. \n\nAbout Michael's coming and going. What can I
      say? That is, except I love you and I say this with fervour and sincerity, my
      darling. I love you.\n\nI am not entirely sure about my trousers. Michael (It's
      a dream, it's Harella) Rivett said they would be alright in London where people
      would understand that 'the effect' was deliberate. Molly had misgivings. Gossip?
      I don't recall any. The evening was curiously elevated. Jung, Mithra, Oracles,
      Guilt, Confession, and me in my strongest anti-Christian vein (thinking of similar
      tirades by yourself). Iris is planning a book on the social background of English
      art- for school use, which is useful, don't you think? Iris' friend, Andre something,
      a novelist of adventure, rather than an adventurous novelist, talked with me
      about my book from a technical point of view which was helpful.\n\nI have got
      a superb glimpse of Hogarth's unconscious from Jung. I was reading him as a
      change from H after finishing three chapters and came on it almost at once.

      Dearest Sylvia,

      In future I shall certainly address my letters more fully. Even though it means sacrificing the Nicholsonian simplicity of Rectory Lodge, PETT, Sussex, I cannot bear that letters intended for you should go to littlehampton and orpinton (!) so'nr. Hastings will go on in future.

      Your account of my portrait's refusal to unbend vexes the original very much. When I come to Pett I shall surreptitiously (spelling?) effect an exchange - send my portrait back with the lantern slides and take the portrait's place so you will, I think, have no more complaints of the inattention.

      About Michael's coming and going. What can I say? That is, except I love you and I say this with fervour and sincerity, my darling. I love you.

      I am not entirely sure about my trousers. Michael (It's a dream, it's Harella) Rivett said they would be alright in London where people would understand that 'the effect' was deliberate. Molly had misgivings. Gossip? I don't recall any. The evening was curiously elevated. Jung, Mithra, Oracles, Guilt, Confession and me in my strongest anti-Christian vein (thinking of similar tirades by yourself). Iris is planning a book on the social background of English art - for school use, which is useful, don't you think? Iris' friend, Andre something, a novelist of adventure, rather than an adventurous novelist, talked with me about my book from a technical point of view which was helpful.

      Sylvia,<br/><br/>In future I shall certainly address my letters more<br/>fully.
      Even though it means sacrificing the Nichol-<br/>sonian simplicity of Rectory
      Lodge, PETT, Sussex, I can-<br/>not bear that letters intended for you should
      go to <br/>littlehampton and orpington (!) so 'nr. Hastings' will<br/>go on
      in future.<br/><br/>Your account of my portrait's refusal to unbend<br/>vexes
      the original very much. When I come to Pett I<br/>shall surreptitiously (spelling?)
      effect an exchange - <br/>send my portrait back with the lantern slides and
      take<br/>the portrait's place so you will, I think, have no<br/>more complaints
      of inattention.<br/><br/>About Michael's coming and going. What can I say?<br/>That
      is, except I love you and I say this with fervour<br/>and sincerity, my darling.
      I love you.<br/><br/>I am not entirely sure about my trousers. Michael<br/>(It's
      a dream, it's Harella) Rivett said they would be<br/>alright in London where
      people would understand that<br/>'the effect' was deliberate. Molly had misgivings.<br/>Gossip?
      I don't recall any. The evening was curious-<br/>ly elevated. Jung, Mithra,
      Oracles, Guilt, Confession,<br/>and me in my strongest anti-Christian vein (thinking
