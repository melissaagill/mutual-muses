      Thursday
      My dearest love,
      I hope you are well - less tired and that, now the Woods are back, they will give you a feast. How much I enjoyed our lunch on Monday which you made so nicely. Tuesday night I eat everything up as you instructed so there has been no waste of food you will be glad to hear.
      Last night at the lecture one or two people asked after you and I told them I believed you were paint-ing. Mrs Smith said she had so liked your discussion of Revelations. Mr Smith had been again to Hampton Court - comparing its pictures with those of Vienna & Munich. I talked for a long time last night - and I think it was successful. I did not get away until 10 o'clock.
      Charles has given me 4 or 5 school lectures in the next month or so. He seems to give me first choice after Claire - before Mrs King, &c. I cannot tell you Redcar dates until Friday when I am going to see John Shipp again and draw up a rough out - line of the improved 'Pictures & Picture-Making' ex-hibition. (I shall throw out the section on Texture for one thing.) This will get us some money. The part - time lectures at Hammersmith are directly under

      Thursday
      My dearest love,
      I hope you are well less tired and that.Now the Woods are back they'll give you a feast. How much I enjoyed our lunch on Monday which you made so nicely. Tuesday night I ate everything up as you instructed so there has been no waste of food you  will be glad to hear.
      Last Night at the lecture one or two people asked after you and I told them that I believed you were painting. Ms Smith said she so liked your discussion on revelations. Ms Smith had been again to Hampton Court comparing the pictures with those of Vienna and Munich. I talked for a long time last night and I think it was successful I did not get away until 10 o'clock.
      Charles has given me 4 or 5 School lectures in the next month or so. He seems to give me first choice after Claire before mrs King , [unclear] . I cannot tell you Redcar dates until Friday when I am going to see John Shipp again and draw up a rough outline of the [unclear][/unclear] 'pictures & picture and making' exhibition (I shall throw out the section on texture for one thing). This will get us some money. The part time lectures at Hammersmith are directly under
