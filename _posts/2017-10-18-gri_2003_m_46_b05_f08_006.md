      I saw Molly in the morning and she told me Mandy is going into hospital in town for an operation on her foot. She will be in there 4 days or so and meanwhile Betty is going to stay at Wimbledon (despite the workmen). Apparently poor Mandy is still nagged at by her parents, tho' to a slighter extent. She has failed some school exam. She is very unhappy for the exam. result came just after one of the 'young friends ' told her she was illegitimate. She refuses to see any of the group she used to play with and is very bitter to <unclear : the wife?: unclear> Betty & the wretched Digger. Who would blame her? Molly tries to console her but without apparent success. Still at least Molly may make Mandy aware of an alternative way -of -life to that of her parents.
      If my cat should feel sad or idle may I suggest you read some Thurber. I expect Clifford has some and I have just been reading him with enormous pleasure.If you have access to none I will send you My Life and Hard Times <underlined>
      I hope you had a happy bank holiday.
      I love and adore you
      Lawrence

      In the clearing out I found a clothes brush, bound volumes of the R.A. Illustrated (1888 -1905 or 7), lots of old drawings (by me). I think the R A volumes will amuse you very much. Again, Sylvia, I love you L.

    annotation_text: I saw Molly in the morning and she told me Mandy is going into
      hospital in town for an operation on her foot. She will be in there 4 days or
      so and meanwhile Betty is going to stay at Wimbledon (despite the workmen).
      Apparently poor Mandy is still nagged by her parents , tho' to a slighter extent.
      She has failed some school exam. She is very unhappy, for the exam. result came
      just after one of the 'young friends' told her she was illegitimate. She refuses
      to see any of the group she used to play with and is very bitter to Betty and
      the wretched Digger. Who would blame her? Molly the vile tries to console her
      but without apparent success. Still at least Molly may make Mandy aware of an
      alternative way-of-life to that of her parents.                                                               If
      my Cat should feel sad or idle may I suggest you read some Thurber. I expect
      Clifford has some and I have just been reading him with enormous pleasure. If
      you have access to none I will send you My Life & Hard Times.                                                    I
      hope you had a happy bank holiday.                                 I love &
      adore you                                                                 P.S.
      In cleaning out I found a clothes-brush, bound volumes of the R.A. Illustrated
      (1888-1905 or 7), lots of old drawings (by me). I think the R.A. volumes will
      amuse you very much.                                  Again, Sylvia, I love
      you L.
