      Dearest Lawrence,
      I hope you are no too tired.  I
      remember that you are very busy this
      week, and as it is still so cold
      it is rather weary!  I hope you
      enjoyed the Blackheath film show--
      do tell me about it, and how your
      lectures went.  Tiny is going to find
      out full particulars of size and
      places of application for films for
      the school projector.  I will let you
      know as soon as possible.  I will
      make a big poster to put in a sus-
      picious place, and sell tickets at
      my jewelry stall.
      You will be pleased to hear that
      I have nearly finished my still life
      I am now working on the cup--
      having finished the mantlepiece.
      It is going very well.  Clifford and
      Marjorie think it very good.  I
      have bought an address book and

      Dearest Lawrence,
      I hope you are not too tired - I
      remember that you are very busy this
      week, and as it is still so cold
      it is rather wearing! I hope you
      enjoyed the Blackheath film show-
      do tell me about it, and how your
      Lectures went. Tiny is going to find
      out full particulars of size and
      places of application for films for
      the School projector. I will let you
      know as soon as possible. I will
      make a big poster to put in a cons-
      picuous place, and sell tickets at
      my jewellery stall.
      You will be pleased to hear that
      I have nearly finished my still life
      I am now working on the cup -
      having finished the mantlepiece.
      It is going very well - Clifford and
      Marjorie think it very good. I
      have bought an address book and
