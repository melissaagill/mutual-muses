      Pett. 18.3.52
      Dearest Lawrence
      What a splendid letter - poems, drawings and news - I do like the "cutting" from "Lion News & Review" Dandy looks very [unclear]fish[/unclear] standing before his home!
      I am sleeping very well on the whole - I find it better not to read in bed; otherwise I read too long and become over-tired - I seem to sleep better if I settle down at once. Clifford's cold is still rather bad - he should not have lectured yesterday really - he is staying in bed today. However he is better. Thre is very little to do with the dresses G. gave me - zip of one, shoulder pads of the other. I must read "The[unclear] Princess[/unclear]" I read only bits of it long ago.
      How did you like the exh: your [unclear]design [/unclear]does it please? I wonder if it is influential - ! I expect with the few with brains
