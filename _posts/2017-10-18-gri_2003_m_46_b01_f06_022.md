      sitting for you; this privilege increased my critical delight in your handling of oils. You must never stop painting again. Your silent period has not improved your gift in the least; not in landscape and not emphatically in portraiture. I will not say you have been lucky but rather that you have been tough, persistent so that there is nothing unexpected about your new work. You have improved it. And how I enjoyed your earlier work! Your portrait of Clifford and Tiny sticks in my mind (the double one) and Clifford's head. And your nude self-portrait remains very vivid indeed to me; I reflect that you understand yourself as well as other people. How interesting it will be to compare it with your new self portrait against the [unclear]liger[/unclear]. But now that I have started I could go on for many more lines than a letter really permits about your paintings. For example the fresh self-portrait with its charming greens and gusty nervous vigour in it and the wonderfully strong rhythms, on such a large scale, of those three flowers drawings - heroic tulips. But it is a theme that will run through many future letters, I am poet [unclear]Basineate[/unclear] to Queen See, and you are my painter in return.
      Your letters have given me such pleasure; so loved, so tender. I see, too, with what delight I need not say, that conceits enter your letters. As my past gradually assembles itself on memories of

How interesting it will  be to compare it with your new self portrait against the light. But now I have started I could go on for many more lines than a letter really permits about your paintings.

      delight in your handling of oils.<br/>You must never stop painting again. Your<br/>silent
      period has not impaired your gifts <br/>in the least: not in landscape and not,
      em-<br/>phatically, in portraiture. I will not say<br/>you have been lucky but
      rather that you<br/>have been tough, persistent, so that there is<br/>nothing
      unexpected about your new work.<br/>You have prepared it. And how I enjoyed<br/>your
      earlier work! Your portrait of Clif-<br/>ford and Tiny sticks in my mind (the
      double<br/>one) and Clifford''s head. And your nude<br/>self-portrait remains
      very vivid indeed<br/> to me: I reflect that you understand your-<br/>self as
      well as other people. How inter-<br/>esting it will be to compare it with your<br/>new
      self-portrait against the light.<br/>But now that I have started I could go
      on<br/>for many more lines than a letter really<br/>permits about your paintings.
