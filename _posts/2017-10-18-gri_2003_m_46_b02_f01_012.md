      17th January 1949 11 Mansel Road Wimbledon

      Oh my Dearest, writing to you again after being with you is a poor substitute. The pain of your leaving at Victoria was dulled by incredulity that in a few minutes you would not really be there. Your beauty, your vivid gestures, your speech, your love, fill my imagination like roses.

      I do hope that your journey to Hastings was comfortable. Did you see the sunset which reminded me of the 'gate of living pearl'? Once at Pett I cannot express how strongly I will for the minimum pain for yourself and Michael - even as you leave him. My thoughts are with you all the time and when you think of me you can be sure that I am writing for or about you or preparing for our future.

      I am so sorry for the discomforts of our stay at Mrs Clewitt's and I am distressed when I think of your being unwell and yet journeying about with me in the cold. I treasure your courage even as I am sad at the need for it. How Happy I was during our ten days in the Black Country - despite the difficulties. Being with you is a wonderful experience after so many glimpses and separations. You are in my mind now - not merely a life-accepting figure, but a life-welcoming one. Thank you so much for accompanying me to the Midlands and here words sound flat so I hope that my love thanked you.

      This morning I went to Blackheath: it took just under 25 minutes by train from Charing Cross and just under 10 minutes to walk from the station to 109, Blackheath Park. The walk is along a charming road, lined with trees and all kinds of houses, many of them pleasant Victorian and late Gregorian ones. I saw our room and decided to take it: it is separated from the house and we shall have to cross a small courtyard to get to the main building where a large 'lounge' with many armchairs is available to us at any time. The house is Victorian and not too tastefully furnished: long windows however and a cast-iron verandah. Our room is smallish, with two windows, double bed, hot and cold water in the room, gas-fire, wardrobe with mirror on it, arm chair, &c. Here is a rough sketch of it. On the next page The ceiling is not high. Thinking in terms of weeks we will probably be there about 6 or 7 weeks. Mrs Gardiner may be able to put us in the house later on if you like. It is on the first floor and we go up a flight of stairs to it. I had a look at Blackheath afterwards, though casually, and it seemed nice, quite pretty, a sort of Hampstead. Blackheath and our road is very quiet. I looked at 107 where our flat is to be and its situation is very nice, overlooking a wide view. I told our landlady - who seems to be pleasant though 'genteel', and not fussy or neurotic - I would come in about a week and that you would be arriving in about two weeks. She knows I write and that you write and paint and seemed to approve. A Post-script: the

      Oh my Dearest, writing to you again after being with you is a
      poor substitute.  The pain of your leaving at Victoria was
      dulled by incredulity that in a few minutes you would not
      really be there.  Your beauty, your vivid gestures, your
      speech, your love, fill my imagination like roses.

      I do hope that your jouney to Hastings was comfortable.
      Did you see the sunset which reminds me of the 'gate of liv-
      ing pearl'?  Once at Pett I cannot express how strongly I
      will for the minimum pain for yourself and Michael, even
      as you leave him.  My thoughts are with you all the time
      and when you think of me you can be sure that I am writing
      for or about you or preparing for our future.

      I am so sorry for the discomfors of our stay at Mrs Clew-
      itt's, and I am distressed when I think of your being unwell
      and yet journeying about with me in the cold.  I treasure
      your courage even as I am sad at the need for it.  How Happy
      I was during our ten days in the Black Country, despite the
      difficulties.  Being with you is a wonderful experience
      after so many glimpses and separations.  You are in my mind
      now, not merely a life-accepting figure, but a life-welcom-
      ing one.  Thank you so much for accompanying me to the Mid-
      lands and here words sound flat so I hope that my love thanked
      you.

      This morning I went to Blackheath: it took just under 25 min-
      utes be train from Charing Cross and just under 10 minutes to
      walk from the station to 109, Blackheath Park.  The walk is
