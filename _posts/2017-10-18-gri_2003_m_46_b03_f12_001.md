      Pelt 3.5.50

      Dearest Lawrence,

      Thank you for your letter and the charming
      drawings of Chiswick. How was my [unclear]Leonessa[/unclear]?
      I am so glad that repairs are going ahead.

      I'm so sorry to be rude about Ray Howard-
      [unclear]Jones[/unclear] its not so bad for a woman!
      I hope you had a pleasant evening.
      Thank you so much for delivering my pictures
      I mustn't leave the frames so late [unclear]as this
      time[/unclear], but start looking now for the
      "[unclear]Women[/unclear]" and the A. IA.

      I took the "Kensington" water-colours to
      the carrier, the other end of Hastings-
      he says he will unpack them and deliver
      them safely - but it will cost me
      12/6 ! and of course they will be
      delivered on Friday. I hope [unclear]his[/unclear]-
      Marchant won't mind- I am sending
      her the papers to-day so that she will
      know. I think it better [unclear]than[/unclear] that
      you should go- but I do resent
      the charge - its [unclear]more[/unclear] than my fare!
      If I [unclear]thought[/unclear] I should sell something

      I'm so sorry to be rude about Ray Howard Jones it's not so bad for a woman! I hope you had a pleasant evening. Thank you so much for delivering my pictures. I musn't leave the [unclear]Franies[/unclear] so late another time, but start looking now for the "women" and the A.IA.

      I took the "Kensington" water colours to the [unclear]Cassier[/unclear], the other end of Hastings--he says he will unpack them and deliver them safely -- but it will cost me 12/6! and of course they will be delivered on Friday. I hope Mrs. Marchand won't mind - I am sending her the papers today so that she will know. I think it better than that you should go - but I do resent the charge - its more than my fare!

      Dearest Lawrence,
           Thank you for your letter and the charming drawings of Chiswick.  How was my Leonessa? I am so glad that repairs are going ahead.
           I'm so sorry to be rude about Ray Howard Jones it's not so bad for a woman! I hope you has a pleasant evening.
      Thank you so much for delivering my pictures.  I mustn't leave the frames so late [unclear] an this[/unclear] time,  but start looking now for the "Women" and the A-1A.
      I tool the "Kensington" water colours to to the carrier, the other end of Hastings. he says he will unpack them and deliver them safely - but it will cost me 12/6 ! and of course they will be delivered on Friday. I hope Mrs Marchant won't mind  - I am sending her the papers today so that she will know.  I think it better than that you should go - but I do resent the charge - it's more than my fare!  If I thought I should sell something
