      Like teeth in a comb the rushes rise
      And little plaster swags
      Hang like multiplying boughs.
      Bamboo conspires to hide the steps.
      The portico caves in.

      White buds folded in the pond
      Are like shells embedded
      In the melancholy grot:
      A green iron seat
      Assuage solitude.

      Mist softens here and there an edge
      But it is not the day I miss.
      Hadrian's vases are chipped:
      But it is not the Earl I mourn
      Nor the collapse of his estate.

      Not for the lost heroic past
      Does this tear tremble over sight
      Obscuring the passive garden.
      It is not Time I mourn but you
      Who once walked with me in this view.
