         You will be pleased to hear that my toe is much better.  I showed it to Clifford on Monday night and it was already much improved as it was yesterday.  I haven't looked to-day yet - but it is much flatter and I think it will not show when it is healed.  You will also be pleased to hear that I have done a good deal more of Tiny's portrait in the garden.  What Paul calls the Spinx it is getting on very nicely.  Tiny sat very faithfully, and in between I worked on the landscape.  I have also washed part of the stair carpet and unpicked a chair for reupholstering - as well as roasting a duck (which was most delicious) and making pastry so I feel most virtuous!

      toe is much better - I showed <br/>it to Clifford on Monday night <br/>and it
      was already much im-<br/>proved as it was yesterday - <br/>I haven't looked
      to-day yet - <br/>but it is much flatter and I <br/>think it will not show when
      it <br/>is healed. You will also be pleased <br/>to hear that I have done a
      <br/>good deal more of things postried <br/>in the garden - what Paul calls
      the<br/>Sphinx it is getting on very nicely. <br/><br/>Tiny sat very faithfully,
      and <br/>in between I worked on the land-<br/>scape. I have also washed part
      <br/>of the stair-carpet and unpicked <br/>a chair for reupholstering - as well
      <br/>as roasting a duck (which <br/>was most delicious) and making <br/>pastry
      so I feel most virtuous!
