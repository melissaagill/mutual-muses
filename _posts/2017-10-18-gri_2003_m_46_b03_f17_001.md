      [unclear]Pelt[/unclear] 11-10-50
      Dearest Lawrence,
      I hope you had a useful interview with Gainsborough and that your lecture went well - for it must be over [unclear]120[/unclear] as its 25 to eleven and Clifford will be back soon.
      My journey was not too bad but terribly stuffy until we got to Pembury as people were smoking and all the windows were shut. I probably opened them when we stopped - to everyone's surprise for they did not know they opened! and the rest of the journey was well ventilated. When it was time to start our own way, everyone being assembled except one child in the back seat apparently traveling alone, the driver looked round for her, and eventually she appeared, her mouth [unclear]cramed[/unclear] to capacity and a sandwich in each hand rather like this. She had the largest fattest, [unclear]roddest[/unclear] face I've ever seen!

    clean_transcription: 11-10-50 Pett Dearest Lawrence,<br/>I hope you had a useful
      interview<br/>with Gainsborough and that your lecture<br/>went well - for it
      must be over now<br/>as its 25 to eleven and Clifford will<br/>be back soon.<br/>My
      journey was not too bad<br/>but terribly stuffy until we got <br/>to Pembury,
      as people were smoking<br/>and all the windows were shut. I<br/>properly opened
      them when we<br/>stopped - to everyone's surprise for they<br/>did not know
      they oppenned! and<br/>the rest of the journey was well<br/>ventilated. When
      it was time to start<br/>on our way, everyone being assembled<br/>except one
      child in the back seat<br/>apparently traveling alone, the driver<br/>looked
      round for her, and eventually<br/>she appeared, her mouth crammed <br/>to capacity
      and a sandwich in<br/>each hand she had the largest<br/>rather like fattest,
      reddest<br/>this face I've ever seen!<br/>
