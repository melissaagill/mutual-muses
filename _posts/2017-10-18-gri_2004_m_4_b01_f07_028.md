      Dearest Sylvia

      Your delightful letter came this morning to please
      and charm your sleepy lion, supplementing elegant
      memories of you on Wednesday.  How beautiful your
      movements are.  Remembering what you like I shall
      give you my news first, though not until I have said,
      once, quickly, how much I love you.

      After you left on Wednesday I finished the chapter upon
      which I was working.  I propose to work on H.
      all over the week-end also.

      Yesterday I collected the R.B.A. forms, went to Christ-
      ies for the Hayman, and then to the A.I.A. meeting in
      the evening.  On Tuesday I and another committee mem-
      ber are going to see the work of Mary Feddon (J. Trev-
      elyan's wife) to see if her work merits showing at the
      gallery.  I also went to the Herald Tribune office
      and found, in Tuesday April 11th, the cutting I enclose.
      It is from a column of intellectual news by Eugene
      Jolas, the editor of Transition.  I am very pleased
      to have his praise.  I shall send him an article soon
      when I can think of the right subject for him.

      Here is a sketch of the Hayman Leap Frogging (I have
      a photograph of it):

      Although I wrote down the prices of your pictures at
      great length I have mislaid the paper.  I have not

      Dearest Sylvia

      Your delightful letter came this morning to please and charm your sleepy lion, supplementing elegant memories of you on Wednesday. How beautiful your movements are. Remembering what you like I shall give you my news first, though not until I have said, once, quickly, how much I love you.

      After you left on Wednesday I finished the chapter upon which I was working. I propose to work on H. all over the week-end also.

      Yesterday I collected the R.B.A. forms, went to Christies for the Hayman, and then to the A.I.A. meting in the evening. On Tuesday I and another committee member are going to see the work of Mary Feddon (J. Trevelyan's wife) to see if her work merits showing at the gallery. I also went to the Heral Tribune office and found, in Tuesday April 11th, the cutting I enclose. It is from a column of intellectual news by Eugene Jolas, the editor of Transition. I am very pleased to have his praise.  I shall send him an article soon when I can think of the right subject for him.
