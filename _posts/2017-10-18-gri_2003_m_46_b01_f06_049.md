      Monday.
      I was right about the weather. I have sunbathed all day, reading a book at the same time. Mind and body have thus benefitted. The Hotel des Estargers is celebrated for having housed Rimbaud for a time: he was being supported by a musician who, [unclear]hammered[/unclear] thew him out when Rimbaud pissed in the bottle of [unclear](bourgious)][/unclear] milk he had left every morning. Rimbaud and Apollinaire: how I envy you in les hamelles de Tiresias. I wish I could explain it but I know very little about it, alas. I'm sure it amply compensated for 'Tosca'. I did write a letter to Hotel Racine: did you think to enquire there before going to Italy? Thank goodness you are alright for Italy: what dreadful misgivings you must have had. Congratulations on passing your exam. (In case you missed my letter to the Hotel Racine I passed too.) I agree with you about the [unclear]Mantegnas de Isabella D'este[/unclear] ones are my favorite, though I greatly admire the small crucifixion.
      This letter should reach you not later than Thursday. I am told that air mail to Italy takes one to three days. By the way if you get an opportunity see the Italian film (I don't know the original title) by Rosselino "Germany-year-Zero", do not miss it, for gods' sake. Nor the Italian version of The Postman Always Rings Twice: I have seen stills of a disturbing beauty from this latter piece.

      I was right about the weather, I have sunbathed all day, reading a book at the same time. Mind and body have thus benefited. And this morning your letter came to soothe and pleasure me.  the Hotel des Estrangers is celebrated for having housed Rimbaud for a time; he was being supported by a musician who, however, threw him out when Rimbaud pissed in the bottle of  (bourgeous) milk he had left every morning.  Rimbuad to Apollinaire: how I envy you 'les [unclear][/unclear] I wish I could explain it, but I know very little about it alas, I write it amply compensated for 'Tosca'.  I did write a letter to [unclear]the Hotel Racine: did you think to inquire there [/unclear]before going to Italy?  Thank goodness you are alright for Italy: what dreadful misgivings you must have had.   Congratulations on passing your exam (In case you missed my letter to the Hotel Racine I passed too.)  I agree with you about all Mantegna's: the Isabella D'Este ones are my favourites, though I greatly admire all small [unclear].
      This letter should reach you not later than Thursday.  I am told that air mail can take one to three days. By the way if you get an opportunity see the Italian film (I don't know its original title) Rosselire "Germany - [unclear] Zero" do no miss it, for God's sake.  Nor the Italian version of the Postman always Rings Twice: I have seen stills of a disturbing beauty from this latter piece.
      I am writing poste restante a Firenze as you suggest.  But I'll write to the address I have in [unclear] unless you instruct me otherwise. Dinner is nearly [unclear] so I must stop now. I'll send it off immediately after my fried - onions (which I now adore) and fried apples,
      I love you
       Laurence
