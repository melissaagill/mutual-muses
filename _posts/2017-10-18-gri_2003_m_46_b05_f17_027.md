    clean_transcription: 2.it makes me very happy -- Clifford has<br/>already started
      the "doubting" campagne<br/>and in spite of myself I begin to<br/>feel uneasy.  He
      also said that <br/>he thought I was getting a fanatic<br/>about art -- an artistic
      Savonarola <br/>and that I had better be careful<br/>not to become boring!  This
      because<br/>I denounced J.B. Priestly and <br/>refused to see any good in him
      --<br/>We spent the rest of the evening talking<br/>about  Marie and sex! Please
      forget<br/>anything personal I may have told<br/>you about him as apparently
      I<br/>shouldn't have -- I don't think I<br/>told you anything much -- anyway<br/>you
      musn't know -- I think this<br/>is because you are not considered<br/>sympathetic
      enough -- I had a bit<br/>more about Americanism -- but<br/>in spite of this
      heinous crime Clifford<br/>seems very fond of you.<br/>
