      Dearest Lawrence
      I feel terribly frustrated the wind is still a gale force, and the only [unclear]feasible[/unclear] place is the rose garden but Michael is managing between the [unclear]Showers[/unclear] in Panel Lane. If the weather improves I shall get on with it. [unclear]As[/unclear] I hope every day in the mean time I am getting long needed household work done. Yesterday when working by the church I made a small hole in my canvas - for it was pitch - and suddenly and violently [unclear]Breward[/unclear]  on the shape point at the back of my chair.
      I have no news - or nothing comes to mind, I think I must leave this letter until later for then I shall think of something to say.

      feel terribly frustrated the wind <br/>is still a gale force, and the only<br/>possible
      place is the rose garden<br/>but Michael is managing between<br/>the showers
      in Panel Lane - If the<br/>weather improves I shall get on<br/>with it.  As
      I hope every day<br/>in the mean time I am getting long <br/>heeded household
      work done<br/>Yesterday when working by the <br/>church I made a small hole
      <br/>in my canvas - for it was pitch-<br/>ed suddenly and violently .reward
      on the sharpe point at the back <br/>of my chaise.<br/>I have no news - or nothing<br/>comes
      to mind, I think I must<br/>leave this letter until later for then<br/>I shall
      think of something to say.<br/>
