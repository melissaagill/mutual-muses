      Pett 12.7.52
      Dearest Lawrence,
      Thank you for your letter - I am so sorry not to have got mine off in time to you - I finished it in order to catch the 4.30 post - but rushed off without it to catch the tide at 3.15. It was very rough and windy, but sunny and I enjoyed it. I also noted that I had not allowed for enough undulation in my sea scene! After I had bathed I did not paint but I went to the Cliff end and found the spot for my new painting. I really must do an afternoon water colour of it as well for it looks just like an Italian landscape by John Robert Cousins against the light

    clean_transcription: Pelt   12.7.52<br/>Dearest Lawrence,<br/>Thank you for your
      letter - I <br/>am so sorry not to have got mine off<br/>in time to you - I
      finished it in<br/>order to catch the 4.30 post - but<br/>rushed off without
      it to catch the<br/>tide at 3.15. It was very rough<br/>and windy, but sunny
      and I en-<br/>joyed it- I also noted that I had<br/>not allowed for enough undulation<br/>in
      my sea scene! After I had <br/>bathed I did not paint but I<br/>went to the
      Cliff end and found <br/>the spot for my new painting.<br/>I really must do
      an afternoon water<br/>colour of it as well for it looks<br/>just like an Italian
      landscape by<br/>John Robert Cousins against the light
