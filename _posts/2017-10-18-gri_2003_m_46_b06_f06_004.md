      Blackheath
      Friday
      Dearest Sylvia

      Thank you for your letter. Let me know what train you are
      coming on and I will meet you.  I mention this now as there may
      not be time to confirm it - but I will meet whatever train
      you name.

      I am so glad that you enjoyed the coronation and drank the
      Queen's health. ([unclear]The I where [/unclear]do sound a tense family.   I am glad
      that there's less conflict in Frances' family.)  You will be
      able to see the Coronation on 3-D, wide screen, technicolor
      films, if you want to, when you come to town.

      Parmore, the other day, was charming. He chattered about so
      many things beside abstract art!  I have never  [unclear]??? [/unclear]him get
      off [unclear]slop[/unclear] before.  It was very pleasant.

      John and Magda came 1st yesterday: Frank came after tea (he had been at a recording session).  Everybody admired again
      Ajax.  Magda adored Hetty: John does, too - he had told Magda all about it.  I borrowed the money from mother and so
      entertained them quite lavishly.  I read them the treatment
      of my sound play which they like so all that remains is to
      write it.  Probable title: THE TRAVEL AGENT.   The songs i have written already won't do.  I have to scrap my 1st draft.

      Argus Wilson write very conventionally about [unclear]Montood[/unclear]:  The Observer and The Listener was bad, too.  I hope he gets
      fairer reviews than these - tho' I expect its just wha C ex-
      pects.

      Today I am spending at Molly's.  Michael Rinett will be
      there.  Going to read them my play.

      I wish Monday were this side of the weekend and not the far
      side.  I am dying to see you.  I love you so well,

      Adore you
      Lawrence

      Blackheath
      Friday
      Dearest Sylvia
      Thank you for your letters. Let me know what train you are
      coming on and I will meet you. I mention this now as there may
      not be time to confirm it - but I will meet whatever train
      you name.
      I am so glad that you enjoyed the coronation and drank the
      Queen's health. (The Imbers do sound a tense family. I am glad
      that there's less conflict in Frances' family.) You will be
      able to see the Coronation on 3-D, wide screen, technicolor
      films, if you want to, when you come to town.
      Pasmore, the other day, was charming. He chattered about so
      many things beside abstract art! I have never known him get
      off shop before. It was very pleasant.
      John and Magda came 1st yesterday: Frank came after tea (he
      had been at a recording session). Everybody admired again
      Ajax. Magda adored Hetty: John does, too - he had told Magda
      all about it. I borrowed the money from mother and so
      entertained them quite lavishly. I read them the treatment
      of my sound play which they like so all that remains is to
      write it. Probable title: The TRAVEL AGENT.
      The songs I have written already
      won't do. I have to scrap my
      1st draft.
      Angus Wilson wrote very conventionally about [unclear]Monkwood[/unclear] in
      The Observer and The Listener was bad, too. I hope he gets
      fairer reviews than these - tho' I expect its just what C ex-
      pects.
      Today I am spending at Molly's. Michael Rinett will be
      there. Going to read them my play.
      I wish Monday were this side of the weekend and not the far
      side. I am dying to see you. I love you so well,
      adore you
      Lawrence
      P.S.
      I have Mary McCarthy's Groves of Academe.
