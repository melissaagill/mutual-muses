      Wednesday

      Dearest Sylvia,
      I am so sorry not to have written for 2 day, but, until last
      night, I have not had a minute. I have got the Enc. Brit.
      [unclear]painting[/unclear] article off (I enclose a copy) and the Jan. Art News
      article. (I must try to get the Feb. one ready before X'mas.)

      [unclear]Tiny[/unclear] really sounds the [unclear]end[/unclear]. I am so sorry that you have
      to put up with her – but I'm glad C. is nice. Would-
      n't you know that Beryl would get twins! How
      sweet of you to do all that for her. (I will try & write
      to B & George in a say or so.)

      I hope we hear from [unclear]Danvatt[/unclear] soon. I can't wait
      to move in.

      I'm sorry M wants to see you. I hope he only wants to
      talk furniture and nothing else. Where will you see
      him? Why trouble yourself to come to town? I hope
      that it is still alright for me to come down next Tues-
      day the 15th to Hastings. I cannot wait to see
      you.
      Last night – at the ICA – I met a B'heath resident –

      Dearest Sylvia
      I am so sorry not to have written for 2 days, but, until last night, I have not had a minute. I have got the Snc. Brit. painting article off (I enclose a copy) and the Jan. Art News article. (I must try & get the Feb. one ready before x'mas.)
      Tiny really sounds the end. I am so sorry that you have to put up with her - and I'm glad C. is nice. Would u'r you know that Beryl would get twins! How sweet of you to do all that for her. (I will try & write to B & George in a day or so.)
      I hope we hear from Danvatt soon. I can't wait to move in.
      I'm sorry M wants to see you. I hope he only wants to talk forniture and nothing else. Where will you see him? Why trouble yourself to come to town? I hope that it is still alright for me to come down on Tuesday the 15th to [unclear]Hadings[/unclear]. I cannot wait to see you.
