      II

      I hope you enjoyed the 'tongue' sandwiches.  I bought some more Jawolla, dusty & out of breath, arrived just as your bus set off.  When I realised you still had the sandwiches and told him he looked horrified and then set off at a terrible pace after you.  If he caught you up I know he would be charming really and it was an excuse to see you.  Did he find you?...  So I am journeying back alone but - nevermind - Lionel Chat (who is, of course, inevitably a tiger) will be at home, however, with a cup of warm milk.  Have you a picture of a tiger?  I must copy a little bit at first if I am to draw Lionel with due grace.

      Alas, Alas, that the beautiful sauce jug could not be transported this time.  I hope it will not be a trouble to you next time.  I'm so sorry.  I do like it - as I do the table and the secretaire.

      I hope you enjoyed the 'tongue' sandwiches. I bought some more. Jawolla, dusty & out of breath, arrived just as your 'bus set off. When I realised you still had the sandwiches and told him he looked horrified and then set off at a terrible pace after you. If he caught you up I know he would be charming really and it was an excuse to see you. Did he find you?.... So I am journeying back alone but  - never mind - Lionel Chat ( who is, of course, inevitably a tiger) will be at home, [unclear] hovering [/unclear], with a cup of warm milk. Have you a picture of a tiger? I must copy a little bit at first if I am to draw Lionel with due grace.
              Alas, Alas, that the beautiful sauce jug could not be transported this time. I hope it will not be a trouble to you next time. I'm so sorry. I do like it - as I do the table and the secretaire.
