      Dearest Lawrence,

      I hope your lecture on
      Saturday was a great success -
      and that you enjoyed your tea-
      party without getting too tired.
      I wonder why Molly should [unclear]?[/unclear]
      on your having Iris and Andre -
      I shouldn't have thought that they
      were your cup of tea. - I fear Iris -
      she is so sharp - and knows your
      family too well - however I am
      probably over anxious.

      I hope Charles is going to be
      useful it sounds rather promising

      I enjoyed Canterbury exceedingly
      and this time managed to see the
      [unclear]Choir[/unclear], the corona and the crypt.

      I hope you enjoy your social
      evening to-night! I shall be amused
      to hear about it.

      I have no news - but I love
      you dearly, and finish this - haste
      to catch the post.

      My dear Apollo, I love you
      Sylvia

      your tea-<br/>party without getting too tired.<br/>I wonder why Molly should
      ?<br/>on your having Iris and Andre -<br/>I shouldn't have thought that they<br/>were
      your cup of tea. - I fear Iris -<br/>she is so sharp - and knows your<br/>family
      too well - however I am<br/>probably over anxious.<br/><br/>I hope Charles is
      going to be<br/>useful it sounds rather promising<br/><br/>I enjoyed Canterbury
      exceedingly<br/>and this time managed to see the<br/>Choir, the corona and the
      crypt.<br/><br/>I hope you enjoy your social<br/>evening to-night! I shall be
      amused<br/>to hear about it.<br/><br/>I have no news - but I love<br/>you dearly,
      and finish this - haste<br/>to catch the post.<br/><br/>My dear Apollo, I love
      you<br/>Sylvia
