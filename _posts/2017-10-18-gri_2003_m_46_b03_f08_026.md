      NUDE ON A BED
      The nude, upon a double bed,
      Is poised as for a monologue,
      Facing the corner of the room,
      His wrist-watch on, and nothing else:
      Therefore, perhaps we may conclude
      Time is the subject of his thought
      Or, since Time is symbolised
      In the figure, that his thought
      Enjoys a timeless liberty.

      If the watch conditions thoughts
      His are of lovers and their hours,
      The odd and even numbers stand
      For exhaustion and desire,
      Alternate energy and rest
      Quartered on the silver dial:
      Company and absence have
      Their numbered periods and he
      Divides time's plenty with his love's.

      If timeless, then his speculations
      Create abstractions, perfect, warm:
      Pleasure personified by satyrs,
      Water nymphs and laughing lapiths,
      Contemporary and classical,
      Normative of timeless feeling
      Flesh and the flash or orgasm,
      That measures progress by desire
      And not by the grave-digging hand
      Edging deeper round the watch.

      NUDE ON A BED

      The nude, upon a double bed,
      Is poised as for a monologue,
      Facing the corner of the room,
      His wrist-watch, and nothing else:
      Therefore, perhaps we may conclude
      Time is the subject of his thought
      Or, since Time is symbolised
      In the figure, that his thought
      Enjoys a timeless liberty.

      If the watch conditions thoughts
      His are of lovers and their hours,
      The odd and even numbers stand
      For exhaustion and desire,
      Alternate energy and rest
      Quartered on the silver dial :
      Company and absence have
      Their numbered periods and he
      Divides time's plenty with his love's.

      If timeless, then his speculations
      Create abstractions, perfect, warm:
      Pleasure personified by satyrs,
      Water nymphs and laughing lapiths,
      Contemporary and classical,
      Normative of timeless feeling
      Flesh and the flash of orgasm,
      That measures progress by desire
      And not by the grave-digging hand
      Edging deeper round the watch.
