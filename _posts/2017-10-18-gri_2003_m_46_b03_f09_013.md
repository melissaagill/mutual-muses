      Newmarket Station
      19 X 50
      Dearest Sylvia
      Here I am on a large quite empty station waiting for a train to take me to Bury. I am snatching this moment to begin a letter, telling you how much I love you & wondering how your painting progresses. What a good thing about your tenant - I am pleased he is staying. That will lessen possible causes of anxiety. I long for news of your painting but, alas, must contain myself impatiently. Though I once resisted the idea I now delight in it.
      My bed was very hard and I did not sleep very well as a result but I had plenty of rest as I had a bath & retired at nine o'clock. This morning I was able to buy the 2 enclosed cards of details from the choir of the cathedral - very appropriate ones, I think. I rejected all sorts of [unclear]gems[/unclear]scenes, tooth-ache beads, rebases etc before I found the ones I wanted. At least the cathedral is well photographed. There is a Georgian tomb in the Cloister to a gentleman whom all of 'generous mind' who remember as 'eminent from his Superior Abilities in Draining Fenny & Marsh lands'.
      I visited the art class of the College before setting off on my journey this morning to find that the master there insists on solidity & recession from his pupils. I managed to persuade him that perhaps this was not best for the 7 & 8 year olds but the 10-12 boys whom I say this morning where [unclear]busy[/unclear]drawing match boxes in perspective. The master considers Johnson's lectures too factual, adores teh Eng. Water Colour School - in particular De Wint.
