      THE MASQUE OF WATER

      The description of the masque for Sylvia's Birthday, 8th May, 1950

      The Antimasque:

      A Street in London. Enter Lion who dances befpre several shops; he speaks:

      Easy to give her, apples knocked from trees
      That overhang the country lover's path.
      Easy to give her wishes for her health
      And hope that she will never fall in the brook,
      With all her clothes on, even in the Summer.
      What present can I give my Sylvia?

      A Song by Dustjacket:

      Memoirs of Mlle. de Temps,
      A limited edition.
      Giogione's 'Microcosm',
      A complete file of 'transition'?

      A guide book to the chateau
      Where fountains carry fruit;
      The measurements of statues
      On south Italian sites?

      Odes by Forrest, 'How to Swim',
      Dryden's Aeneid, Mrs. Behn,
      'I married the Fisher-King',
      Ripa - hard to obtain.

      Lion:

      I have marked too many anniversaries with volumes, pedantically: why give more books to Minerva when it is from her that authors take their inspiration?

      A Song by Florna:

      The brave hyacinth
      Stands like a hero on a plinth:
      Erect and rounded, see him grow.
      You know that Apollo...

      These imported asphodel
      Are enduring, classical.
      Perfect as a cameo
      With the head of Minervo.

      THE MASQUE OF WATER

      The description of the masque for Sylvia's Birthday, 8th May, 1950

      The Antimasque:

      A Street in London. Enter Lion who dances before several shops; he speaks:

      Easy to give her, apples knocked from trees
      That overhang the country lover's path.
      Easy to give her wishes for her health
      And hope that she will never fall in the brook.
      With all her clothes on, even in the Summer.
      What present can I give my Sylvia?

      A Song by Dustjacket:

      Memoirs of Mlle. de Temps,
      A limited edition.
      Giorgione's 'Microcosm',
      A complete file of 'transition'?

      A guide book to the chateau
      Where fountains carry fruit;
      The measurements of statues
      On south Italian sites?

      Odes by Forrest, 'How to Swim',
      Dryden's Aeneid, Mrs. Behn,
      'I married the Fisher-King',
      Ripa - hard to obtain.

      Lion:

      I have marked too many anniversaries with volumes, ped-
      antically: why give more books to Minerva when it is from her that authors take their inspiration?

      The description of the masque for Sylvia's Birthday, 8th May, 1950

      The Antimasque:
      A Street in London. Enter Lion who dances before several ships; he speaks:
      Easy to giver her applies knocked from trees
      That overhang the country lover's path.Easy to giver her wishes for her health
      And hope that she will never fall in the brook,
      With all her clothes on, even in the Summer.

      A Song by Florna:
      The brave hyacinth
      Stands like a hero on a plinth:
         Erect and rounded, see him grow.
         You know that Apollo ...

      These imported asphodel
      Are enduring, classical.
         Perfect as a cameo
         With the head of Minervo.
