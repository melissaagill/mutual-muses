      Blackheath

      Dearest Sylvia

      Thank you for your letter. I quite understand about Tuesday. I am sorry not to see you tomorrow but I will see you Friday as you say.  I have no objection to looking in at the Art School party: quite the contrary.  I will let you know about trains.  I shall try and find one that gets in about 11:00.

      No I haven't seen your south portrait yet:  if you think you will know I have not had time.  I plan to see it in the new year.

      Thank you for your cuttings from the times which interested me very much (esp. about the Russian Loons).  There are rumours, incidentally, that the cultural set-up in USSR is being 'liberalized': Museum of Modern Art Co open, banned plays to be performed...

      Wolverhampton went well, thank you, and so, it seemed, did my 2 Tate Gallery lectures on Saturday.  (Father came to my [unclear]Lugorlor Frercaes [/unclear]one, incidentally.)

       I am sorry you have not been able to paint but I quite understand the feeling.  Once we are set-

      Dearest Sylvia
      Thank you for your letter. I quite understand about Tuesday. I am sorry not to see you tomorrow but I will see you Friday as you say. I have no objection to looking in at the school party: quite the contrary. I will let you know about trains. I shall try and find one that gets in about 11.00.

      No I haven't seen your south portrait yet: if you think, you will know I have not had time. I plan to see it in the new year.

      Thank you for your cuttings from the times which interested me very much ( esp. about the Russian [unclear]loons[/unclear]) USSR is being 'liberalised': [unclear]music[/unclear] of modern set to open, banned plays to be performed....

      Wolverhampton went well, thank you, and so, it seemed, did my 2 Tate Gallery lectures on Saturday. (Father came to my [unclear]Yugoslav frescoes[/unclear] one, incidentally.)

      I am sorry you have not been able to paint but I quite understand the feeling. Once we are set.
