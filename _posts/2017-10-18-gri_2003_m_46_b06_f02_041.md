      Dearest Sylvia
      Thank you for your labels, stamps, more
      envelopes: in the same delivery came the pri-
      vate view cards - which seem charming to me.
      So we shall not lose time now.
      I am happy to learn you are feeling better
      now - that is good news and it coincides with
      sunny weather here. Last night I slept from
      1.00 until 11.00 - so I feel pleasantly fresh to-
      day, myself.
      Pasmore was very nice last night. He has in-
      vented a new technique using several stages of
      photography and has given me an example. I
      am very pleased as you can imagine. I have placed
      it near your self-portrait SYLVIA (also in pri-
      vate col., Blackheath).
      Thank you for the Birmingham advertisement.
      I gather that you have sent for a form for me.
      Thank you very much indeed. I will fill it
      in promptly on receipt of it, you may be sure.
      When you come on Thursday Pasmore may
      be here as he is coming to coffee that morning.
      I will have all your pictures ready.

      Pasnore was very nice last night. He has invested a new technique using several stages of photography and has given me an example. I am very pleased as you can imagine. I have placed it near your self-portrais SYLVIA (also in portrait col., Blackheath).

      Thank you for the Birmingham advertisement. I gather that you have sent for a form for me. Thank you very much indeed. I will fill it promptly on receipt of it, you may be sure.

      When you come on Thursday Pasnore may be here as he is coming to coffee that morning. I will have all your pictures ready.

      11 '53\n\nDearest Sylvia\n   Thank you for your labels, stamps, more envelopes:
      in the same delivery came the pri-vate view cards - which seem charming to me.
      So we shall not lose time now.\n\n   I am happy to learn you are feeling better
      now - that is good news and it co-incides with sunny weather here. Last night
      I slept from 1.00 until 11.00 - so I feel pleasantly fresh to-day, myself.\n\n
      \  Pasmore was very nice last night. He has in-vented a new technique using
      several stages of photography and has given me an example. I am very pleased
      as you can imagine. I have placed it near your self-portrait SYLVIA (also in
      pri-vate col., Blackheath). \n\n   Thank you for the Birmingham advertisement.
      I gather that you have sent for a form for me. Thank you very much indeed. I
      will fill it in promptly on receipt of it, you may be sure.\n\n   When you come
      on Thursday Pasmore may be here as he is coming to coffee that morning. I will
      have all your pictures ready."
