      remember, [unclear]Eternal[/unclear] series in the Lorenzo exhibition were based. I read it with great interest - though it was less classical in [unclear]feeling[/unclear] than I had hoped. But I will tell you about it when I see you.
      You are constantly in my mind. I love you, dearest. Sleep well & be well, my dove, my darling.
      I love you
