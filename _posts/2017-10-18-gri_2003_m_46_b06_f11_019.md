      Dearest Sylvia
      I adore the scarf. I wouldn't dream of changing it - even for a royal blue one. Thank you so much, dar-
      ling = a charming present at just the right moment.
      I am wearing it now - in the train on the way to the ICA.

      All being well Dannatt will go to [unclear]Oeptow[/unclear] Road today or tomorrow (Wednesday) so we should hear from him very shortly: at any rate, this week. I will [unclear]make[/unclear] or [unclear]?[/unclear] you when he contacts me - as well as sending you full details EXPRESS. I feel very excited about it.

      I have spent all day on the Klee article I took a copy which I will send you when I get a bigger [unclear]?[/unclear] of. I am rather pleased of it now. I was too tired to work well on Sunday but I feel better today.

      I wish you were going to be with me at the ICA tonight. [unclear]Mugda[/unclear] & John are coming & so are the [unclear]?[/unclear]: we would all have had a little party. Soon I hope we will be able to go [unclear]Cogelle[/unclear] to there events.

      I hope you are still sleeping well and are happy. I am: I anticipate the [unclear]Julius[/unclear] so confidently. I love you

      I love you
      Lawrence
