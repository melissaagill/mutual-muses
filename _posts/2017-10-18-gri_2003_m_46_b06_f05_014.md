      I have taken some of the overdue library books back: not Blorke, I shall do that next. I promise.

      I saw Parmore the last evening. He was very friendly. Tell me, does Michael still want work from him? If it is not too late, let me know ( At the moment I look like a fair Parmore because I [unclear]bore val[/unclear] slaved since Friday morning in Bath. Robinson Crusoe Lion.)

      You know how much I admire Allen Tate's poetry. I have a novel by him from the library- The Father. I have not had time to read a word of is, of course, but I look forward to it very much.

      By the way, Maris Prog is supposed to be here working on a book on neo-classicism as a sequel to The Romantic Agony. That will be something.

      I have read other articles in the magazine you sent me and I and I wonder if you would ask what 'ideas of reference' are.

      I love you, my sweetheart. I am so happy that you are painting again. I love love love love you

      I have taken some of the overdue library books back: not Blocher, I shall do that next, I promise.

      I saw Pasmore the other evening. He was very friendly. Tell me, does Michael still want work from him? If it is not too late, let me know. (At the moment I look like a fair Pasmore because I have not shaved since Friday morning in Bath. Robinson Crusoe-lion.)

      You know how much I admire Allen Tate's poetry. I have a novel by him from the library - The Fathers. I have not had time to read a word of it, of course, but I look forward to it very much.

      By the way, Mario Praz is supposed to be working on a book on neo-classicism as a sequel to The Romantic Agency. That will be something.

      I have read other articles in the magazine you sent me and I wonder if you would ask Clifford what 'ideas of reference' are.

      I love you, my sweetheart. I am so happy that you are painting again. I love love love love you.
      adore you
      Lawrence
