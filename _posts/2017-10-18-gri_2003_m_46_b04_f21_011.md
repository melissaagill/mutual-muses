      2.  this evening M. and I are going
      to coffee with the Savages!  We
      were having them to dinner but
      they can't get a sitter!
      I hope your Blake lecture went
      well--and that you had a good
      audience--also that you were
      able to go to the Bioscope with
      your parents.  We saw 'Top Hat' at
      Brixton--don't you remember the
      Waterloo Church?
      I long to see Apollo on the Arch
      and so glad that Parsons is so grand
      as a reference!
      I wonder if you are passing the
      Redfern if you could possibly collect
      my pictures.  They are Greenwich
      Observatory and the Geranium on
      the Dining Room Window Sill.  They
      are unframed so not very uncomfort-
      able.  I enclose one of the two
      cards they have sent to me.

      We were having them to dinner but they can't get a sitter! <br/>I hope your
      Blake lecture went well - and that you had a good audience. - also that you
      were able to go to the Bioscope with your parents - we saw "Top Hat" at Brixton
      - don't you remember the Waterloo church? <br/>I long to see Apollo on the Arch.
      and so glad that Parson is so grand as a referee! <br/>I wonder if you are passing
