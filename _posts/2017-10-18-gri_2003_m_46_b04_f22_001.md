          Thank you for your charming letter
      I am delighted that Magda likes me
      and I shall very much look forward
      to an evening spent with her, and
      you and John.  I am also delight-
      ed to hear of  John's good fortune in
      having her patronage and I do hope
      he has a show in the near future.
         I am glad Paul will see my new
      pictures -- I am longing to see his.
         Thank you for the dates.  I gather
      at it would be best if I came after
      the 13th.  I am very glad you have
      some lectures coming along.
         I don't know when I can come
      at the moment as Michael is going
      to Cambridge at the end of the
      month, and Marjorie is still away
      I may hear to-morrow when to
      expect her back.  Much as I
      long to see you I don't think I
      should come at present as I

      Derest Lawrence  Thank you for your charming letter.  I am delighted that Magda likes me and I shall very much look forward to an evening spent with her, and you and John.  I am also delighted tohear of John's good fortune in having her patronage and I do hope he has a show in the near future.  I am glad Paul will see my new pictures - I am longing to see his.  Thank you for the dates.  I gather at it would be best if I came after the 13th.  I am very glad you have some lectures coming along.  I don't know when I can come at the moment as Michael is going to Cambridge at the end of he month, and Marjorie is still away  I may hear to-orrow when to expect her book.  Much as I long to see you I don't think I should come at present as I don't think Ishould leave Michael
