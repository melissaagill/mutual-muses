      today, that he had already sat to you for his portrait.  When I opened the letter
      he fluttered impatiently:  'Well', he said, 'Recognise who it is?'  I did, instantly.

      tried to book for the ballet yesterday but now they are ending on the 25th.
      \ I am so sorry- I should have known earlier.  Will you let me now at Bath what
      you would like to see instead and I'll book as soon as I return.  What about

      17th September 1948

      Dearest Sylvia,

      What a charming and feeling greeting you sent and what pleasure it gave Dandylion. He is wearing a new blue bow this morning and your letter has made him very happy. The White Owl kept his secret well and did not tell me, until today, that he had already sat to your for his portrait. When I opened the letter he fluttered impatiently: 'Well', he said, 'Recognise who it is?' I did instantly. And what a dear, voluptuous rose. Darling Sylvia, thank you.

      I tried to book for the ballet yesterday but now they are ending on the 25th. I am so sorry - I should have known earlier. Will you let me know at Bath what you would like to see instead and I'll book as soon as I return. What about Eileen Herlie's Medea. Do tell me.

      I wish I had more time in this letter but soon I must go to London with Mother. In my new bow. And that reminds me: are you intending to lengthen your dress with the Italian material for your visit here? I think I shall send the Tawny Owl to find out if he can be-cause you hinted at this, I thought, in a letter.

      Here is a small section for Sylvia the Painter and Sylvia the Critic. I hope you're instructed or di-verted by it; Agostino Carracci's sonnet to Niccolo dell'Abate.

      Whoever a goodly painter seeks to be
      Should take the Romans' drawing to his aid,
      Movement from the Venetians, and their shade,
      And worthy coloring from Lombardy.

      The awesome Michelangelo must see
      The truth to nature Titian has displayed,
      The pure and sovereign style Correggio had,
      And of a Raphael just symmetry.

      Tibaldi's basis, and his decoration,
      Invention of learned Primaticcio's own,
      And just a little grace from Parmigianino.

      But leaving so much study and vexation
