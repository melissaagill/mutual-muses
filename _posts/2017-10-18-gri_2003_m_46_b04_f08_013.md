      It is 10.00 o'clock in the morning. Having one of your nice leisured breakfasts
      surrounded by old comics, or have you by now gone into the kitchen to talk with
      Tiny? I met William Turnbull the sculptor yesterday at the ICA he seems, though
      cleverer than most, to have the same obscure subjective notions about painting
      so boringly popular among practitioners of this manual art. What a brilliant
      example are you by contrast-paragon of a sensual & coherent aesthetic. Dearest
      Sylvia, how I love you-my treasure, my muse, my caught painter in whose canvases
      I am myself court. I love you  Lawrence

    clean_transcription: I miss you very much.  What I wonder<br/>are you doing at
      present?  It is 10:00<br/>o'clock in the morning.  Having one of your<br/>nice
      leisured breakfasts surrounded by<br/>old comics, or have you by now gone with<br/>the
      litela to talk with Tiny?<br/>I met William Turnbull the sculptor<br/>yesterday
      at the ICA.  He seems, though cleverer<br/>than most, to have the same obscure<br/>subjective
      notions about painting so<br/>boringly popular among practitioners at<br/>their
      manual art.  What a brilliant<br/>example are you by contrast--papra-<br/>gon
      of a sensual and coherent aesthet-<br/>ic.<br/>Dearest Sylvia, how I love you--<br/>my
      treasure, my muse, my caught<br/>painter in unlose canvases I am myself<br/>court.<br/>I
      love you<br/>Lawrence
