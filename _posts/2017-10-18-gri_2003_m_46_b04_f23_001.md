      1.11.51

      Dearest Lawrence

      I am writing this while waiting to go to Savage's Lecture- noblesse oblige you know! I shall fill in the form as far as I can, that is to say we had arranged to have "The Begonias" "Yon and Paul" and "Still Life with Mermaid" aleady if possible you may think of a landscape which I have forgotten, (not [unclear]Nazareth or Dornay[/unclear] be able to bring the [unclear]Pett[/unclear]! If not send the three- or what about "Bacchus."

      I shall be glad to see you. I feel so nervous and vague. I keep breaking things- two well-loved things of my own!

      I am still not quite sure if it wll be Monday or not. I will wire Jon- it may be Sunday- that will simplify matters. Tiny is coming on Friday- that will be nice.

      I have a "new" suitcase from rummage with a decent handle and Mrs Wake has given me some jumpers and a fur. I had such a delightful tea with her.

      I expect to come on Sunday-
      I love you.  I adore you. Sylvia.
