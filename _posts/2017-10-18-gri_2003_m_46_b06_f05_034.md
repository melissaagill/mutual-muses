      KING: You wonder how the tax is spent.
      You've no right to grumble - or wink,
      It doesn't go on the Queen's new mink.
      We're using it for defence.

      We have secret weapons, a tent
      That keeps out the elements.
      New armor without a chink.
      A galley nothing can sink.
      For messages, invisible ink.

      I could tell you more but you must excuse me
      For reasons of national security.

      The camera pans to scientists at work in the laboratory in the palace. Weird machines and jerky movements. The people have a sight of this, are inspired, and go off in a military step. The King relaxes. Messenger enters. King takes the message languidly; reads it; jumps to his feet; collapses, and groans;

      This means war.

      GRAND BALLET: recruiting; tests of weapons; machines of war; maps, &c.
      Then scenes of the war itself.

      KING: You wonder how the tax is spent.
      You've no right to grumble - or wink.
      It doesn't go on the Queen's new mink.
      We're using it for defense.

      We have secret weapons, a tent
      That keeps out the elements.
      New armor without a chink.
      A galley nothing can sink.
      For messages, invisible ink.

      I could tell you more but you must excuse me
      For reasons of national security.

      The camera pans to scientists at work in the laboratory
      in the palace. Weird machines and jerky movements.
      The people have a sight of this, are inspired, and go
      off in a military step. The King relaxes. Messenger
      enters. king takes the message languidly; reads it;
      jumps to his feet; collapses, and groans:

      This means war...

      GRAND BALLET: recruiting; tests of weapons; machines
      of war; maps, &c.
      Then scenes of the war itself.
