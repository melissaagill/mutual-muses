      Dearest Lawrence,
      A note to say that I shall be
      coming by the afternoon 'bus (coach!)
      on Friday as arranged. I hope
      your lecture on the P.R's went
      well - I so much look forward to hearing all your news. I
      am not keen on parties as you
      know but I will come, if we
      may, please, not stay too late!
      I must put this in the door
      now to catch the post.
      I love you
      Sylvia
