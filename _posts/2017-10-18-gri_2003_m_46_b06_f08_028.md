      I was at the ICA this morning. I had a
      talk with Paulozzi about an exhibit-
      ion of photographs he has made which sounds
      interesting: radio valves, geology,
      leaves, nodmen's drawings, &c. It will be held at the ICA next month.
      Also we got together on science-fic-
      tion films. He liked War of the Worlds
      very much.

      Really this letter is mainly to send
      my love. I have no news. Nearly
      time for my Rodin lecture.
      I adore you
      Lawrence
