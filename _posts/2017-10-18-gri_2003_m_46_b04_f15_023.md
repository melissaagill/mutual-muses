      Pett 22.3.51
      Dearest Lawrence,
      I feel extra-ordinarily depressed and angst-ridden - I could weep. So that my re-actions to your letter are not those that I should ordinarily have - Your poem is [unclear]charming[/unclear] - and so is Pauls [unclear]drawing[/unclear] but I very much resent his being enclosed with yours - as if you were having a homosexual affair through me - no doubt this is quite unreasonable but it makes me feel ungracious towards your double effort. However thank Paul very much and say that I think it most elegant. I hope you are not infected by Paul's irresponsibility - for I'm sorry you did not go to Banstead.

      Clifford seems to have all his books - When do you want the article - he will send it tomorrow I think.

    clean_transcription: Pett 22.3.51<br/>Dearest Lawrence,<br/>I feel extra-ordinarily
      depressed and angst-ridden - I could weep. So that my re-actions to your letter
      are not those that I should ordinarily have - Your poem is charming - and so
      is Paul's drawing but I very much resent his being enclosed with yours - as
      if you were having a homosexual affair through me - no doubt this is quite unreasonable
      but it makes me feel ungracious towards your double effort. However thank Paul
      very much and say that I think it is most elegant. I hope you are not infected
      by Paul's irresponsibility - for I'm sorry you did not go to Banstead.<br/>Clifford
      seems to have all his books - when do you want the article - he will send it
      tomorrow I think.
