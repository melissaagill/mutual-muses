      Pett

      Dearest Lawrence,
      I missed you so much too, and
      only consoled myself by imagining
      your doings, after you had gone I
      had a little chat with the Woods
      and moaned a bit over your depart-
      ure, then went and prepared the
      mason dump--being called in by
      Clifford later for some tea which
      cheered me up.  After which I tidied
      up and went to bed with Ruskin!
      Yesterday I did the washing and
      arrived "on the motif" about 10.45
      but it was rather cloudy with only
      bursts of bright sunshine so that
      I painted in the oak tree and lighten-
      ed the vista.  I am just off again
      and hope to finish the foreground
      this morning.  As I came to the
      spot I felt a great pang and
      wished so much you were there

      Dearest Lawrence,
      I missed you so much too - and
      only consoled myself by imagining
      your doings - after you had gone I
      had a little chat with the Woods
      and mourned a bit over your depart-
      ure - then went and prepared the
      marrow dump - being called in by
      Clifford later for some tea which
      cheered me up. After which I tidied
      up and went to bed with Ruskin!
      Yesterday I did the washing and
      arrived "on the [unclear]mot[/unclear]" about 10.45
      but it was rather cloudy with only
      bursts of bright sunshine so that
      I painted in the oak-tree and lighten-
      ed the Viola - I am just off again
      and hope furnish the foreground
      this morning. As I came to the
      spot I felt a great bang and
      wished so much you were there

    clean_transcription: Pett 12.5.52<br/><br/>Dearest Lawrence,<br/>I missed you
      so much too - and<br/>only consoled myself by imagining<br/>your doings - after
      you had gone I<br/>had a little chat with the Woods<br/>and mourned a bit over
      your depart-<br/>ure - then went and prepared the<br/>marrow dump - being called
      in by<br/>Clifford later for some tea which<br/>cheered me up. After which I
      tidied<br/>up and went to bed with Ruskin!<br/>Yesterday I did the washing and<br/>arrived
      "on the mot" about 10.45<br/>but it was rather cloudy with only<br/>bursts of
      bright sunshine so that<br/>I painted in the oak-tree and lighten-<br/>ed the
      Viola - I am just off again<br/>and hope furnish the foreground<br/>this morning.
      As I came to the<br/>spot I felt a great bang and<br/>wished so much you were
      there
