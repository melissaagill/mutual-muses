      Monday
      Dearest Sylvia
      This morning I bought margarine for Tiny and in a day or two I will get some nice cheese to bring with me: nor will I forget to bring an emergency card for meat.
      I am in town - having a cup of coffee (it is 9:40) before going to SEA office for a morning's work.  Then, after lunch, I have to go to the V and A and collect the slides for about 6 (yes it is exactly 6) lectures. Then this evening, at home, I shall write out some of my [unclear][/unclear] notes.
      Yesterday afternoon I went to the TS to get my Degas lecture ready.  it is really a poor exhibition (containing 3 or 4 good works only): what is not already familiar is not worth knowing.  There are only too many pictures that have been going round the dealers for what can only be described as years.  (There were queues to get in, however.)
      The correction you suggest in the poem 'and of fate' is how I wrote the line originally: but the second 'of' is padding and omitting it gives fate extra weight.  One stresses it in reading to balance the line.  At least - that is the idea.....
      Your painting news is excellent.  Congratulations on completing 'Cliff End.'  I am glad that it will help you to finish R&A, also.
      Hurrah for Tiny!  How did she 'come by' the material she has given you?  It sounds charming

      Dearest Sylvia
      This morning I bought margarine for Tiny and in a day or two I will get some nice cheese to bring with me: nor will I forget to bring an emergency card for meat.
      I am in town - having a cup of coffee (it is 9.40) before going to SEA office for a morning's work. Then, after lunch, I have to go to the V and A and collect the slides for about 6 (yes it is exactly 6) lectures. Then this evening, at home, I shall write out some of my sex notes.
       Yesterday afternoon I went to the TG to get  my Degas lecture ready. It is really a poor exhibition (containing 3 or 4 good works only): what is  not already familiar is not worth knowing. There are only too any pictures that have been going  round the dealers for what can only be described as years. (There were queues to get in, however.)
      The correction you suggest in the poem 'and of fate' is how I wrote the line originally: but the second 'of' gives padding and omitting it gives fate extra weight. One stresses it in reading to balance the line. At least - that is the idea .....
      Your painting news is excellent. Congratulations on completing 'Cliff End'. I am glad that it will help you to finish R&A also.
      Hurrah for Tiny! How did she 'come by' the material she has given you? It sounds charming.
