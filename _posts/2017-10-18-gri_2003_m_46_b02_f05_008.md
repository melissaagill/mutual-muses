      Stain the Goddess' hands and arms.
      Pillowed in roses all the fruit
      Pulses, growing still, though picked
      For you on whom this anniversary
      Is centred like a wheel of stars.

      A wave holds its crystal form
      Like the coiffure of a belle
      Then breaks into a million glasses:
      Blue bearded Neptune gives
      A coral-sculptured ship which can
      Float balanced on a tear,
      Or ride the ocean's forked storms,
      Navigate serpentine rivers
      From font to estuary,
      Or sink in the circle of a wishing well.

      The gift of fire was Love's:
      Flames to burn the crumbling
      Tapestry of the past.
      Fire is a metaphor
      Of the creative flow of blood,
      Of the badges of the lips,
      Of the rubies on your breasts.
      Such images surmount
      The locket in my hand
      With its burning periphery
      As I loll beside the stream.

      (3)

      Is Time among your visitors?
      He is, but nude, unbearded,
      Not as the insane destroyer
      Hungry to subtract desire
      From the total of your years -
      He is this nude, unbearded
      Boy who waits for you
      On your birthday for this year -
      Agile Opportunity.

      Time would add a gift
      To the elemental four
      And he dedicates to you
      A Summer fraught with double roses.
