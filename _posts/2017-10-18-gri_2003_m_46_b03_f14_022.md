      Dearest Lawrence, I wonder what exciting adventures you have been having, and if you have been to Fountainbleau yet.
      The weather here has been very windy and changeable and I have not yet been able to work on the view near the church ([unclear][/unclear] view). It seems, at the moment, calmer this morning so I am in hopes that I may be able to work on it before lunch. Yesterday M. took me up to the "White [unclear][/unclear]" and I started on my large picture. The weather was rough and changeable but I managed to work on the sky and put in the bay.  We shall go up there this afternoon if the weather isn't too bad, and this time M. thinks he will do a drawing too. Though not from my point of
