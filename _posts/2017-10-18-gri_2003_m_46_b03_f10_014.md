    annotation_text: Clacton 14 x1 50 Dearest Sylvia, When travelling like this I
      alternately wish you were here & then, in a sense, am glad that you are spared
      so many cold bed-rooms, profitless encounters, time spent in stations, &c. The
      audience last night was fabulously vieux, quite unable to follow my most elementary
      points, though I repeated them in a sickening manner, but happy I think in their
      sluggish fashion, even with me.  I have a small bag this time (Paul's) and Proust,
      Swann-Love II.  I have read 80 pp. in train & in bed.  At first delicious comedy
      & now the most disturbing account of the stupid Swann's tortures.  So close
      are Swann's sensations to myself I feel quite agitated - confirming my fear
      of novels for psychological as well as aesthetic reasons.  However, I am unable
      to put the book down.  But, really, can I not argue, in desperate defense, that
      aesthetic distance is lacking?  At  any rate I'm harrowed, & in great suspense.   I
      enclose a [unclear] [/unclear]for you & the [unclear][/unclear] to make up for
      the rather gloomy Derealised Island.  I am writing this in a library, goggled
      at by excruciatingly tidy librarians.  I feel like throwing the geographical
      magazine at them - or at least expectorating.  Clacton is a bore.  I don't mind
      lecturing but I'm sick of the time wasted in travelling from place to place
      so I can only write fragmentarily, &c. Well I think I'll have a 'look at the
      front' while I'm here.  Sorry if this is a disgruntled letter but it is so tiresome
      a contrast this lecturing compared to my peaceful Sunday writing ....it seems
      ages ago.  Darling Sylvia I love you, I adore you Lawrence

      like this I alternately wish you were here & then, in a<br/>sense, am glad that
      you are spared so many cold bed - rooms, profit-<br/>less encounters, time spent
      in stations, &c.  The audience last<br/>night was fabulously nieuse . quite
      unable to follow my most ele-<br/>mentary points.  though I repeated them in
      sickening manner, but<br/>happy I think in their sluggish fashion, even with
      me.<br/>   I have a small bag this time (Paul's) and Proust, Swann in Love II.<br/>I
      have read 80 pp. in train & in bed.  st just delicious comedy & vow<br/>is most
      disturbing account of the stupid Swann's tortures. So close<br/>are Swann's
      sensations to myself I feel quite agitated - confirming<br/>my fear of novels
      for psychological as well as aesthetic reasons.<br/>However, I am unable to
      put the book down. But, really, can I<br/>not argue, in desperate defense, that
      aesthetic distance is lack -<br/>ing?  At any rate I'm burrowed, In in great
      suspense.<br/>  I enclose a poem for you & the owls in wake up the rather<br/>Gloomy
      Derealised I stand.<br/>   I am writing this in a library, goggled at by excruciatingly
      <br/>tidy librarians.  I feel like throwing the Geographical Magazine<br/>at
      them - or at least expectorating - Clation is a bore.<br/> I don't mind lecturing
      but I'm sick of the time wasted in trav-<br/>elling from place to place so I
      can only write fragmentanl, &c.<br/>   Well I think I'll have a 'look at the
