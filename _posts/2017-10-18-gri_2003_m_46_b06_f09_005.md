       and my Adrian Heath review.
      By the way did I tell you that Rathenstein said that he liked my [unclear]simpel fils[/unclear] review in Art News & was charming also, about the lectures?
      You have had a lot of jobs to do. I hope that you can paint regularly soon again and I am terribly glad that your resurrection study of C is going so well.
      Frank hasn't written music for Travel Agent as he was too tired on his holiday. It will be written only the next few weeks probably. Magda will see that it is. One day in the next week Frank & I are going to work at a popular programme for the BBC. I am to write the scripts - [unclear]$[/unclear]15 on so a time.
      I don't know if John is doing jewellry at present. But I will ask him.

      Dearest Sylvia
      Thank you for your letters and thank you, too, for the [unclear]â¤[/unclear]1. That enabled me to buy food yesterday so I can stay at home today & work. Otherwise I would have had to go to Wimbledon to eat and I can't do much work there. I am getting ready my Blake lecture (including [unclear]Antul[/unclear] as you suggested) and my Adrian Heath review.
      By the way did I tell you that Rottenstein saithat he liked my [unclear]Gimpst[/unclear] fils review in Art News & was charming also, about my lectures?
      You have had a lot of jobs to do. I hope that you can paint regularly soon again and I am terribly glad that you resurrection study of C is going so well.
      Frank hasn't written music for Travel Agent as he was too tired on his holiday. It will be written only the next few weeks probably. [unclear]Moyda[/unclear] will see that it is. One day in the next week Frank & I are going to work out a popular programme for the BBC. I am to write scripts $15 or so at a time.
      I don't know if John is doing jewellry at present. But I will ask him.
      Paul [unclear]Skewell's[/unclear] sonnets don't sound as if they are lion's fare but I am interested to hear of your favorable opinion of them. You mention the last 4 lines as his work
