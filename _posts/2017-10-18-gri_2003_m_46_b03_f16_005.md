      Dearest Lawrence,
      Thank you for your card - I am most
      delighted with your news. How very
      kind of your father. Now you can feel
      gay and unworried again, my darling.
      Do tell me about your lectures when
      you have time. I am very pleased and
      excited to hear about the poem. Dearest
      Lawrence, my Sun, Apollo.
      I have very little news. I have rather
      pottered to-day - doing some washing and
      ironing, washing my hair and talking
      to Tiny. This afternoon I worked hard at
      the "Savage" picture - doing something of
      the child but working mainly on the
      kitten which I think is good. I shall
      work on the background and some of the
      child at home. I shall work in it
      again next week - after that Frankie
      goes to school. To-morrow morning I
      shall if it is not windy, work at
      the church - for the weather never seems
