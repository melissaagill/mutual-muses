      Pett

      Dearest Lawrence,
      I feel rather tired and uncreative to-day - I long to see you - I dreamt I was dancing with Hetty this morning - I adored her- her hair was quite covered with copper beech leaves like a cloche hat - and her eyes were very large and dark we were dancing in a large garden with a high wall along the top of which were [unclear]massive[/unclear] beech branches as if they grew out of the top of the wall. It was like a large neglected tennis court.
      I hope you arrived home safely and are not too tired - I long for a letter. Which is quite unreasonable as I have had so many.
      The Kensington Gallery have already sent me private view cards!
      John has been very ill, and is still rather bad.
      Tiny has been most kind and helpful.

      Hatly this morning - I adored her. Les Laine was quite covered with copper beach
      leaves like a closh hat - and her eyes were very large and dark we were dancing
      in a large garden with a high wall along the top of which were massed beach
      branches as if they grew out of the top of the wall - it was like a large neglected
      tennis court.<br/>I hope you arrived home safely and are not too tired - I long
      for a letter. Which is quite unreasonable as I have had so many.<br/>The Kensington
      Gallery have already sent me private view cards.<br/>John has been very ill,
      and is still rather bad.<br/>Triny has been most kind and helpful
