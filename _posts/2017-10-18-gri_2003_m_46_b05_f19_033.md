      Blackheath yet?

      Thank you for the charming poem - I feel quite "home sick"! and for the picture of Dandy - I'm sorry he is [unclear]pealing[/unclear]. I hope you are no longer sore. I'm so glad that you enjoyed Pett. I hope you can come again with M. Chase in September I had better make the necessary arrangements when I aim in town. What about asking Sylvester too! It would be a bold stroke! I don't suppose you would approve of that; but if he were interested enough to come it might help to create interest in my [unclear]mosk[/unclear] beforehand. I will discuss it when I see you. We are all looking forward to your lecture on the 25th.

      I must go and work now!

    clean_transcription: Blackheath yet? <br/><br/>Thank you for the charming poem
      - <br/>I feel quite "home sick"! and for<br/>the picture of Dandy - I'm sorry<br/>he
      is pealing. I hope you are <br/>no longer sore. I'm so glad that <br/>you enjoyed
      Pett. I hope you<br/>can come again with M-Chase in <br/>September I had better
      make the <br/>necessary arrangements when I <br/>am in town. What about asking<br/>Sylvester
      too! It would be a <br/>bold stroke! I don't suppose <br/>you would approve
      of that, but<br/>if he were interested enough<br/>to come it might help to create<br/>interest
      in my work before hand.<br/>I will discuss it when I see you. <br/>We are all
      looking forward to<br/>your lecture on the 25th.<br/><br/>I must go and work
      now!
