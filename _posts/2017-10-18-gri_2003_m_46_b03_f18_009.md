      Pett 14.11.50
      Dearest lawrence,
      I notice by the date that it is the Private View day at the Kensington - I hope it goes well - I wish I had some luck!
      I was so happy to have both your letters - pleased that you had the money in time, sorry that I had not stayed - anyway very pleased that you could eat properly and not worry.
      I am delighted by your poem now - it seems to me very good there is perhaps one small point - so slight that I would rather dis-cuss it with you than write it! For I think the poem so very good. The essay I have only had time to read once - but it seems excell-ent - M has also and very much admires it - he says you

      the<br/>Kensingtion - I hope it goes well -<br/>I wish I had some luck!<br/>    I
      was so happy to have<br/>both your letters - please that<br/>you had the money
      in time,<br/>sorry that I had not stayed -<br/>anyway very pleased that you<br/>could
      eat properly and not worry.<br/>    I am delighted by your poem<br/>now - it
      seems to me very good<br/>there is perhaps one small point -<br/>so slight that
      I would rather dis-<br/>cus it with you than write it!<br/>Yes I think the poem
      so very good.<br/>The essay I have only had time <br/>to read once - but it
      seems excell-<br/>ent - m. has also and very<br/>much admires it - he says you
