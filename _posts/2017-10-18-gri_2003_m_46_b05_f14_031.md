      Dearest Lawrence,
      Thank you for your darling letters with poems and drawings - what wonderful paper - my! You do get about!
      I had wished to write to you yesterday but I had such a streaming cold that I thought the germs might travel.  It is not quite so damp to-day, but not much better.  I felt quite well otherwise, though rather less energetic than usual.  I had hoped to improve my condition by being in the sun and air on Wednesday so I put in the rest of the beans and pruned the roses.  In the morning I cleaned the dining-room, yesterday I cleaned the spare room and to-day the sitting-room so that there is only the studio which badly needs attention - my room - as I am not using it, can wait.  Yesterday I did do some painting in the afternoon - the sky and trees out of the window - it is going [unclear][/unclear]

      Dearest Lawrence,
      Thank you for your darling letters with poems and drawings - what wonderful paper. my! you do get about!
      I had wished to write to you yesterday but I had such a scream - my cold that I thought the germs might travel. it is not quite so damp to-day. but not much better. I feel quite well, otherwise, though rather less energetic than usual. I had hoped to improve my condition by being in the sun and air on Wednesday so I put in the rest of the beans and pruned the roses. In the morning I cleaned the dining room and to-day the sitting-room So that there is only the studio which badly needs attention. my room - as I am not using it, can wait. Yesterday I did do some painting in the afternoon - the sky and trees out of the window - it is going nicely
