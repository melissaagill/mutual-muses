      Dearest Sylvia
      I do hope that your journey yesterday was
      supportable, despite the disgracefully sub-
      human fellow passengers inflicted upon you.
      I glimpsed you again after leaving the
      'bus station, as the coach crossed the road
      at the traffic lights.  You seemed to be hold-
      ing the envelope as tho' taking lion-poetry
      out of it.
      I rang my parents yesterday so am going to
      have high tea at Wimbledon and then go on to
      [unclear]Banstead[/unclear].  First I shall have lunch with
      [unclear]wally[/unclear] and Eric.  I have 21 excellent slides -
      including 4 [unclear]Emit[/unclear] and 4 [unclear]Niro[/unclear].  I do mind that
      you were to be there this evening.
      Your melting moments last night were
      so delicious - just what appetite and senti-
      ment needed.  I cannot tell you  what time
      I went to bed, not having a watch, but I
      do not THINK it was late ...
      Mrs [unclear]Haverson[/unclear] is going to make a start on
      our covers herself.  I hesitated but she as-
      sures me she is expert
