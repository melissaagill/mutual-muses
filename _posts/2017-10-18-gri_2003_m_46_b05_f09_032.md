      (II)
      The PAST
      Who wants in? The perfect place
      Is ship-shape, if you care:
      Not a game without the score -
      Fittest of anywhere for praise,
      Unin habited, divine.

      Who lived in? Someone that roamed
      Via the grave urns and ghost
      Towns off the map, long lost
      Except as symbols of my home -
      Out at the count of nine.

      The valuables that I saved
      From the place so like a mint
      Have an album grandeur - tints
      Added by hand to a world engraved
      On travels not mine.

      Words are easy for a monument -
      The past being chosen,
      The statues frozen.
      But how shall I form the present
      Into a certain sign?
