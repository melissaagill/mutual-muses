      Edmund Wilson reviewed a new book by  Gilbert Seldes in The New
      Yorker (28. x. 1950). Seldes in 1924 published The Seven Lively
      Arts: his new book is The Great Audience, an extension of his
      earlier study, more sociological, more conscience-striken.
      Wilson writes: 'He shows that the contemporary world of the
      films is one in which men and women are never allowed to have
      sexual relations'. This is a half-truth only. What is left
      out of it is that although genital relationships may be rare in
      narrative terms, sexual interests are constantly aroused on the
      screen. The genital relationship is often implicit
      as the motive for action or in the development of a situation which
      the camera does not follow through. Full appreciation of movie
      sex depends on a knowledge of publicity and of interest in the
      stars themselves, of course. Then the sexual undercurrents may
      be easily felt - provided you are disposed to its fashionable form.
      In a magazine of a type from which many people might hesitate
      to quote (Beauty Parade), six Holywood lovelies were quizzed con-
      cerning beefcake. To quote the caption written: 'Standard cos-
      tume for beefcake is trunks. The whole physique must show '(my
      italics). Shelley Winters is quoted: 'Let's have more of it'
      Esther Williams is more guarded because her publicity has always
      stressed her fit-for-the-family status in the M.G.M. pantheon:
      'I like to see it when done in good taste'. The tricky problem
      of discriminating tasteful from offensive beefcake must wait on
      another occasion. Ava Gardner thinks 'it's sensational' but adds
      'Girls like men's minds'. Virginia Mayo is enigmatic: 'beefcake

      Edmund Wilson reviewed a new book by Gilbert Seldes in the New Yorker (28. x. 1950). Seldes in 1924 published The Seven Lively Arts: his new book is The Great Audience, an extension of his earlier study, more sociological, more conscience-stricken. Wilson writes: 'He shows that the contemporary world of the films is one in which men and women are never allowed to have sexual relations'. This is a half-truth only. What is left out of it is that although genital relationships may be rare in narrative terms, sexual interests are constantly aroused on the screen. The genital relationship is often implicit as the motive for action or in the development of a situation which the camera does not follow through. Full appreciation of movie sex depends on a knowledge of publicity and an interest in the stars themselves, of course. Then the sexual undercurrents may be easily felt - provided you are disposed to its fashionable form.
      In a magazine of a type from which many people might hesitate to quote (Beauty Parade), six Hollywood lovlies were quizzed concerning beekcake. To quote the caption writer: 'Standard costume for beekcake is trunks. The whole physique must show' (my italics). Shelley Winters is quoted: 'Let;s have more of it'. Esther Williams is more guarded because her publicity has always stressed her fit-for-the-family status in the M.G.M. panteon: 'I like to see it when done in good taste'. The tricky problem of discriminating tasteful from offensive beekcake must wait on another occasion. Ava Gardner thinks 'it's sensational' but adds 'Girls like men's minds'.
