      [unclear][/unclear]Blackheath
      4/11/1952

      Dearest Sylvia
      I look forward to meeting you on Thursday morning. I will check myself the time of your bus' arrival at Lewisham.
      I had not repressed the fact you were visiting M. What you had repressed from me however is the fact it was a week-end. I thought it was simply for a day.
      About seeing the Greenwoods; 3 will not support us very long. Here are some dates. You arrive on 6th. We have the 7th together, then you go to Cambridge. I don't know when you will be back but anyway by Monday 10th for Clifford's lecture. Tuesday 11th I have a Tate lecture at 3.00 and a Petersfield lecture at 7.30. I believe I must stay the night. Banstead on Wednesday 12th. Perhaps you can come back on Sunday night which would give us more time because you might (unless a cheque comes) have to go about Tuesday 11th. [unclear]Seaved[/unclear] you say that provisionally...
      Zadkine's sculptures [unclear]tho'[/unclear]interesting attractive are [unclear]not[/unclear] I think first-rate. He is so clever with chiaroscuro that his concavities really look like the 'real thing' sometimes. His lecture was a bit [unclear][/unclear] and somewhat elevated but it contained some exciting bits and he is a bubbling, eloquent little man (tiny) who sweeps one along with him, at least [unclear]partially[/unclear]. I saw several other exhibitions yesterday too but nothing worth recording.
      The war film article is not finished yet but next weekend I shall complete it. The I.C.A. are showing le Sang d'un poet at the end of the month. If possible you must be here and we shall see it together.
      Love you Lawrence
