      room on the German pictures from Muril before going to see leovor Finds' ballet with Paul this evening.
         I wish that I had been in a position to celebrate your birthday with you [unclear][/unclear] recent indignantly being forced to content myself with written wishes.
             I am glad you are looking through your Italian [unclear]wardrobe[/unclear] - if there is anything  you need we can buy it.  I am going to buy a shirt and socks this week.  The directions of Moddens are reading [unclear]Mogoits[/unclear] at the monment.  Cults seems to like it -  he is guarded, but he waved [unclear]ar[/unclear] home given it to his directions if he felt  it was not what he wanted.  So I hope to [unclear]peas[/unclear] soon and I hope for good news.
         Sylvia - I love you - and though you say in your letter you have no news - the words in which you [unclear][/unclear] [unclear][/unclear] love delight me, and is the best possible news.
                  I love you Lawrence
