      His name is Peter Bird and I have hi telephone number &, if I get a minute,
      intend to get in touch with him before the N G interviews in October. The girl
      who accompanied us back has just had a couple of years in Germany: on reference
      to my query about new German parties she named (and, I quote) Frau Mare A Kokoschia.
      I have not idea why she failed.<br/>Your letter "painted" a charming picture
      of your working with Tiny in the articles: it was a delightfully written piece
      which I so much enjoyed. Speaking of writing I am working on some new poems
      after a quite long silence: I don''t know what they''re about yet. I will send
      them when I have them ready. This renewed poetic impulse is the reason that
      I am now rereading the Italian poem- you need to feel creative even to revise
      successfully. <br/>Do not worry, dearest cat, I will soon have a job. <br/>I
      love you<br/>Lawrence'
