      THE DANCERS

      The sun's north is the island's south.
      This is the shortest night is June.
      Delay as if it were the longest.

      Like unrooted flowers alive
      In pervasive and transparent water
      We follow seasons in an evening,
      Not free to die like autumn leaves
      But held within our vase of arms.

      When I dreamed of floating
      It was with you, it was this accord
      With music in the mid-summer.

      THE DUTCHMAN

      Where is he from, the character?
      His hair was like a windmill
      Reflected in a grey canal.
      Square in the door he mocked his peers
      With thoughts as sharp as moss and jokes
      Made sinister by provincial stages.

      He had his purpose, like a peasant
      In a double-plot: by standing still
      He defined our flight, as we floated
      Like acrobats across the big top.

      THE DANCERS

      The sun's north is the island's south.
      This is the shortest night is June.
      Delay as if it were the longest.

      Like unrooted flowers alive
      In pervasive and transparent water
      We follow seasons in an evening,
      Not free to die like autumn leaves
      But held within our vase of arms.

      When I dreamed of floating
      It was with you, it was this accord
      With music in the mid-summer.

      THE DUTCHMAN

      Where is he from, that charachter?
      His hair was like a windmill
      Reflected in a grey canal.
      Square in the door he mocked his peers
      With thoughts as sharp as moss and jokes
      Made sinister by provincial stages.

      He had his purpose, like a peasant
      In a double-plot: by standing still
      He defined our flighty, as we floated
      Like acrobats across the big top.
