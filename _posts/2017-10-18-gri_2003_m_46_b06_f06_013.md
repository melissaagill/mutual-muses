      Blackheath
      Saturday
      Dearest Sylvia
      I am so glad that your rehearsals re gong so well. Tho' I wish I were in M.M.'s place, I am pleased that he has turned out so well, after all.
      Reading your letter again I see you leave the fare to Wales to me. Even if I can find it the whole thing would be rather an expense for you. However, I wait for your comments on my last letter.
      Congratulations about another commission. That is really marvellous. You were right: things are really coming your way now. I am happy about it.
      Thank you for the Horizon. I look forward to reading it in a day or two. I have the Oxford Dictionary

      Dearest Sylvia

      I am so glad that your rehearsals are going so well. Tho' I wish I were in M.M.'s place, I am pleased that he has turned out so well, after all.

      Reading your letter again I see you leave the fare to Wales to me. Even if I can find it the whole thing would be rather an expense for you. However, I wait for your comments on my last letter.

      Congratulations about another commission. That is really marvellous. You were right: things are really coming your way now. I am happy about it.

      Thank you for the Horizon. I look forward to reading it in a day or two. I have the Oxford Dictionery
