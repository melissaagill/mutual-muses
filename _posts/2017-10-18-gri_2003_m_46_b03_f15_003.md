      3 Everyone feels well hee but it is very cold.
      Aunt Margaret has sent me a nice little piece of "Art Nouveau" jewellery - silver and turquoise.  I forgot the pink-crepe for July - but it doesn't matter - there's plenty to be going on with !

      Michael says he feels his notes are very inadequate - but suggests that deficiencies might be filled by [unclear]Fluget's[/unclear] book - 100 years of psychology (Duckworth) which pr√©cises each movement.  I think that a very useful idea,  I have just iced the cakes I hope you get this soon.

      I love you - sleep well my dearest, I love you.
