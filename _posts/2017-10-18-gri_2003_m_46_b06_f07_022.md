      Blackheath
      23 july
      Dearest Sylvia:
      Thank you for your letter and for the cutting from the TIMES. I am getting shy of writing to B'ham for jobs I don't get, but I shall certainly do so, perhaps this time successfuly.
      Your day at Rye sounds most enjoyable as well as productive of a watercolor. I'm afraid I don't know the view - I only wish i did. Anyway I am glad you have painted it.
      I hold myself ready for whatever comes at Bank Holiday. I am pleased the Woods are nicer.
      Let me know as soon as you have further details about the mural. I do hope that this comes off. It would be good for you and good for the place where the work is to be done.
      My lecture at the ICA seemed to go well - freer, I hope, han The Human Head one. Despite a charge of puritanism and over-intellectualism (who, me?), I was complimented by Peter Watson who said he agreed with nearly everything I said and by (of all people) Richard Hamliton's wife. Penrose was nice, too, though I think a little bit taken aback by some of my views. I really knocked Craxton, Vaughan, Herman, Froy, and Scott. My candour caused some comment, I think. I had lunch with Rayner Banham yesterday, by the way: he is nicer than I thought, I like him increasingly.
      Mrs Hamilton (I forget her last 1st name) asked after you and M and wanted to know how your show had gone. She was pleased at your sucess.
      What other news? I know, Turnbull is not living with his wife at present (though if the break is likely to be serious, I don't know).
      My Watts lecture was surprisingly well attended ( so was the ICA one despite filthy weather and wrong season): I discussed his history and sent him up. Even 18c. Child Portraiture seemed to be popular this afternoon.
      I am home after lecturing. I shall post this, bathe, dine, and then work on THE TRAVEL AGENT. I shall soon finish the Welsh poem.
      I love and adore you.
      Lawrence

      you for your leter and for the cutting from the TIMES. I am getting shy of writing

      successfully. <br/><br/>Your day at Rye sounds most enjoyable as well as productive
      of a watercolor. I''m afraid I don''t know the view- I only wish I did. Anyway

      at Bank Holiday. I am pleased the Woods are nicer.<br/><br/>Let me know as soon

      It would be good for you and good for the place where the work is to be done.<br/><br/>My
      lecture at the ICA seemed to go well- freer, I hope, than The Human Head one.
      Despite a charge of puritanism and over-intellectualism (who, me?), I was complimented
      by Peter Watson who said he agreed with nearly everything I said and by (of
      all people) Richard Hamilton''s wife. Penrose was nice, too, though I think
      a little bit taken aback by some of my views. I really knocked Craxton, Vaughan,
      Herman, Froy, and Scott. My candor caused some comment, I think. I had lunch
      with Rayner Banham yesterday, by the way: he is nicer than I thought, I like
      him increasingly. <br/><br/>Mrs. Hamilton (I forget her 1st name) asked after
      you and M  and wanted to know how your show had gone. She was pleased at your
