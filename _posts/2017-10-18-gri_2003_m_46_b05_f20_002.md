      2 ask Georgie if I should go to
      Ditching on the 14th (Thursday)
      if this should suit her I will stay
      the night and come on to London
      to you the next day (Friday or Saturday), when
      comvenient. Aunt Margaret has
      asked me for a week in the letter
      part of August so I could go
      on to Bath after staying with
      you for about a week - how would
      that suit you? Please let me know
      as soon as possible and I will
      try to fit it all in. I could
      easily make all the dates a little
      later if that would suit you better.
      George liked my paintings I think
      and sees in me something of the express-
      ionist, and someone mainly interested
      in colour. Frank wants to come
      and see my paintings by herself.
      Michael was very nice - but is
      frightfully thin - my Lion is
      positively stout! Compared!
