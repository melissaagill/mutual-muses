            5 xii '52

      Dearest Sylvia
         The view from the window is like a late Pasmore:  a few of the most elegant trees, and a pale blueish void beyond them, and, above, a gentle, orange, muggy sun.  It is a 10.30 winter morning sun.  I am sitting facing the window & a soft orange light is on the paper and the pen and my hand make a pale blue elongated shadow.
         I mentioned poems in an earlier letter.  Some of them you know already - for example MUSES which is now extensively rewritten, but here are a few bits and pieces I am working on.  First is a lyric as for a piece of dance-music (you know my perverse wish to master this style);

      What do you write
      In your diary at night
      After we've said goodnight?

      Do you say there
      What I most want to hear
      Or do you clinch my fear?

      Am I only, someone to go dancing with
      Someone to be late, never early with. . .

      It is not finished yet:  perhaps it isn't worth finishing.  Then there is a poem I started at Chester:

      The wall's a cat walk, town high.
      Tick of the town clock rocks a head.
      The going to light leaves us
      With foreign spurs dark on the river.

      Blackheath
      5 XII '52
      Dearest Sylvia
      The view from the window is like a late [unclear]Pasvore[/unclear]: a few of
      the most elegant trees, and a pale blueish void beyond them,
      and, above, a gentle, orange, muggy sun. It is a 10.30 winter
      morning sun. I am sitting [unclear][/unclear] the window & a soft orange
      light is on the paper and the pen and my hand make a pale blue
      elongated shadow.
      I mentioned poems in an earlier letter. Some of them you
      know already – for example MUSES which is now extensively
      rewritten, but here are a few bits and pieces I am working on,
      first is a lyric as for a piece of dance-music (you know my
      perverse wish to master this style):
      What do you write
      In you diary at night
      After we've said goodnight?

      Do you say there
      What I most want to hear
      Or do you clinch my fear?

      Am I only, someone to go dancing with
      Someone to be late, never early with....
      It is not finished yet: perhaps it isn't worth finishing.

      Then there is a poem I started at Chester:
      The wall's a cat walk, [unclear]town[/unclear] high.
      Talk of the town clock rocks a head.
      The going of light leaves us
      With foreign spaces dark on the river.

      Dearest Sylvia
      The view from the window is like late Pasmore: a few of the most elegant trees, and a pale blueish void beyond them, and, above, a gentle, orange, muggy sun. It is a 10.30 winter morning sun. I am sitting facing the window & a soft orange light is on the paper and the pen and my hand makes a pale blue elongated shadow.
      I mentioned poems in an earlier letter, some of them you know already - for example MUSES which is now extensively rewritten, but here are a few bits and pieces I am working on. First is a lyric as for a piece of dance music (you know my perverse wish to master this style):

      It is not finished yet: perhaps it isn't worth finishing. Then there is a poem I started at Chester:
      The wall's a cat walk, town high.
      Tick of the town clock rocks a head.
      The going of light leaves us
      With foreign spurs dark on the river.
