      to check it contemptuously.  I think, although wishing my comfort you would not wish my love milder.  Anymore than I would.  Thus you see my love, now it has come, dismissed the limitations I had supposed I would accpt before I was in love.  What price for my early dogma about love, now.  I adore you Sylvia and do not worry about me.  It is your love, which you gave so tenderly and fiercely, I want and not your worry.  My dearest Sylvia, I love you.

      I feel anything is rather an anti-climax after that but I want to ask about your exam-result.  Is Clifford going to open it if it comes in your absence?  You talked with him, or Tiny, as if he would.  If so, would he, or Tiny, do you think, let me know.  A simple line would do, but I should like to know...  Please.  I hope your tea has come by now.  Dandylion is sipping China tea even now and that reminded him.  I have go yet another lecture, the fourth, at the Gallery, on the 18th - on LandsKip.  A nice easy subject, that one.  "Please find enclosed an article on Canaletto and [unclear]Venese[/unclear] which may interest you".  Except for a judgment about his figure drawings I like it.

      I expect you are busy but I hope not too busy.  All my love.  Lawrence
