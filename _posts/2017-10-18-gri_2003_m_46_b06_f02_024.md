      I have to come to town for large vos. of lan-
      tern slides today and I think I shall take the
      chance to see the TURNER exh. at White Chapel.
      (The weather is vile - wet and cold - so, perhaps,
      I shall ljust return home, however.)

      My Yorkshire lectures are to last one instead
      of two weeks. I feared this would mean no
      suit. My parents, however, have offered to
      pay half. So I may be able to buy one, after
      all. It will mean I shall be in London for more
      of your exhibition which is a good thing.

      I love you, my darling, I love you
      Lawrence.
