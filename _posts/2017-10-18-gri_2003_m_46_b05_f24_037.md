      Dec 29 Rectory Lodge Pett. Dearest Lawrence,
      Thank you for sending such a
      Marvellous Christmas poem - I adore
      you. I hope you had a happy
      time - I shall be writing to my
      Aunt to find out when she would
      like to see me - I will let you
      know at once - perhaps you would
      tell me any convienent dates -
      on inconveinent dates! When you
      will be away from home. I shall
      only stay with Aunt a night
      this time - I must also make some
      final arrangements with Chase!
      Christmas went very well here -
      everyone delightful - Though I'm afraid
      Tiny didn't feel well or felt tired
      or something - she did her best but
      didn't seem very cheerful.
      I will write you directly. I love
      you, I love you
      Sylvia
