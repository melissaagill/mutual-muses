      Let's try to agree.

      The Dear Motherland

      1st KING:  Who me?
      2nd KING:  What are your war aims?
      Pass them in review.
      1st KING:  My armies hold back
      The beast that attacks
      The Family.
      2nd KING:  Get you.
      1st KING:  What are your war aims?
      Try and set it straight.
      2nd KING:  Stop your invasion.
      1st KING:  It's your invasion.
      2nd KING:  Oh, surely not.
      1st KING:  Play straight.
      2nd KING:  What are your war aims?
      1st KING:  Well, they seem the same as yours. (spoken)
      2nd KING:  Let's draw up a treaty.
