      that you will know how much I
      love you, and am thinking of you
      my only excuse is that Wassily
      is always posing for me and I
      haven't seen anything of Lionel
      for ages, and they wizzed by fairly
      quickly so I didn't really
      have time to get him tight!
      Micale M.S stay has gone off
      very well, and he has been pleasant
      and lively, Tiiny looked radiant!
      I am fairly well prepared for the
      decent of hte greenwoods!  I hope
      you have a good time and put on
      weight!
      I adore you, sweetheart,
      dearest one, my poet--and long
      to see you.
      I love you
      Sylvia
      A happy Christmas
