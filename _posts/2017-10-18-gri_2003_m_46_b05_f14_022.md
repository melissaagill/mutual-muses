      Dear Lawrence

      Thank you for letter-card.  I have now practically finished my picture - only the labels on the labels on the Benedictine bottle and the front of the table to do so that I ought to finish it tomorrow morning.  I am also priming canvases for my still life of jugs, and the big still life so that I shall keep on working hard - by the way - if you can, I should be very pleased if you get those pictures from [unclear]Bonslets [/unclear] as I will take them back with me.

      I'm so glad that your last two lectures went so well - I'm so glad that the [unclear]Pusso[/unclear] was useful!

      I am more cheerful again now - having been madly worried on Sunday.  I don't think I slept at all all night but yesterday I slept perfectly and I feel calm and more happy tonight - your card comforted.

      Tiny is very nice, only depressing

      12-2-52 Pett Dearest Lawrence,
      Thank you for your Letter-card. I have
      now practically finished my picture -
      only the labels on the Benedictive bottle
      and the front of the table to do so
      that I ought to finish it to-morrow
      morning. I am also priming canvases
      for my still-life of jugs, and tho
      big still-life so that I shall keep on
      working hard - By the way - if you
      can, I should be very pleased if you would
      get those pictures from Bowlets as I
      will take them back with me.
      I'm so glad that your last two lect-
      ures went so well - I'm so glad that the
      [unclear][/unclear] was useful!
      I am most cheerful again now -
      having been mostly worried on Sunday -
      I don't think I slept at all, all night,
      but yesterday I slept perfectly and
      I feel calm a more happy to-night.
      Tiny is really nice, only depressing.

      Pett

      Dearest Lawrence,
      Thank you for your letter-card.  I have
      now practically finished my picture--
      only the labels on the Benedictine bottle
      and the front of the table to do so
      that I ought to finish it tomorrow
      morning.  I am also priming canvases
      for my still life of jugs, and the
      big still life so that I shall keep on
      working hard.  By the way, if you
      can, I should be very pleased if you would
      get those pictures from Paourlets as I
      will take them back with me.
      I'm so glad that your last two lect-
      ures went so well.  I'm so glad that the
      Puffo was useful!
      I am more cheerful again now--
      having been madly worried on Sunday.
      I don't think I slept at all all night!
      But yesterday I slept perfectly and
      I feel calm and more happy tonight--
      your card comforted me.
      Tiny is very nice, only depressing.

      Dearest Lawrence,

      Thank you for your Letter-card, I have
      now practically finished my picture -
      only the labels on the Benedictine bottle
      and the front of the table to do so
      that I ought to finish it to-morrow
      morning. I am also priming canvases
      for my still-life of jugs, and the
      big still-life so that I shall keep on
      working hard - By the way - if you
      can, I should be very pleased if you would
      get those pictures from [unclear]Bourlets[/unclear] as I
      will take them back with me.

      I'm so glad that your last two lect-
      ures went so well - I'm so glad that the
      [unclear][/unclear] was useful!

      I am more cheerful again now -
      having been madly worried on Sunday -
      I don't think I slept at all all night
      but yesterday I slept perfectly and
      I feel calm and more happy to-night -
      your card comforted me.

      Tiny is very nice, only depressing.
