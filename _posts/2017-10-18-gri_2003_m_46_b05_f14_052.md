      It is just 5 to 11 and Clifford is due in a minute and we shall all have a cup of tea in the kitchen while he has his supper. I am writing this by the fire in my sitting-room where Tiny and I had supper some time ago. I had not had a fire here for some time. I thought it was about time! I have of course been mainly in the studio and had the stove on to paint the other still-life in the dining room. I expect you are on your way back from Banstead- I hope it went well. What was it this week?

      I think of you constantly, dear one. We often speak of you and wonder how things are with you- Tiny ad Clifford always ask after you when your letters arrive. I love to see you.
      I love you
      Sylvia.
