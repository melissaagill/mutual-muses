      Dearest Sylvia,
      Yes, your letter has reached me in time, with all your splendid /
      news about your picture.  How pleased I am that your ambitious /
      plan proceeds so well.  I am sure Saint Kurt's head will /
      be better now and I am inspired to hear that the child is drawn /
      in already.  Today is very overcast - I wonder if you are /
      going in the white hunt.  I am sorry to hear about the /
      washing - do not let that kind of thing interfere with the /
      flight.  How I envy to see it as you work on it I wish I were /
      there. /
         Do send me some pictures into the Kensington Saloon and [unclear] do ignore [/unclear]  /
      entirely the rework of that creep. M. /
         Last night's lecture at [unclear] Dalwich [/unclear] was satisfactory - that is to /
      say, nobody was bored but me.  I am going in the theatre /
      tonight with [unclear] rattles and fatle [/unclear] to see Knights of Madness (!) and I /
      am retiring to Wimbeldon for there is an alaram clock there /
      whereas here I might easily sleep too late.  The train leaves /
      imperial st. at 8:20 .... I have plenty of slides for the /
      lectures.  I'm glad to say, some of them very good. /
          Slyvia, my dearest - I love you.  Look after yourself and do /
      not be deterred from your art by M.  I love you and /
      will write again tomorrow from Ely.
                                                             Lawrence
           Also Sylvia - I adore you.
