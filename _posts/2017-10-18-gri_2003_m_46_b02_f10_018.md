      Blackheath
      27 xi 1949

      Dearest Sylvia,

        At least I have a day at home, which I badly need.  The flowers we bought are still alive and provide a note of strong red on the white walls which gives me great pleasure.  I have had a lazy long breakfast and can now write to you at leisure.

        You seem to have been working hard also:  I do not think I quite realize to whom you are giving the Aesthetics and Nature lecture again.  Do tell me.  I am so please that I shall soon hear your lecture at Wadhurst.

        I hope that we shall be able to meet on Saturday 3rd December.  I imagine the Greenwoods will not be coming that day as Michael will not be there.  I long to see you, and hear all that you have been doing, and tell you about me too, and spoil you.  And adore you.  And pose for you, too.

        Your suggestion about Redcar is one that had occurred to me.  I had not slept very well the evening before your letter came and I had been thoughtful.  I had reached the same conclusion that you seem to.  Much as I desire you to be with me I think it would be very difficult to pay for you and it would be better for us both, I think, if I went alone, then I should be paid for, and earn enough money to support us together for a time when I return.  It goes against my wishes very much but it seems best, alas.

        I am rather poor at the moment but I am in the reassuring position of being owed money by numerous people:  13, Birmingham University, 9 the National Gallery, and a few other sums.
