      Blackheath
      Friday
      Dearest Sylvia

      What a delightful letter is your latest.  I was still
      moving about sleepily this morning when I opened it and
      your words galvanised me into being awake and renewed the
      conviction that I love you passionately.

      With you letter came on from Schmanski who is going
      uo use The Third Man, definitely, in World Review, the
      next number.

      The discussion last night was amusing and I think to
      an objective observer Westbrook and I won; the voting,
      however, was level.  Graham Reynolds of the V and A spoke
      after Westbrook so my main task was to attack Reynolds,
      which I did vigorously, showing up the romantic-emotive
      arguments he was forced to use to support the
      English.  Arising out of the meeting I think I have made
      a very important contact for the future, I will tell you
      about it when you come, it is most exciting.

      Your new clothes sound lovely, I long to see them
      soon.  What a dazzlingly dressed muse I shall have,
      overpowering every other muse, dressed as undressed.

      Yes I have seen all the ballets you saw, though not
      with the dancers you mentioned.  Soiree Musicale is charm-
      ing I agree; the Bar however, misses the romanticism
      of Manet, otherwise it is pleasing.

      Your painting new is intriguing and I look forward to
      seeing you start work again.  It is most excitingly phrased
      in your letter, a strange head of Bacchus.

      I think Paul is in the revue; literally, he has to
      sleep with the producer, then he's in.  I am delighted
      at this news. (I mean the revue - not the night.)
      I love you
