      Miss Lacey - of whom you have heard - has been anxious to tale me to a cinema for some time, as you know.  I am not able to avoid it any longer and the happy day is Friday.  In some ways it is em-
      barressing (I ought to be taking an old lady out not the other way round) but at least I shall see [unclear][/unclear] a fish resin in which the author [unclear]ta[/unclear] a small pair himself.  As Eliot and his director have written a book about the making of the [unclear]fish[/unclear] I am anxious to see it.

      How are Clifford and Marjorie?  I do hope that they are at their nicest as they can be nicer than almost anybody if they are not tired or visiting Littlehampton.  Has Clifford bought any new pieces of glass?  Your lion is distinctly shocked at his extravagance.  You are usually the first to know!

       Mallarmé has written wonderful sonnets to [unclear]Puvis de Chavannes and Whistler[/unclear].  I read them last night and fascinating they are.  I must work hard if I am to produce poetry as light and as [unclear][/unclear] as  Mallarmé's.  He is astounding: I am alternately challenged and baffled, mainly challenged: I have managed to scribble down bits and pieces for a poem to finish the sequence you read the other day.

      Oh my darling I do love you so much.  I hope you are happy at Pett - calm and able to work, for your art is [unclear]consurrate [/unclear] and resourceful.  How I admire your new watercolours.
      I love you so much - think of me as I do of you.
      I love you
      Lawrence.

      Miss Lacey - of whom you have heard - has been anxious to take me to a cinema for some time, as you know. I am not able to avoid it any longer and the happy day is Friday. In some ways it is embarrassing (I ought to be taking an old lady out not the other way round) but at least I shall see Murder In The Cathedrail - the film version in which the author takes a small part himself. As Eliot and his director have written a book about the making of the film I am anxious to see it.

      How are Clifford and Marjorie? I do hope that they are at their nicest for that can be nicer than almost anybody if they are not tired or visiting Littlehampton. Has Clifford bought any new pieces of glass? Your lion is distinctly shocked at his extravagance. You are usually the first to know!

      Mallarme has written wonderful sonnets in Paris [unclear]de Clarannes[/unclear] and Whistler. I read them last night and fascinating they are.  I must work hard if I am to produce poetry as [unclear]light[/unclear] and as close as Mallarme's. He is astounding: I am alternately challenged and baffled. Mainly challenged: I have managed to scribble down bits and pieces for a poem to finish the sequence you read the other day.

      Oh my darling I do love you so much. I hope you are happy at Pett - calm and able to work, for your art is [unclear]consumate[/unclear] and resourceful. How I admire your new watercolors.

      I love you so much - think of me as I do of you

      Love you
      Lawrence
