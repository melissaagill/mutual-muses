      15 x 1948

      Dearest Sylvia,
      Reading Hazlitt I came across a quotation from Donne which meant a lot to me in the situations it evoked. I think you may respond too so I copy it out:

      'By our first strange fatal interview,
      By all desire which thereof did ensure,
      By our long starving hopes of that remorse
      which my words' masculine persuasive force

      Begat ...

      I love you, Sylvia.

      I saw [unclear]Antal[/unclear] and he suggests I drop my [unclear]Hogarts[/unclear] book since his is finished and will be definitive (7 years work is in it). Intellectually he is quite right but I intend rather to work faster. His book will not come out until after Beckett's (due in about a year), but i think he may hurry up if he thinks mine is about to appear. I must, however, double-cross him carefully for he has suggested a good idea for a book with which he would help. I'd like to follow it up. Do not, please, tell anybody outside the rectory at present.

      Wimbledon
      15 x 1948
      Dearest Sylvia,
      Reading [unclear]Maglitt[/unclear] I came across a quo-
      nation from Donne which meant a lot
      to me in the situations it evoked. I think
      you may respond too so I copy it out:
      'By our first strange fatal interview,
      By all desire which thereof did ensue,
      By our long starving hope, [unclear]by[/unclear] that remorse
      Which my words' masculine persuasive force
      Begot...'
      I love you, Sylvia.

      I saw [unclear]Antal[/unclear] and he suggests I drop my
      [unclear]Mogarts[/unclear] book since his is finished and will
      be definitive (7 years work is in it). Intel-
      lectually he is quite right but I intend
      rather to work faster. His book will not
      come out until after Beckett's (due in a-
      bout a year), but I think he may hurry
      up if he thinks mine is about to appear.
      I must, however, double-cross him care-
      fully for he has suggested a good idea
      for a book with which he [unclear]wanted[/unclear] help.
      I'd like to follow it up. Do not, please,
