      Dearest Sylvia
      I do hope you are well, not anxious.
      Have you heard from M? Even if he is
      upset it won't be forever. Let me know
      your news.
      Peter Banham has given me a lecture
      which he can't manage on Modern Sculpture
      at Dulwich (NOT, I think, in the Gallery).
      It pays 7 guineas I am glad to say: I
      shall be able to settle with the [unclear]mitzvah[/unclear] and
      we shall be solid and undisturbed during
      your visit.
      I am busy getting Autumn lectures ready.
      My course requires a great amount of work.
      Toni DelRensio has resigned (after a dispute)
      from the ICA exhibition sub-committee. I
      had a letter from [unclear]Penmore[/unclear] this morning
      inviting me on in his place: he, Peter Watson,
      Melville are the alters.
      See you very soon.
      Love you

      Dearest Sylvia
      I do hope that you are well, not anxious. Have you heard from M? Even if he is upset it won't be forever. Let me know your news.
      Peter Banlam has given me a lecture which he can't manage on Modern Sculpture at Dulwich (NOT, I think, in the Gallery). It pays 7 guineas I am glad to say: I shall be able to settle with the [unclear]milkman[/unclear] and we shall be solid and undisturbed during your visit.
      I am busy getting autumn lectures ready. My course requires a great amount of work.
      Toni del Renjco has resigned (after a dispute) from the ICA exhibitions sub-committee. I had a letter from Penrose this morning inviting me on in his place: he, Peter Watson Melville are the others.
      See you very soon.
      Love you
      Lawrence
