      and loving letter. It makes me very happy. How kind of you to send me Horizon
      so soon - and Masson: thank you, dearest love.\nI was interested in C's reasons
      for disliking Auden. I quite see that he preaches, and so does Eliot, so does
      Greene. But do Montherlant and Maurier really only state? Surely both these
      writers fix things to justify their own attitudes? Surely they only decide on
      the destiny of their characters, and so on, to express an attitude. I think
      the test is not objectivity versus preaching but whether form and content suit
      each other: not whether the content is legitimate outside the form but if it
      suits the form. By this test Auden at his best seems to me good. The content
      of Limestone is ridiculous: its relation to form exquisite. (That is my present
      view though I acknowledge the pressures which cause one to take sides.) \nDelighted
      that Armida progresses so well. Admirable: I am pleased. (I read the Nicholson
      article in the Burlington Magazine at breakfast (because you said you had read
      it): I agree it is disjointed - but what a nice frontispiece, don't you think?)
      \ I long to see R and A again. It is a tradition which starts in the South,
      comes North (to the frontispiece, e.g.), then is southernised again in the Roccoco.\nMy
      film book goes very well. I have written a 1000 words, at least, on Dreamboat
      which I saw yesterday. In fact I probably should not have gone to the cinema
      yesterday - nor worked on my lectures at the Tate Gallery as long as I did,
      for my glands have swollen again. However, Dreamboat is excellent: you should
      certainly see it. Kiss Me Kate was very enjoyable, also - quite well handled
      by a Touring Co. with Chris. Hewett (of the Watergate Review) in the lead.\nWhat
      marvellous news about yet another American letter of praise for the Rector.
      I know ow much C admires Ellis, too. Do congratulate him for me. I am sorry
      Haine is little better: how extraordinary about New Zealand. I am disgusted
      with that ridiculous place.\nLion is gradually collecting material for the Sex
      Lecture (I seem I am in a What's On advertisement for the Sex Ed. Soc!), not
      all of which I may use, but I would like a margin. Something we left out was
      a case history or two of particular artists: I shall try and work on in (Hogarth,
      Nijinsky, Leonardo - I don't know who yet), {how about The Psychopathology of
      Dame Laura Knight?]\nLincoln Girls' School mistake me for Superman. They want
      3 lectures in the morning: in the afternoon I introduce 5 art films; in the
      evening another lecture. However no duties on Saturday to speak of & I shall
      get Â£15.\nThe Nov. Athene progresses well: even the \"May\" one advances.\nDo

      other: not whether the content is legitimate outside the form but if it suits
      the form. By this test Auden at his best seems to me good. The content of Limestone

      the test is not objectivity versus preaching but whether form and content suit
      each other: not whether the content is legitimate outside the form but if it
      suits the form. By this test Auden at his best seems to me good. The content
      of Limestone is ridiculous: its relation to the form exquisite. (That is my
      present view through I acknowledge the pressures which cause one to take sides.)<br/>Delighted
      that armido progresses so well. Admirable: I am pleased. (I read the Nicholson
      article in the Blue Mag at breakfast (because you said you had read it): I agree
      it is disjointed - but what a nice frontispiece, don''t you think?) I long to
      see R and A again. It is in a tradition which starts in the South, comes North
      (to the frontispiece, e.g), then is southernised again in the rococo.<br/>My
      film book goes very well. I have written a 1000 words, at least, on Dreamboat
      which I saw yesterday. In fact I probably should not have gone to the cinema
      yesterday - nor worked on my lecture at the Tate gallery as long as I did, for
      my glands have swollen again. However, Dreamboat is excellent: you should certainly
      see it. Kiss me Kate was very enjoyable, also - quite well handled by a Touring
      Co with chris hemmett (of the Watergate Review) in the lead.<br/>What marvellous
      news about yet another American letter of praise for the Rector. I know how
      much C admires Ellis, too. Do congratulate him for me. I am sorry Haire is little
      better: how extra-ordinary about New Zealand. I am disgusted with that ridiculous
      place.<br/>Lion is gradually collecting material for the Sex Lecture (I see
      I am in a Went''s Own Advertisement for the Sex. Ed. Soc!), not all of which
      I may use, but I would like a margin. something we left out was a case history
      of two particular artists: I shall try and work one in (Hogarth, Nijinsky, Leonardo
      - I don''t know who yet). [How about The Psychopathology of Dowelama Knight?]<br/>Lincoln
      Girls'' school mistake me for superman. They want 3 lectures in the morning:
      in the afternoon I introduce 5 art films; in the evening another lecture. However
      no duties on Saturday to speak of and I shall get lb15.<br/>T6 Nov. Athens progresses
      well: even the "may" one advances.<br/>Do not worry about me. My glands will
      go down again over the weekend - certainly by the time you read this on Monday.
      I shall do my work in a semi-horizontal position: LION as recumbent reader.
      I shall not give up any more lectures as long as I still have a chin!<br/>I
      adore you sweetheart,<br/>Adore you<br/>Lawrence'
