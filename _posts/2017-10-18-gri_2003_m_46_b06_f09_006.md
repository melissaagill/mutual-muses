      American visitors - an achitectural student & his wife -are charming. I enjoyed
      meeting them: i believe you would like them, too. I collected a deal of information
      about U.S. architecture - or rather, U.S. architects which is more amusing.<br/>I
      love you. You are constantly in my thoughts. Oh how I love you. Soon now I should
      earn enough for us. I adore you, you are my life.<br/>Love you<br/>Lawrence'
