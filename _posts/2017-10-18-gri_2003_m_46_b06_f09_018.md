      the LCC this time. However they want me on Mondays & Wednesdays. So unless they can change the days then is nothing doing. It is in [unclear]Santi Udon[/unclear], too, so it would be convenient.
      I am spending the day at Wimbledon, though in the evening I am going to dine with Geoffry = he is the boy who shares the ICA [unclear]bus[/unclear] with David. So I shall learn all the D over st. gossip I imagine.
      I will write again tomorrow my dearest love. Do not worry. Paint hard.  Look after yourself.
