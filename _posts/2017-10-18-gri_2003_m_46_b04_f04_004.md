      The symbolist and the Postman

      How fitful were the correspondences
      That answered the uneven senses
      Of the synaesthetic poets?
      A sign invoked what lavender,
      What gong struck yellow velvet,
      What stars flashed at the strings whirr?

      The postman hesitates
      Coy as a Muse by the laurels' gate:
      His correspondence is as wayward
      As the colours of the vowels.
      Will my senses outwit your word
      Or your love claim the answer of its equal?

      During the Night

      Runes trespass on my garbled sleep:
      A nun who committed suicide by jumping
      From the roof would lie in such a chaos
      of crumpled, mauled linen as I do.

      Smoke signals of Sodom and Gomorrah
      Char the eyelids of the sky:
      Swimming underwater brings relief
      Until we plunge in crumpled waterfalls.

      So now I am awake, alone in bed.
      Soon in the Summer we can lie
      On towels crumpled as a nun's linen,
      Forgetful of these nights - misers of sleep.
