      2.0.

      I spent this morning struggling up by the
      Church the wind getting gradually
      higher and higher until by 12 . O'clock
      it was impossible to do any more
      work.  I had started at
      10.30.  I am, however, pleased to have
      achieved something;  and have done
      a good deal of the hill on which
      Fairlight Church stands.  The afternoon
      being dull and windy and feel disinc-
      lined to stand at the top of [unclear]Far'l[/unclear]
      Hill this afternoon.  The forecast is
      rain.  M. has suggested that we go
      over to Rye to see any possibilities
      for a shop there.

      Thank you so much for your 2 letters
      which came this morning when I
      had finished the first part of this letter.
      I particularly enjoy the picture of
      Dandy "au cafe".  I wonder how
      long you are staying with Peter.
