      33.    I very much admire your
      handwriting article and thank
      you very much for sending it.
      It is lucid and well balanced,
      Renaissance itself!  I wish
      such writing were not so rare.
      Cliffords lecture seems to
      have gone very well, with
      a large audience.  I will
      ask about Walton.  I forget.
      But this morning an American
      journal has written asking
      for suggestions for articles,
      it is very exciting.
      I have some catalogues
      from Canorics which I have
      not sent on as they are
      nearly out of their envelope
      I will bring them if interesting.
      I find that Clifford
