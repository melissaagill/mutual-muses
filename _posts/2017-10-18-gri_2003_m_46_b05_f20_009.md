      3 Life size on the first floor so that
      the ladies could look unseen into
      the hall from the sola
      rather like
      that - only
      light shines
      through the eyes
      and mouth.
      Next we went to the Court, [unclear]Holt[/unclear], not
      far away where once William IV Lived
      when Duke of York with Mme Jordan's -
      they had 10 children! There is a
      most lovely garden of lawns, yews,
      box and rectangular ponds. I do
      love English gardens, walking on lovely
      narrow lawns & enchanting vistas.
      I was reminded vividly if vaguely of
      my childhood poetry book, and a
      half-remembered quotation - "These garden
      glories.....rosy sweet remembrances of thee".
      How I love you. No garden is complete
      without you for me. We seem to have
      wandered in charming gardens together
      if not so summery as these. But
      I feel that I have always had you
