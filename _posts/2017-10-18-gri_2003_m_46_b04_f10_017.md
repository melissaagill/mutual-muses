      How can the country thrive
      (I pickled apples that had fallen down up
      Warm orbs; cold dew. I hesitated)
      When the Monarch's half-alive

      Time its trellis that racks the Rose
      The dual-coloured 16th century Rose

      The price of bread rises higher than the corn
      The mail is slower despite the profile (Regal edge)

      What are ceremonies to the dropping
      Though oracles echo in more boxes
      What use are ceremonies
      To the dropping the withered

      How many years ago should he not have gone
      Before these macabre whimsies in & around Westminster Abbey

      What are the stains on the ribs of the House
      The flapping clouds
      The swelling in the pavement

      Crown jewels are petrified explosions of light
      And warm no one

      (Sweet yawn roam softly)
      The minister in laurel offers no
      Conciliatory paradoxes.
      Too slow to rise, much too slow,
      Like brown autumn jelly, then- bone,
      Like the collapsing Monarch, propped
      On crutches of a throne.

      The air which carries our yawns
      Mist alphabets that melt
      In the empty grove.

      The wheel breaks
      called Fortune
      and it breaks
      or sticks dead
      In tweed
      In kilt
      Soldier in uniform
      admiral or
      Grandfather or symbol

      the king on the fast wheel
      is every character in a dance of death

      How can the country thrive
      (I picked apples that had fallen down up
      Warm orbs; cold dew. I hesitated)
      When the Monarch's half-alive

      Time is the trellis that racks the Rose
      The dual-coloured 16th centurey Rose

      The price of bread rises higher than the corn
      The mail is slower despite the profile (Regal edge)

      What are ceremonies to the dropping
      Though oracles echo in more boxes
      What use are ceremonies
      To the dropping the withered

      How many years ago should he not have gone
      Before these macabre whimsies in & around Westminster Abbey

      What are the stains on the ribs of the House
      The flapping clouds
      The swelling in the pavement

      Crown jewels are petrified explosions of light
      And warm no one

      (Sweet yawn roam softly)
      The minister in laurel offers no
      Conciliatory paradoxes.
      Too slow to rise, much too slow
      Like brown autumn jelly, then - bone,
      Like the collapsing Monarch, propped
      On crutches of a throne.

      The air which carries our yawns
      Mist alphabets that melt
      In the empty grove.

      The whell breaks
      called Fortune
      and it breaks
      or sticks dead
      In tweed
      in kilt
      Soldier in uniform
      admir
      al or
      Grandfather or symbol
      the king on the fast wheel
      is every character in a dance of death
