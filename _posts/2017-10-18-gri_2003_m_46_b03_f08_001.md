      I'm glad you've put the spring landscape over your bed. I do think that room needed something

      Give M my love at the weekend. I hope you enjoy his visit. I am desolate to here you've had a bad period. I bet I know why. Now the Hicks are gone do - please - relax. Are you better now, my love?

      The pants mother offered me are fine. I am going to have them tapered: very pale worsted flannel of rather good quality.

      I love you so much. Come earlier if you can tho I shall have a few lectures - only an average number, tho'.

      I love and adore you, dearest Sylvia

      Blackheath
      3 September
      Dearest Sylvia
      I am so happy that your visitors were so pleasant. I wondered how
      they would be, and that they gave you pleasure makes me like them.
      Glad Audrey understands about 'lyrical realism'. By the way, I hope
      your painting arrives safely. I'll do my best to wrap it safely.
      Thursday 24th or Friday 25th would be fine. I have no lectures
      in the latter part of that week the [unclear]Harpenden[/unclear] starts on Monday
      28th and [unclear]Banston[/unclear] on Wed 30th.
      I'm glad you've put the Spring landscape over your bed. I
      do think that room needed something.
      Give M my love at the weekend. I hope you enjoy his visit
      I am desolate to hear you've heard a bad period. I bet
      I know why. Now the [unclear]Hicks[/unclear] are gone do - please -
      relax. Are you better now, my love?
      The pants [unclear]mother[/unclear] offered me are fine. I am going to
      have them tapered: very pale worsted flannel of rather
      good quality.
      I love you so much. Come earlier if you can tho I
      shall have a few lectures - only an average number,
      tho'.
      I love and adore you, dearest Sylvia
      Love you
      Lawrence
      P.S. Roy Edwards didn't turn up last night but I saw Roland Penrose
      [unclear]Lee[/unclear] Miller which was probably much nicer.
