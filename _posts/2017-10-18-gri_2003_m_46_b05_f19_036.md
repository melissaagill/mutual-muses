      most displeased.
      I hope you found Mandy getting on
      well--poor child what a life.  I wish
      I could send my love.
      I don't know if I told you, I have
      finished the "Tyre Funess"--it looks
      very well in its gold frame.  I
      couldn't finish the water colour it
      was too windy and the beach too
      crowded.
      I like your description of Katherine
      Hepburn.  I have never read "the
      millionaress".
      Now rest there's a good lion--
      I feel rather vexed with you.
