      2. I do hope that you will be able to
      get some more work even if you
      do not get job at the moment.
      I'm so glad that your Sculpture-
      lecture was so well attendeed, and
      that Madelaine came. Do give her
      my love if - or when rather, you see
      her again. I shall be interested
      to hear about the ward, and I hope
      that you get even more extra lectures.
      We had a very pleasant time at
      Canterbury,[unclear][/unclear] and I went round
      the cathedral together very thoroughly
      and I enjoyed myself very much
      and I think she did.
      I shall look forward to having
      your poems. I hope the New Yorkers
      arrived safely.
      The Savages come to-morrow and
      I have been hanging the studio. -
      I feel rather tired because of the
      date - I slept well yesterday.

      2. I do hope that you will be able to
      get some more work even if you
      do not get a job at the moment
      I'm so glad that your sculpture
      feature was so well attended, and
      that [unclear]Madelaine[/unclear] came. Do give her
      my love if – or when rather, you see
      her again. I shall be interested
      to hear about the ward; and I hope
      that you get even more extra lectures!
      We had a very pleasant time at
      Cantebury, [unclear]MJJ[/unclear] and I went round
      the Cathedral together very thoroughly
      and I enjoyed myself very much
      and I think she did.
      I shall look forward to having
      your poems. I hope the New Yorker
      arrived safely
      The Savages come to-morrow and
      I have been [unclear]hanging[/unclear] the studio. –
      I feel rather tired because of this
      date – I slept well yesterday.
