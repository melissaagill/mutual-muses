      3 discuss this with M. Will you make a draft of your catalogue introduction - I don't know how long it should be - but I'd like to know soon what you are going to say - then I can tell other people! - including the reporter!
      Tiny and I are planning to have a small party - Lines The Savages and a few others when you are down in Jan - Mary to ensure somebody coming to the private view. Do add all the addresses you can think of to the address book.
      George and Beryl like you so much and said they were so grateful to me for introducing you to them. George said that you and he were the best lecturers at the Art School
