      Pett. 14.7.52

      Dearest Lawrence
      I enclose an advertizement which I think should appeal to you, and which, I imagine you would be very likely to get.
      Thank you for the train informat-ion - I will catch the 5.14 which seems a very good train and just about the right time for us both.
      I will try & arrange to go to town on the days when you are going. On Thursday I expect to be lunching with father unless he is suddenly ill! I shall work on the portrait in the mornings and perhaps early afternoons when possible! It depends if the young lady is interest-ed enough to sit! I suggest that if I should have to go on other days that you stay at home and do some
