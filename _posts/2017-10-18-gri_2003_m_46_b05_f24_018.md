      Thank you for the letters, poems,
      and projects all of which I heartily
      approve! and I adore the drawings!
      Do let me know what time would
      be best to come on Saturday and
      I will find a suitable train - and
      say if I should come to Charing
      X or Victoria. I should't have
      much luggage I hope. I hope
      you have a nice time with the
      Johnsons to-morrow, I look forward
      to hearing all about the lecture -
      I wonder what Film you are going
      to see.
      To my intense relief, I had
      a letter and form and a card from
      Chase this morning - the 5th is
      o'clock. (I mean O.K.) I shall
