      delighted to. I have bought 3 frames which are 26 x 33 - or there abouts, which I think will do nicely - 2 are maple, and one is a nice silver gilt - I bought 6 frames altogether for a £1- one 24-20 - which is always useful - and one for the big watercolour of you all in the garden, and one very big one for my mural for the imaginary cafe. I have asked M. about the canvases and ordered one for my [unclear]Armida[/unclear] frame and the [unclear]mural[/unclear] as well! I shall let Mrs Bergman pay for one as one frame has a stretcher and I can re-cover it so that I shall only be paying for one extra and that will save carriage - I think I will get [unclear][/unclear] to fetch the canvases and then you need not bother. Mrs B can pay for it won't cost much more.
