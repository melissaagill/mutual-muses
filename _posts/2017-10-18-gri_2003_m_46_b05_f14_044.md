      26-2-52 Pett Dearest Lawrence,
      Thank you for the spendid picture
      from 'Lion News and Review', it's most im-
      pressive. What conclusion did these
      scientific lions come to?

      My cold is quite well now -
      yes, I found some horrid lozenges in
      the bath-room cupboard!

      Zoe [unclear]Vakey[/unclear] played the cat - she
      looked most amusing and was very
      lively - but I think lacked that
      essential dignity which is necessary
      to cat hood of the best kind! She
      was very gay however, and did an
      amusing balloon dance, preceeded
      by an excellent feline love song!

      I don't mean to cavil at the
      1890's, I did and do enjoy it,
      but I thought you'd like an opinion.
      I think I shall leave the last two
      chapters for the 'bus , so I have
