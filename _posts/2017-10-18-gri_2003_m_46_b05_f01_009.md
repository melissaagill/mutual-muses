      Dearest Sylvia,
        This cannot be too long a letter as I am in the N.G. [unclear]8[/unclear] it is being closed in a few moments.  But I did want to send my love to you for the weekend and I cannot bear the thought of not being able to send you my love for two days unless I write now.  So- dearest love, I am yours, I adore you.  You are my life.  I could not possibly live without you- Muse, lover, beauty, painter.  I have been re-reading your letters - happily and with delight.  Oh my darling - how I love you.
          The Belgian Institute, by the way, has lent me piles of books for my low countries lecture.  It is only now that I love sufficient literature that I realise how anxious I had become.  (I will keep them until you can see them.)
         The [unclear]j elasques[/unclear] lecture ([unclear]lile[/unclear] the whole series) was a [unclear]glon[/unclear].  7 people in the lecture room of the N.G.! (That is why I stopped early.)  C-T is lecturing there at 6:00 by the way tonight...  No- not even for laughs willI go.  [unclear]When[/unclear] you will come with me.  Wouldn't he like that!

      The [unclear]Lodius[/unclear] Room tonight - with 7 people.  They are all there if you look carefully.   That is where you sit.

      I love you
      Lawrence

      Dearest Sylvia

      This cannot be too long a letter as I am in at N. G. &
      it is being closed in a few moments. But I did want
      to send my love to you for the weekend and I cannot bear
      the though of not being able to send you my love for two days
      unless I write now. So - dearest love, I am yours, I
      adore you. You are my life. I could not possibly
      live without you - Muse, lover, beauty, painter. I have
      been re-reading your letters - happily and with delight,
      oh my darling - how I love you.

      The Belgian Institute, & the way, has sent me piles of
      books for my low countries lecture. It is only now that
      I have sufficient literature that I realise how anxious I
      had become. (I will keep them until you can see them.)

      The Velasquez lecture (like the inlalo series) was a
      flop. 7 people in the lecture-room of the N.G.! (That
      is why I stopped early.) Alle C-T is lecturing there at
      6.00 & the way tonight... No - not even for laughs
      will I go. When you will come with me. Wouldn't he
      like that!

      This cannot be too long a letter as I am in the N.G. & it is being closed in a few moments. But I did want to send my love to you for the weekend and I cannot bear the thought of not being able to send you my love for two days unless I write now. So - dearest love, I am yours, I adore you. You are my life. I could not possibly live without you - Muse, lover, beauty, painter. I have been re-reading your letters - happily and with delight. Oh my darling - how I love you.
      T6 Belgian Institute, by the way, has lent me piles of books for my low Countries lecture. It is only now that I have sufficient literature that I realise how anxious I had become. (I will keep them until you can see them.)
      T6 velasque lecture (like the whale series) was a flop. 7 people in the lecture room of the N.G.! (That is why I stopped early.) C.T. is lecturing there at 6.00 by the way tonight ....  No.  not even for laughs will I go. Unless you will come with me. Wouldn't be like that!
      T6 Lecture Room tonight with 7 people. They are all there if you look carefully.
      This is where you used to sit.
      I love you
