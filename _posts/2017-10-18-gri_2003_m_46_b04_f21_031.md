    annotation_text: 6. Blessed!) Ending as the death [unclear][/unclear]with Katherine
      Pass. What do you think-perhaps it is very trite? I am trying to think of it
      3 dimensionally and without time; that is to say that cause and effect of action
      may be known at the same time. I hope to do this by the introduction of the
      Fates at the beginning-though they will be part of the festivities of Katherine's
      arrival! I shall quote [unclear][/unclear] on the remaking of history at the
      head of it! I don't know when Tiny is coming back. There seems little hope for
      Doris. Greta stays day and night for Doris is very excitable-almost hysterical
      and cannot do without her. She gets much better, is lively, eats well, and then
      collapses again. This is the pattern of the disease Waddington
