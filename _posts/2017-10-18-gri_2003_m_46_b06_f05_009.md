      I hope that as Apollo the weather will
      please and flatter you on Friday.

      Yawalla had hoped to give you a
      vespa but it wouldn't start and
      he only just escaped. He is sad
      not to have it for you in time.
      Hetty is running up a dress for you:
      'it's the pockets that take the time,
      oh dear' she said.

      Look after yourself: be happy.
      I adore you and love you.
      Happy birthday
      love you
      Lawrence
