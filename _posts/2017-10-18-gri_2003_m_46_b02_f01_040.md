           John Skipp rang up this morning and told me that Sherwood had been in to see him and is delighted with my work at Bilston.  Skipp wants me to do more lecturing for him - at St. Albans and Skegness among other places.  I'm inclined not to.  What do you think?

           Molly rang up too and was surprised I was not at Blackheath yet.  She said I was to go  there at once - what would Sylvia think of my delay.  So I shall go on Thursday.

           Also Gainsborough rang up and wants me to review an interesting sounding exhibition at Rowland, Browse, & D.

           My other news is simply and directly that I love you, long for you, and implore you for action, not this Hamlet-like pattern of conflicting motives.  Act for love and for your Dandylion, please, please, my Dearest.  i will look after you and I love you.

    clean_transcription: John Skipp rang up this morning and told me that Sherwood
      had been in to see him and is delighted with my work at Bilston.  Skipp wants
      me to do more lecturing for him - at St. Albans and Skegness among o-ther places.  I'm
      inclined not to.  What do you think?<br/><br/>Molly rang up and was surprised
      I was not at Blackheath yet.  She said I was to go there at once - what would
      Sylvia think of my delay.  So I shall go on Thursday.<br/><br/>Also Gainsborough
      rang up and wants to review an interesting sounding exhibition at Rowland, Browse,
      & D.<br/><br/>My other news is simply and directly that <br/>I love you, long
      for you, and implore you for action, not this Ham-let-like pattern of conflicting
      motives.  Act for love and for your Dandylion, please, please, my Dearest.  I
      will look after you and I love you.<br/><br/>                                                  Lawrence
