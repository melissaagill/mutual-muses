      any arrangements you may have so perhaps you would let me know which you prefer! The kensington private view is on the 16th.
      Have you heard from the other 2 yet? I hope you had a pleasant tea with Robert Hart. If you should get any lectures from Charles - do accept them when reasonable!
      I have worked a little more on Tiny's portrait - really tight now! and alone a not good water-colour of Bath.
      My darling one, I hope all is well with you - I must haste and catch the post. I love you, my darling
      I love you
      Sylvia
