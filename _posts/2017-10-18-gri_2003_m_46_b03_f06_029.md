      Paris 12 July 1950
      Dearest Sylvia
      Many thanks for your long and interesting letter - of exactly the kind a
      lion likes. Your pageant sounds as if it must have been admirable,
      judging from your vivid description. I am glad a Jack-of-the-green
      was found room for. Your letter is not with me at present (I am in
      a cafe across the [unclear]rues[/unclear] from the end Pavilion of the Louvre, a sinister
      yellow drink before me) but your attitude about your paintings is
      excellent. I hope you will finish some more soon.
      Today I did not wake until very late (11 'clock) so I only spent
      the afternoon at a museum. I have just left the Petit Palais where I
      have paid particular attention to the [unclear]motley[/unclear] sculptures in la vierge
      dans l'art francais. I have an illustrated catalogue - as I have
      of the Louis XV et [unclear]Rocaille[/unclear] & I will show them to you with rare
      pleasure on my return.
      This morning I am having dinner with Jeanne Koepfer: she is
      leaving Paris in a day or so. Peter Simmons of course is jealous
      of my friendship with her as his American girl is rather elusive.
      Yesterday I went in St Chappelle but Tuesday it is fermee. I have,
      however, been to Notre Dame at last, after years, and admired it
      very much. Apart from that I saw no galleries & finished some
      poems, copies of which I will include in my next letter.
      I think of you all the while, wishing so much you were with me.
      The pond in the Tuilleries where we sat the evening before travel-
      ling to Italy has become a favourite nostalgia place for your
      lion. I am slightly depressed, missing you very much, &
      longing to see you again.
      I have made a sketch of the C15th fresco of The Flight into
      Egypt, in the Petit Palais, which may interest you. It is full
      of castles, rivers, slopes, trees, as, I hope, the sketch shows. I
      liked it very well to draw it for you as there is no photograph
      of it.

      Paris

      Dearest Sylvia
      Many thanks for your long and interesting letter - of exactly the kind lion likes. Your pageant sounds as if it must have been admirable, judging from your vivid description. I am glad a [unclear]Jack[/unclear]-of-the-Green was found room for. Your letter is not with me at present (I am in a cafe across the river from the end pavilion of the Louvre, a sinister yellow drink before me). but your attitude about your paintings is excellent. I hope you will finish some more soon.
      Today I did not wake until very late (11 o'clock) so I only spent the afternoon at a museum. I have just left the Petit Palais where I have paid particular attention to the Gothic sculpture in La [unclear]Vierge[/unclear] dans l'art francais. I have an illustrated catalogue - as I have of the Louis XV et Rocaille & will show them to you with rare pleasure on my return.

      This evening I am having dinner with Jeanne Koepfer: she is leaving Paris in a day or so. Peter Simmons of course is jealous of my friendship with her as his American girl is rather elusive.

      Yesterday I went to St. Chappelle but Tuesday it is fermee. I have, however, been to Notre Dame at last, after years, and admired it very much. I thought of you so hard as I went conscientiously over the church. Apart from that I saw no galleries & finished some poems, copies of which I will include in my next letter.

      I think of you all the while, wishing so much you were with me. The pond in the Tuilleries where we sat the evening before travel-ling to Italy has become a favorite nostalgic place for your lion. I am slightly depressed, missing you very much, & longing to see you again.

      I have made a sketch of a c 15th fresco of the Flight into Egypt, at the Petit Palais, which may interest you. It is full of [unclear]cattle[/unclear], rivers, ships, trees, as, I hope, the sketch shows. I liked it very well & drew it for you as there is no photograph of it.

      I love you
