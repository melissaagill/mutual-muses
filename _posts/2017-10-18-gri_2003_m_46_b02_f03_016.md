      love you.<br/>Of course you look well, my darling,<br/>my rose, and I am delighted
      that your<br/>works are admired by everybody. I look<br/>forward to the day
      when I review them in<br/>ART NEWS. I shall use the name Lionel <br/>Chat -
      then people will not know I am the <br/>gentleman of whom there are several
      portraits.<br/>Or perhaps Lawrence Dandelion.... Well - <br/>we'll see.<br/>By
      the way Gainsborough wants me to do<br/>a whole column on Denis Mahon which<br/>pleases
      me very much.<br/>Which picture did you do finally yester-<br/>day - the House,
      or daffodils?<br/>Do certainly get the 'smaller dish and 2<br/>
