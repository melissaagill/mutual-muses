      Thursday
      My dearest Sylvia
      The Leicester Gallery expects you 1.030ish (the time you suggested) & Chase, during the morning, somewhat before 12.30 which (as I work it out) will be just nice time.
      Tomorrow I shall stay at home & do the dusting to receive you on Saturday. I stayed at Wimbledon after Banstead and am now - 4.30 - on the way home (perhaps to a letter from you).
      I'm dying to see you again. You shall love breakfast in bed ALL day Sunday at least - waited on by Hetty, read to by Lionel, cuddled by Dandy - while Y will burst in every now & again with a grubby snowball, only to be intercepted by Dandy. I love you
      Lawrence

    clean_transcription: Thursday<br/>My dearest Sylvia<br/>The Leicester Gallery
      expects you <br/>10.30ish (the time you suggested)<br/>& close, during the morning,
      some-<br/>what before 12.30 which (as I<br/>work it out) will be just nice time.<br/>Tomorrow
      I shall stay at home &<br/>do the dusting to receive you on<br/>Saturday. I
      stayed at Wimbledon after<br/>Banstead and am now - 4.30 - on<br/>the way home
      (perhaps to a letter from<br/>you).<br/>I am dying to see you again. You<br/>shall
      have breakfast in bed ALL<br/>day Sunday at least - waited on<br/>by Hetty,
      read to by Lionel, cud-<br/>dled by Dandy - while Y will burst<br/>in every
      now & again with a grubby snow<br/>ball, only to be intercepted by Dandy. I
      love you<br/>Lawrence
