      Dearest Lawerence,
      Thank you for your letter, [unclear]I am[/unclear] close to the snaps which I think awfully good, but unfortunately the reporter says they wouldn't come. So I shall give him all studio portrait if I can find one! But I thought the one with my back to the rose garden, the one leaning on the sundial I would have enlarged and send one to Rouge - I think the rose garden- it shows the clothes off best. I enclose a rough of a letter to the art editor of that magazine. [unclear]Sivy[/unclear] thinks it  [unclear]very[/unclear] good and I have caught Rouge's style! I want the p s as such by it not quite [unclear]germain[/unclear] to the letter but I think would [unclear]there of then[/unclear]- I hope you approve- and wondered if you would be so good

      P.S Any remarks about your hair?

      Pett.                   4-2-53

      Dearest Lawrence,
         Thank you for your letter, I en-close the snaps which I think awfully good, but unfortunately the reporter says that they wouldn't come. So I shall give him an old studio portrait, if I can find one! But I thought the one with my back to the rose-garden the one [unclear]leaning[/unclear] on the sun dial I would have enlarged and send one to Vogue - I think the rose-garden - it shows the clothes off best. I enclose a rough of a letter to the art Editor of that magazine - Tiny thinks it very good and I have caught Vogue's style! I want the P.S as such for it is not quite germain to the letter but I think would interest them - I hope you  approve - and wondered if you would be so good

      P.S. Any remarks about your hair?
