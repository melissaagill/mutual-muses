      Dearest Lawrence
      I was so delighted to
      have such an exhuberant letter
      from you this morning--one on
      top of the world Lion--I
      hope you had a good time
      at Lincoln.  I feel sure that
      you did.  I am longing to
      hear all about it.  I am
      sorry not to have written
      quite as often as usual.  I
      have been feeling guilty about
      the library book and hoped
      to finish writing the notes and
      get it and a letter off to
      you this afternoon, but some
      how I didn't manage to.
      I shall do my best to get
      it off by the 1st post on
      Monday.  It uses due back
      yesterday--it is dated Oct 10
