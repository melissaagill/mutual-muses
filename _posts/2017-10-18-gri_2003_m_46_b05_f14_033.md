      3.    The WEA visitor's suggestion focus ex-
      cellent.  I hope that it works!
      I wish that you could have one of
      the NG London University extension
      courses!
      I'm so glad that Molly enjoyed our
      meeting.  I thought she did as she
      stayed so long (!) and I enjoyed it also.
      You must ask her over when I am
      in town again.
      Your picture of me cleaning is fairly
      just!  Except that--fearing the billowing
      cloud of dust that you mention--I
      need the vacuum cleaner!
      I like your poem--it is a very in-
      teresting idea.  You must try some more
      in their vein.  Luis one is deliciously ev-
      ocative.  You too are a Dandy, my
      poet! but a joyous life-accpeting one.
      Your new film capter is a very good
      idea--though repellent in action!  It
      is a useful link as you say, and an
      important aspect.  I thought the two
      sections of chapters that you read to

      3. The W.E.A. visitor's suggestion seems ex-
      cellent - I hope that it works!
      I wish that you could have one of
      the N.G. London University extension
      courses!
      I'm so glad that Molly enjoyed our
      meeting - I thought she did as she
      stayed so long (!) and I enjoyed it too.
      You must ask her over when I am

      Your picture of me cleaning is fairly
      'just! Except that - fearing the billowing
      cloud of dust that you mention - I

      teresting idea - you must try some more
      in their vein. This one is deliciously ev-
      ocative. You too are a Dandy - my
      poet! but a joyous life-accepting one.

      important aspect. I thought the two
      sections of chapters that you read to
