      In Space, are excellent, the best things he has done in any medium, and they
      show up the essentially shop-window character of Raymond Elston''s mobiles.
      Anthony Hill is represented by a single canvas, a tense composition of severe
      strength. Heath''s recent abstractions are conceived more as abstractions than
      his earlier pieces in which his figurative habits lingered. His art is nearer
      now to Pasmore''s statement (June, 1952) that ''Today... abstract are enters
      [or, at least renews] a phase of construction''.<br/>It is understood that the
      group will exhibit at a gallery in London later this year: it will be well worth
      attending this show to see the large works, produced with a maximum energy,
      which are appropriate to a public exhibition.<br/><br/>Lawrence Alloway'
