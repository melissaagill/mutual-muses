      Blackheath 8-4-53
      Tuesday
      Dearest Sylvia,
      Thank you for your letter with good news about your health and the [unclear]soothing [/unclear]information that you are doing some gentle gardening. That sounds charming. How very nice to be out of London. Glad to hear that your Easter was so nice too. I am sure the church looked charming as you decorated it: I should have liked to have seen it. What a fine Easter offering C got: can he have some of it for the personal reconstruction fund? I hope so. I have never known C so full of ideas. Marvellous.
      Today I am going to see the Robert Adams exhibition at Gimpels (for my sculpture article). Then Mrs Onslow-Ford and I are going to see the human head exhibition and, at 5.30, I have my second appointment with the Dentist. I am staying the night at Wimbledon. On Thursday [unclear]John Mett[/unclear] and I are going to draft - 'on spec', only - some art programmes for TV, using his teaching methods.
      Yesterday, after my 2nd Political Prisoners lecture (which was well received) I spent the evening studying the Modern Mex. paintings. I have to represent the Tate Gallery, by the way, at a dinner and lecture given by the Medical Society. W. R. Bett will speak on Van Gogh: artist & addict, and I have to reply from the 'art-side'. No money: nice dinner - possible contacts. I hope I do not have to dress... Nobody else at the TG really [unclear]knows [/unclear]about the medical aspect, I suppose.
      The Trustees, by the way, have acquired a Matisse sculpture - Nude of 30s.
      I quite understand if it is not convenient, but could you possibly advance me a cheque which I could pay back in the next week or so. It is for the rent (you remember Mrs Harrison wanted two months. well, she is back now...). I am waiting for a WEA cheque for, as near as I remember, £23 ,, 11s .,, -D. The rent amounts to £23,,,7s,,6D. The money would only be out of your account for a very short time and I would pay the cheque over top you as soon as it comes.
      Mother tells me Father is financially worried at the moment and Eric cannot manage it. that is why I have to ask you. If you can help you know the money will be safe. If you are able to help do let me have the cheque by Friday's post as Mrs H is impatient.

      [8-4-53] Tuesday Blackheath Dearest Sylvia
      Thank you for your letter with good news about your health and the soothing
      information that you are doing some gentle gardening. That sounds charming.
      How very nice to be out of London. Glad to hear that your Easter was so nice, too.
      I am sure the church looked charming as you decorated it: I should have
      liked to have seen it. What a fine Easter offering C got: can he have some
      of it for the personal reconstruction fund? I hope so. I have never known
      C so full of ideas. Marvellous.

      Today I am going to see the Robert Adams exhibition at Gimples (for my
      sculpture article). Then Mrs Onslow-Ford and I are going to see the human
      head exhibition and, at 5:30, I have my second appointment with the Den-
      tist. I am staying the night at Wimbledon. On Thursday John Mett &
      I are going to draft - 'on spec', only - some art programmes for TV,
      using his teaching methods.

      Yesterday, after my 2nd Political Prisoner Lecture (which was nicely re-
      ceived) I spent the evening studying the Modern Mex. paintings. I have to
      represent the Tate Gallery, by the way, at a dinner and lecture given by the
      Medical Society. W.R. Bett will speak on Van Gogh: Artist & Addict, and I
      have to reply from the 'art-side'. No money: nice dinner - possible con-
      tacts. I hope I do not have to dress... Nobody else at the TG really
      knows about the medical aspect, I suppose.
      The Trusteer, by the way, have acquired or Matisse Sculpure - Nude of 30s.

      I quite understand if it is not convenient, but could you possibly
      advance me a cheque which I could pay back in the next week or so.
      It is for the rent (you remember Mrs Harrison wanted two months. Well,
      she is back now...). I am waiting for a WEA cheque for, as near as
      I remember, 23s 11s. [unclear][/unclear]-D. The rent amounts to 23...7si 6D.
      The money would only be out of your account for a very short time
      and I could pay the cheque over to you as soon as it comes.

      Mother tells me Father is financially worried at the moment & Eric
      cannot manage it. That is why I have to ask you. If you can help you know
      the money will be safe. If you are able to help do let me have the
      cheque by Friday's post as Mrs H. is impatient.
