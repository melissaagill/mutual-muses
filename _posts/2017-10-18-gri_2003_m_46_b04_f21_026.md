      [unclear][/unclear] your class is just ending
      with a discussion - I wonder
      how they enjoyed it - I'm sure
      very much! for I think you
      will make the subject fascinating.
      Do tell me something of it.
      I hope your Tate Lecture goes well.
      While I think of it - do read
      the article on Indian Art in the
      Current 'Listener' it gives a very
      interesting glimpse into Hinduism -
      It sounds rather attractive I must
      say - It also gives Roger Fry
