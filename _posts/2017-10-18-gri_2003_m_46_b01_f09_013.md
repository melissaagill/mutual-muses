      6th October, 1948 11 Mansel Road
      Wimbledon

      Sylvia, my dearest Sylvia. ...I am unsure now how to go
      on. Love betrayed my speech this morning and I fear to
      vex you again. But write I must and there is nothing I
      want to say more than 'I love you'. This morning we crit-
      icised one another. Please believe I was motivated only
      by a desire to ease this anxious suspense. Not by distrust,
      not by distrust. Do remember that passivity is a difficult
      role. O, but your torments, too. My poor Sylvia. My
      precious love.

      I have typed about 4000 words on The Background of The Anal-
      ysis of Beauty today. Is it possible these familiar words
      will one day actually be in print? It seems incredible.
      What a nice day it is. I feel rather a prisoner. Dandy-
      lion wants you to see him at work. Although his Faun In-
      centive is not visible in the sketch she is in his mind's
      eye very vividly.

      I love you very much. It sounds as if you will have a fairly
      busy day today so I hope that you have a sound night's sleep to-
      night as a result. I wish this with all my heart. I hope you
      get to the Wallace alright and I am sure the Philips will do you
      lots of good. I shall think of you. I have got ham for din-
      ner so will not harm. What did you have for lunch in the end?
      Your owls send their love. I explained that I was sending so much
      of mine that there would not be much room but they said it was the
      thought that counted. So rest assured of my love which I swear
      to you is as strong as ever. I love you: I've written those
      words so often but I hope you still feel the unique weight of love
      they carry to you.

      Lawrence

      Sylvia, my dearest Sylvia. ...I am unsure now hot to go on. Love betrayed my speech this morning and I fear to vex you again.  But write I must and there is nothing I want to say more than 'I love you'. This morning we criticised one another. Please believe I was motivated only by a desire to ease this anxious suspense. Not by distrust, not by distrust. Do remember that passivity is a difficult role. O, but your torments, too. My poor Sylvia. My precious love.

      I have typed about 4000 words on The Background of The Analysis of Beauty today. Is it possible these familiar words will one day actually be in print? It seems incredible. What a nice day it is. I feel rather a prisoner. Dandylion wants you to see him at work. Although his Faun Incentive is not visible in the sketch she is in his mind's eye very vividly.

      I love you very much. It seems as if you will have a fairly busy day today so I hope that you have a sound night's sleep tonight as a result. I wish this with all my heart. I hope you get to the Wallace alright and I am sure the Philips will do you lots of good. I shall think of you. I have got ham for dinner so will not harm. What did you have for lunch in the end? Your owls send their love. I explained that I was sending so much of mine that there would not be much room but they said it was the thought that counted. So rest assured of my love which I swear to you is as strong as ever. I love you: I've written those words so often but I hope you still feel the unique weight of love they carry to you.
