      I have 4 [unclear]more lbs[/unclear] of Blackberries
      to get to complete my vintage.

      But I love you, dear one, as always
      and am planning to send various
      pictures to various places - I
      wonder if the Redfern have hung
      my pictures yet.

      Dearest Lawrence I love you so
      much, my poet - tell you your
      Literary News - I saw another
      advertisement of "World Review"
      - Art News - which includes an
      article on "Concert Campetre"
      by my George Jones.

      I suppose you will have the
      Joy of Chester J. soon - he
      sent us the Sacre Coeur too!

      I love you

      Sylvia

      I have 4 morelbs of Blackberries to get to complete my vintage.
      But I love you, dear one, as always and am planning to send various pictures to various places - I wonder if the Redfern have hung my pictures yet.
      Dearest Lawrence I love you so much, my poet - tell you your literary news- I sent another advertisement of "world Review" & Art news - which includes an article on "  Concert Campetre" by my George Jones.
      I suppose you will have the Joy of Charles J . soon - he sent us the Sacre Coeur too!
      I love you
      Sylvia
