      Wimbledon

      2. IX. 1948

      Dearest Sylvia,

      I am delighted that you are
      drawing. I hope the next stage -
      painting - follows soon because
      I know you enjoy that most.

      Of the wretched MacDonald's!
      I hope you have news from them
      soon. Time is running out: it
      is the 2nd already. I long to
      see you again.

      I have my British Museum ticket
      now for books & MSS and yesterday
      I saw Mogarths &c. at the Garrick Club.
      They own a <unclear>Emery</unclear> Dobson. Did you
      know?

      2. IX. 1948

      Dearest Sylvia,
      I am delighted that you are
      drawing. I hope the next stage -
      painting - follows soon because
      I know you enjoy that most.
      Oh the wretched MacDonald's!
      I hope you have news from them
      soon. Time is running out: it
      is the 2nd already. I [unclear]hurry[/unclear] to
      see you again.
      I have my [unclear][/unclear] tiled
      now for books & MSS and yesterday
      I saw [unclear]Mergarths & c.[/unclear] at the Garrick Club.
      They own a [unclear]query Dalson[/unclear]. Did you
      know?

                                         Wimbledon

      2. IX. 1948

      Dearest Sylvia,
            I am delighted that you are
      drawing.  I hope the next stage -
      painting - follows soon because
      I know you enjoy that most.
          Oh the wretched MacDonald's!
      I hope you have news from them
      soon.  Time is running out: it
      is the 2nd already.     I long to
      see you again.
           I have my British Museum [unclear]ticket[/unclear]
      [unclear]now[/unclear] for books & MSS and yesterday
      I saw [unclear]Hogarths[/unclear] &c. at the Garrick Club.
      They own a [unclear]query[/unclear] [unclear]Dobson[/unclear].  Did you
      know?
