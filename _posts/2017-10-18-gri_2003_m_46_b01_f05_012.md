        Your last letter, by the way, and what a nice fat one it was, dated 31st reached me this morning, first post.  The 2nd today.  You said you hoped to catch the afternoon post.  I hope that tells you how long it takes.  Sorry not to have answered your query before but I was unsure at which post they came.

        Oh dear I must stop now as Mother and Berry have come home and with them is a friend of theirs who is coming to tea.  Alas.

        Enclosed is the exam paper which, tell Clifford, I did enjoy.  Michael need have felt no angst about it really...

        I adore you,
        Lawrence.

      Your last letter, by the way, and what a nice fat one it was, dated 31st reached me this morning, first post. It's the 2nd today. You said you hoped to catch the afternoon post. I hope that tells you how long it takes. Sorry not to have answered your query before but I was unsure at which post they came.

      Oh dear I must stop now as Mother and Betty have come and with them is a friend of theirs who is coming to tea. Alas.

      Enclosed is the exam paper which, tell Clifford, I did enjoy. Micheal need have felt no angst about it really...

      I adore you
