      Blackheath
      Sunday
      Dearest Sylvia
      I slept until 11.30, unfortunately, because I must get my Klee contribution ready, fortunately because I was so tired. The Pedagogical Sketchbook is really rather a difficult subject, I am finding.
      It was wonderful seeing you. I agree with you that our difficulties come from not seeing enough of each other. I miss you so much. Soon this obstacle will be removed - if not at one house, then at another. I cannot wait for this, my love.
      Altho' the Richwood house is attractive it is out of town. I do think we should have Darratt's report on the Chepstow Road house before trying for the Richmond one. Low fares, not having to have meals in town, being central, able to go about together; all these add up to a strong case for London W2, I think.
      You mentioned the fare to South Kensington: it would very soon add up, my love. It isn't forever; neither of us wants to live in London forever. We can always sell it and move at a later date. You can have a nice studio and it does fit the kind of life I have to lead owing to my work at the moment.

      [22-11-53] Sunday Blackheath Dearest Sylvia
      I slept until 11:30, unfortunately because I must get my
      Klee contribution ready, fortunately because I was so
      tired. The Pedagogical Sketchbook is really rather
      a difficult subject, I am finding.

      It was wonderful seeing you. I agree with you that
      our difficulties come from not seeing enough of each
      other. I miss you so much. Soon this obstacle will
      be removed - if not at one house, then at another. I
      can not wait for this, my love.

      Altho' the Richword house is attractive, it is out of
      town. I do think we slaved have Danratt's report
      on the Chepstow Road house before trying for the Rich-
      word one. Low fares, not having to have meals in town,
      being central, able to go about together: all these
      add up to a strong case for London W 2, I think.
      You mentioned the fare to South Kensington: it would

      Blackheath
      Sunday

      Dearest Sylvia

      I slept until 11.30, unfortunately because I must get my Klee contribution ready, fortunately because I was so tired. The Pedagogical Sketchbook is really rather a difficult subject, I am finding.

      It was wonderful seeing you. I agree with you that our difficulties come from not seeing enough of each other. I love you so much. Soon this obstacle will be removed - if not at one house, then at another. I cannot wait for this, my love.

      Altho' the Richmond house is attractive it is out of town. I do think we should have [unclear]Barratt's[/unclear] report on the Chepstow Road house before trying for the Richmond one Low fare, not having to have meals in town, being central, able to go about together, all these add up to a strong case for London W2, I think. You mentioned the fare to South Kensington: it would really soon add up, my love. It isn't forever: neither of us wants to live in London forever. We can always sell it & move at a later date. You can have a nice studio and it does fit the kind of life I hope to lead owing to my work at the moment.
