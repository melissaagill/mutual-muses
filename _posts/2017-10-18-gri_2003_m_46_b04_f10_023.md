      surely. You might perhaps (this is only a suggestion) send lion a little drawing
      of it, for your MSS lately have not been ( to Hetty's intense disappointment
      - & to mine) Ill. MSS. A drawing as well as the photograph, that is to say :
      am I not greedy!\nWell, I shall expect you on about Monday fortnight. Time is
      a monster in slow-motion. (If I had found a job yet, I should be very reluctant
      indeed to be parted from you all this time.) On 6th November I am taking part
      in a Quiz or Informal Discussion in Blackheath arranged by the local Arts Society.

      (who is slowly convalescing, delayed a bit by his allergy to the various drugs
      used to keep post-operative pains down); then tea with CS and, if I'm not tired,
      I shall drop in on Paul. Tomorrow (Saturday) is my day of rest and I can stay
      at home. Sunday I am going to Banstead (it'll be like Wednesday) to see Magda.

      Blackheath [19.10.51]
      Friday
      Dearest, my dearest Sylvia
      Your sale of a picture is a great pleasure to me: it has cheered your lion no end as he has been getting over his cold, rather slowly, but, still, surely. You might perhaps (this is only a suggestion) send Lion a little drawing of it, for your MSS lately have not been (to Hetty's intense disappointment - & to mine) Ill. MSS. A drawing as well as the photograph, that is to say: am I not greedy!
      Well, I shall expect you on about Monday fortnight. Time is a monster in slow-motion. (if I found a job yet, I should be very reluctant indeed to be parted from you all this time.) On 6th November I am taking part in a Quiz or Informal Discussion in Blackheath arranged by the local Arts Society. (I fear that awful fat man will be there: if he is I shall be firm, very firm)
      No, don't return Henry VIII until you have finished with it. I have renewed it and will do so again tomorrow. There is no hurry.
      Today I am visiting Father (who is slowly convalescing, delayed a bit by his allergy to the various drugs used to keep post-operative pain down); then tea with CJ and, if I'm not tired, I shall drop in on Paul. Tomorrow (Saturday) is my day of rest and I can stay at home. Sunday I am going to Banstead (it'll be like Wednesday) to see Maga. (By the way, there were 19 people at Banstead last Wednesday.) I have undertaken to get PAPA some detective books: anything so long as it is unreadable, unreal as a crossword puzzle, English, and up-to-date (nothing vieux like Sherlock, for example). Nothing witty, like Chandler.
      I have read at last Bowen on Nostalgia and thought, as you did, that it is not great shakes: not even very well written. Still it does define one aspect of our current failure-of-nerve - as a symptom rather than as an analysis.
