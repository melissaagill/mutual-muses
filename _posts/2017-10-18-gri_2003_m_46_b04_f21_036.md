      [unclear]I had[/unclear] worked just over an hour - and continued with but a
      brief spell until 12 when I had to go back and get the lunch.  I have been working
      on Desiree's portrait but it is not quite satisfactory yet.  I am having rather
      a struggle.  I don't know whether to start another landscape at present the
      weather and the landscape are so varied.  Also I ought perhaps to go my "modells"
      for the mural painters.  I might use for landscape back-ground the view from
      the terrace looking towards the Rose Garden - its the right low eye level.  Did
      you see Paul on Monday last by the way - how is he getting on?  I didn't sleep
      very well last night so thinking of [unclear]ostert[/unclear] I worked out the
      variations on a theme of Fates and so made use of my insomnia! - I must have
      made a slip K. of Aragon is [unclear] Arthurs Death[unclear]- and after she
      is widowed is kept in great poverty by the 2 kings - and is Henrys Cinderella
