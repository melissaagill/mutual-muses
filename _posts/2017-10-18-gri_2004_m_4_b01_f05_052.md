      The Arts Council and Joan Rodgers, John tells me, seems to approve of my employment. 'He has worked out his punishment now,' she said after John told her about St. Albans.  I am furious with her still but it looks as if I may be back in favour soon.

         My project for 'Pictures & Picture Making' has to be approved by [unclear]Gabriel[/unclear] White but I shall get paid whether he accepts it or not, though there is more money if he likes it, of course.

         I have been looking at your self-portrait and I admire it very much.  Though it is not a happy pic-ture it is, I consider, a good one, well-drawn and dar-ingly composed.

         I have notes for several poems scribbled in bus, train, and at home which I am gradually sorting out, so my frustrated afternoon the other day has not lasted.  I should finish The Third Man this week.  I will let you have a copy, of course.

         This morning I have to see about slides for Mon-day's lecture and my next Banstead one (they have got a lantern I'm glad to say):  then, this evening, you may remember, I am seeing Paul.

         I love you, my darling Sylvia, love & adore you

      have notes for several poems scribbled in bus , train,  and at home which I
      am gradually sorting out, so my frustrated afternoon the other day has not lasted.
      I should finish The Third Man this week. I will let you have a copy, of course.<br/>    This
      morning I have to see about slides for Monday''s lecture and my next Banstead
      one (they have got a lantern i''m glad to say) : then, this evening, you may
      remember, I am seeing Paul.<br/>   I love you, my darling Sylvia, love and adore
      you<br/>                                                    Lawrence'

      the Arts Council and Joan Rodgers, John tells me, seems
      to approve of my employment. 'He has worked out his
      punishment now', she said after John told her about St.
      Albans. I am furious with her still but it looks as if
      I may be back in favour soon.

      My project for 'Pictures & Picture Making' has to be
      approved by Gabriel White but I shall get paid whether
      he accepts it or not, though there is more money if he
      likes it, of course.

      I have been looking at your self-portrait and I
      admire it very much. Though it is not a happy pic-
      ture it is, I consider, a good one, well-drawn and dar-
      ingly composed.

      I have notes for several poems scribbled in 'bus,
      train, and at home which I am graduallly sorting out,
      so my frustrated afternoon the other day has not lasted.
      I should finish The Third Man this week. I will let
      you have a copy, of course.

      This morning I have to see about slides for Mon-
      day's lecture and my next Banstead one (they have got
      a lantern I'm glad to say), then, this evening, you may
      rememember, I am seeing Paul.

      I love you, my darling Sylvia, love & adore you

      Lawrence
