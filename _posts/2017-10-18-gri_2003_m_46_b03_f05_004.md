      Blackheath  3 vi 1950
      Dearest Sylvia,

      It is a fine evening and I am sitting by the open window
      with your pictures, as always, giving me pleasure when-
      ever I lift my head, whichever way I look - your nudes,
      your still-lifes, or lion-likenesses.  The birds are,
      to use the word you taught me, creaming.  Your recent
      letters are beside me and my only disappointment is that
      you have not yet sent the second oul-wedding drawing
      that you promised days and days ago.  But, still, the
      one I have is so pretty: I especially admire the dif-
      ference in build and proportion between and male and the
      female owl.  You have exactly caught them.

      Peter Raven was under my arm this morning as I walked to-
      wards the station and met, guess who, Peter Raven.  I
      greeted him, but sternly.  He was clearly a little ab-
      ashed, remembering that he had defaulted.  I entered
      him for The Observer exhibition this morning.

      On Monday I will collect your pictures from the Ken-
      sington Gallery for you said, I see, after re-reading
      your letters, that 5th June was the day set my Mrs Mar-
      chant.  Your lion-manager thinks he has somewhere else
      to show them.  There is to be an exhibition in the foyer
      of a small theatre somewhere, the details of which I
      can get on Tuesday.  If it sounds safe and satis-
      factory perhaps you would not mind lending them?  What
      do you think?  It could do no harm.  In any case there
      is no hurry for a week or two.

      I saw Ceri Richards at the Redfern this morning )Miller
      was not there as far as I could see) and agree with
      you.  The picture in the case outside is a full pastiche
      of HM.  Some of the large pieces are exciting, strong,
      and bold bu there is a rather forced feeling about juxta-
      posing Matisse colour with his own odd figure formulae.

      collect your pictures from the Kensington Gallery for you said, I see, after
      re-reading your letters, that 5th June was the day set by Mrs Marchant. Your
      lion-manager thinks he has somewhere else to show them. There is to be an exhibition
      in the foyer of a small theatre somewhere, the details of which I can get on
      Tuesday. If it sounds safe and satisfactory perhaps you would not mind lending
      them? What do you think? It could do no harm. In any case there is no hurry
      for a week or two.                I saw Ceri Richards at the Redfern this morning
      (Miller was not there as far as I could see) and agree with you. The picture
      in the case outside is a full pastiche of HM. Some of the large pieces are exciting,
      strong, and bold but there is a rather forced feeling about juxtaposing Matisse
      colour with his own odd figure formulae.'

      still-lifes, or lion-likenesses. The birds are,\nto use the word you taught
      me, creaming. Your recent\nletters are beside me and my only disappointment
      is that\nyou have not yet sent the second owl-wedding drawing\nthat you promised
      days and days ago. But, still, the\none I have is so pretty: I especially admire
      the dif-\nference in build and proportion between the male and the \nfemale
      owl. You have exactly caught them.\n\nPeter Raven was under my arm this morning
