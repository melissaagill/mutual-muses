      On a relief Blind Cupid was displayed
      As emblem of the body and its love
      The pendant pictured Cupid with his eyes
      Raised to a mother-substitute alone.
      But the reliefs I annotated thus:
      Blind Cupid is the master of the night
      And [unclear]Codile[/unclear] pleasure, while the uncovered boy
      Has eyes to study flesh - and every [unclear]pasture[/unclear].

      (10)
      A mirror emblem of the rare ideal,
      Reflects three levels of a single love -
      The mouth which formulates the concert,
      That lingers like an exile on a lemon,
      And yet creates sensations of desire;
      And in the crystal surface I regard
      The double image of a perfect love
      That has the beauty of Eylnia and, too,
      Detect my attitude and form.
