      you do not write poetry, and
      vice versa.  If you want to find
      a part time job you might fin
      something at an agency like
      Sybil Rang's of Hampstead; which
      would bring in a few pennies for the
      time being.  There might be something
      in Lewisham or Blackheath perhaps?
      or the West End?
      You will be pleased to hear that
      my lecture went off vey well.
      Sowage was a very cosy reasurring
      chairman!  I did it without
      notes--there was a lively discussion
      mainly centered round Picasso's
      Oct 26.39 portrait of D.M.
      (circulating view point and all that)
      I think I shall be asked to give
      some more lectures!  One on Modern
      art and one to the W.I.!
      i had 38 including 12 children.
      I shall write longer tomorrow
      I must fly off to tea with

      My [unclear][/unclear]--with much love.  I love you. Sylvia

    clean_transcription: You do not write poetry, and vice versa. If you want to find
      a part-time job you might find something at an agency like Sybil Rang's of Hampstead;
      which would bring in a few pennies for the time being. There might be something
      in Lewisham or Blackheath perhaps? or the West End?<br/><br/>You will be pleased
      to hear that my lecture went off very well- Savage was a very cosy reassuring
      chairman! I did it without notes - there was a lively discussion mainly centering
      round Picasso's Oct. 26. '39 portrait of D.M. (cuculating view point and all
      that) I think I shall be asked to give some more lectures! One on modern art
      and one to the W.I.! I had 38 including 12 children. I shall write longer to-morrow.
      I must fly off to tea with Mrs. Hake. With much love.<br/>I love you<br/>Sylvia.<br/><br/>
