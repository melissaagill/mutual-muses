      In the bus.
      Dearest Lawrence -
       have just managed every-thing nicely with one and six to spare. The Giorgione was interesting - the landscape with Paris are possible - the Goddesses are, I imagine repainted - they are very bright and the features not very typical - but I am interested - have made colour notes and ordered a photograph. The one of the Duke of Ferrara is not at all interesting - rather like a Victorian copy! (of a copy) The two Wrights are very interesting - and I am in-clined to think genuine. - I have ordered photographs of them - to encourage us! One is very like "Doredale"- not do good but similar in colour and technique - the other
