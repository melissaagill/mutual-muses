      2. sent a wire saying "Could you send cards immediately" which at last got me a reply in the form of a 'phone call in the early afternoon. He blamed the printer - and I said he could tell him that if he didn't print them at once he might as well not print them at all as there was no point in having a show if it was not properly advertised.He said the gallery didn't send cards until 10 days ahead as a rule - that would be Tuesday I think! And as you remember I often have cards on the very day.

      Please do tell when your Yorkshire lectures are arranged for as I shall stay with my aunt while you are away but would love to be with you while you are in town.

      i am expecting a letter from Chase tomorrow morning, so I will write further tomorrow. I am going in to Hastings tomorrow to get 3 more frames and I'm having Maitland to take me and wait - isn't it luxurious! I am quite well now but taking great care of myself!
