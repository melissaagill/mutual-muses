    annotation_text: While I am on the subject of films (and you know how the subject
      tempts me) I want to refer back to Les Seux Sony Fait which I think we have
      not interpreted quite correctly. It seems that Sartre was not saying that only
      their outside pre-occupation separated the lovers but that (this is part of
      philosophy and not actually present in the film) they were bound to be separated,
      As the heavenly authorities knew, and as the last image so certainly displays.
      In love, Sartre says, one wishes to enter another's being and this he says is
      impossible, since man has no resource outside himself. And since man had to
      be "committed" as the man was in his film was on the side if the proletariat,
      love has no real chance. I don't know if that is clear. If not we shall talk
      about it when we meet. As in another letter about existentialism is so long
      winded, I'm afraid. Still I am determined to know all about it [unclear][/unclear]now
      things [unclear][/unclear]I'm afraid pleasure and surrealism and psychoanalysis
      and aesthetics mean more to me than Sartre's liberty. And I need not tell you
      of my reaction to Sartre's frustrated view of love. A student suggested to me
      in Paris that his view on this subject was conditioned of his own experiences,
      he is short and pudgy. Simone de Beauvoir his mistress, also existentialist,
      is open to the same charge apparently...

      While I am on the subject of films (and you know how the subject tempts me) I want to refer back to the Jeux Sont Fait which I think we have not interpreted quite correctly. It seems that Sartre was not saying that only their outside me - occupations separated them from the lovers but that (this is part of his philosophy and not actually present in the film) they were bound to be separated, as the heavenly authorities knew, and as the last image so certainly displays. In love, Satre says, one wishes to enter another's being and this he says is impossible, since man has no resource outside himself. And since man has to be 'committed', as the man was on the side of the proletariat, love has no real chance. I don't know if that is clear. If no we shall talk about it when we meet. On in another letter [unclear]about[/unclear]existentialism is so long winded, I'm afraid. Still I am determined to know all about now though I'm afraid pleasure and surrealisme and psychoanalysis and aesthetics mean more to me than Sartre's liberty. And I need not tell you of my reaction to Sartre's frustrated view of love. A student suggested to me in Paris Oct his view on this subject was conditioned of his own experiences, he is short and pudgy. Simone de Beauvais his mistress, also existentialist, is open to the same charge apparently ....
