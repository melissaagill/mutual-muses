      Painting 4
      Paul VAlery.
      Surrealism (perhaps because it has been so successfully assimilated into our culture pattern) is no longer a potent force, even in Paris, though the diminished movement still has gifted adherents, such as Victor Braunent. [unclear][/unclear] One could not avoid feeling that the real artistic drive was elsewhere, however - for example, in the 'aformal' painters who were influenced by surrealist automatism. English neo-romanticism (a compound of English nature-romanticism and School of Paris surrealism) is still influential. Graham Sutherland's new paintings had a savage darkness and power that was very impressive after the empty brilliance of his Mediterranean period.
