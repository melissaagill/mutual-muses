      Sylvia, why [strikeout]  are you not here?
      I have been to the Vienna pictures . Only 2 Breugels
      but 19 Titians; including the last nymph and shepherd.
      Also the modern section of Palais d Tokyo: Picasso
      Bonnard, Matisse, a masterpiece by leger 'les Noces', and
      parts of athens, including (for some reason) a room of
      Maurice Et Dennis going to the Vienna show again today
      as it is  only on until 31st march. I saw a film session
      of 'Ruy Blas' (Jean Marais in the double role) script by
      Cocteau. Since I've been here I've been mistaken for an
      American and a Belgan and something else weird was un-
      intelligible. But never English!
        Will write you again tomorrow. Its [strikeout] Thurs
      day morning now. I began this letter last night
        I love you. I miss you.
      At least I have your locket. I feel a poem stirring
      in my subconscious I must cajole it [unclear] ans [/unclear] For you.
