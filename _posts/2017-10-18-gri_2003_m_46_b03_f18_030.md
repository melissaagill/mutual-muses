      Your 'Concert notes' show a preference
      for the Rational attitude of the
      18th I think!  how amusing!
      By the way have you had time to
      do any work on the new
      18th painters for [unclear]So Osbert[/unclear]?  How
      about the Fallacy of Height?

      I am very pleased to hear that
      Paul [unclear]Southey[/unclear] liked my paintings
      so much - it is very flattering.

      I am working on the illustration
      to 'Melpomene', which is I think
      coming well - I hope to finish
      it to-night.  I am getting on wisely
      with the painting of Michael - the
      drawing is not yet as strong as
      I should like but the colour and
      paint quality are pleasing.  I hope
      I shall be able to improve the drawing
      as I go along.

      You seem to be working terribly
      hard, my dearest - I hope you
      are eating well.  I shall look
