      Dearest Lawrence,
      Thank you for your letter and
      the poem which I have read
      twice and like, but I must red
      it again before I can say any-
      thing interesting (!) about it, it
      seems to me very good.  Tiny likes
      it very much too.
      Clifford brought my "Cliff End"
      back today as it is finished.  I
      shall frame it up.  I am very pleased
      with it, I can now put in the
      landscape in RA from it,
      only of course medified, the
      break waters left out.  I shall
      not paint out of doors much next
      week I think, unless I go on
      the shore in the afternoon to
      finish the Cliff End watercolour.
      As I would like to finish the

      the poem which I have read
      twice and like, but I must read
      it again before I can say any-
      thing interesting (!) about it - it

      shall frame it up - I am very pleased
      with it, I can now put in the
      landscape in R. & A. from it -
      only of course modified - the
      break waters left out. I shall
      not paint out of doors much next
      week I think - unless I go on

      finish the Clift End watercolour.

      for your letter and<br/>the poem which I have read<br/>twice and like, but I
      must read<br/>it again before I can say any-<br/>thing interesting (!) about
      it - it<br/>seems to me very good - Tiny likes<br/>it very much too.<br/>Clifford
      brought my "Clift End"<br/>back to-day as it is finished - I<br/>shall frame
      it up - I am very pleased<br/>with it, I can now put in the<br/>landscape in
      R. & A. from it -<br/>only of course modified - the<br/>break waters left out.
      I shall<br/>not paint out of doors much next<br/>week I think - unless I go
      on<br/>the shore in the afternoon to<br/>finish the Clift End watercolour.<br/>As
      I would like to finish the<br/>
