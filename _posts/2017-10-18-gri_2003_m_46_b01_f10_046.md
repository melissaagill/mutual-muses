      21st November 1948  11, Mansel Road, Wimbledon.

      Dearest Sylvia,

      You are always in my mind and heart, vivid, tender, witty, loving, sustaining my great desire for you.  I love you so much and wish for our being to gether so strongly:

      Ardent for your presence
      In the house of love
      I ruefully distract
      Myself with pleasantries,
      Attend an archers' match
      In a green alley -
      But find the arrows are
      Directed at my heart;
      Observe the lore of clouds
      But draw no consolation
      From the seraphic show -
      As downy as a bed.
      These and every other thing
      Are symbols of my love.

      This morning I finished another chapter - it has taken less than a week - so you see I am working for our Italian visit.  The thought of you inspires me even as it rouses a desire not to be satisfied until the new year.  I do little but write, either to you, or about you, or for you (Hogarth).  Have no doubts for the future: my dowry is not only three-penny pieces, it is love and care.

      You are beautiful my dearest: memory places you in a landscape of wishing wells and mirrors.  The wells will satisfy only one wish.  But the mirrors compete for the most delightful image of you: all images are different yet equally lovely.  But nothing can replace, for me, the exquisite immediacy of being with you.  I long for you.

      Thank you for your letter, it made my happy.  Write soon please.  You have not been unwell with your cold have you?  It is a fine day today: I hope you take a pleasant walk.

      The Muses were challenged by nine mortal girls to a singing match: the challengers were defeated and turned into magpies.  This poem may seem arrogant, turning other poets into magpies, but because they lack the privilege of your inspiration:

      Let all the rest be magpies -
      Gawky in the sky, or in the orchard
      Peck unripe banks of fruit,
      Jump, neurotic, at the scarecrow critic -

      So I, like Muses, banish
      Competitors in song, for you possess
      My poems like a wind the flag,
      And lend them grace and wit, your merit theirs.

      \nYou are always in my mind and heart, vivid, tender, witty, loving, sustaining

      so strongly:\nArdent for your presence \nIn the house of love\nI ruefully distract\nMyself
      with pleasantries, \nAttend an archers' match \nIn a green alley - \nBut find
      the arrows are \nDirected at my heart; \nObserve the lore of clouds\nBut draw
      no consolation\nFrom the seraphic show - \nAs downy as a bed. \nThese and every
      other thing\nAre symbols of my love. \nThis morning I finished another chapter
      - it has taken less than a week - so you see I am working for our Italian visit.
      \ The thought of your inspires me even as it rouses a desire not to be satisfied
      until the new year.  I do little but write, either to you, or, about you, or
      for you (Hogarth).  Have no doubts for the future: my dowry is not only three-penny
      pieces, it is love and care. \nYou are beautiful my dearest: memory places you
      in a landscape of wishing wells and mirrors.  The wells will satisfy only one
      wish. But the mirrors compete for the most delightful image of you: all images
      are different yet equally lovely.  But nothing can replace, for me, the exquisite
      immediacy of being with you.  I long for you. \nThank you for your letter, it

      21st November 1948  11, Mansel Road, Wimbledon.

      Dearest Sylvia,

      You are always in my mind and heart, vivid, tender, witty, loving, sustaining my great desire for you. I love you so much and wish for our being together so strongly:

      Ardent for your presence
      In the house of love
      I ruefully distract
      Myself with pleasantries,
      Attend an archers' match
      In a green alley -
      But find the arrows are
      Directed at my heart;
      Observe the lore of the clouds
      But draw no consolation
      From the seraphic show -
      As downy as a bed.
      These and every other thing
      Are symbols of my love.

      This morning I finished another chapter - it has taken less than a week - so you see I am working for our Italian visit. The thought of you inspires me even as it rouses a desire not to be satisfied until the new year. I do little but write, either to you, or, about you, or for you (Hogarth). Have no doubts for the future: my dowry is not only three-penny pieces, it is love and care.

      You are beautiful my dearest: memory places you in a landscape of wishing wells and mirrors. The wells will satisfy only one wish. But the mirrors compete for the most delightful image of you: all images are different yet equally lovely. But nothing can replace, for me, the exquisite immediacy of being with you. I long for you.

      Thank you for your letter, it made me happy. Write soon please. You have not been unwell with your cold have you? It is a fine day today: I hope you take a pleasant walk.

      The Muses were challenged by nine mortal girls to a singing match: the challengers were defeated and turned into magpies. This poem may seem arrogant, turning other poets into magpies, but only because they lack the privilege of your inspiration:

      Let all the rest be magpies -
      Gawky in the sky, or in the orchard
      Peck unripe banks of fruit,
      Jump, neurotic, at the scarecrow critic -

      So, I, like Muses, banish
      Competitors in song, for you possess
      My poems like a wind the flag,
      And lend them grace and wit, your merit theirs.
