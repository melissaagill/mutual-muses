      LONDON NATIONAL GALLERY
      25 V 1950
      Dearest Sylvia
      This letter must be fairly hurried I'm afraid - i am in Charles' ofice at the N.G. He wants me to take Friday's [unclear]pullie[/unclear] lecture so I have to do a little preparation. The subject is Italian masterpieces IV - & work after masterpieces have been used up in the preceeding three talks.
      Is not the weather nice! However, there is a bright aspect of it - for once a rainy day when I have NOT just been to [unclear] Carsons[/unclear]. I think I must wait until after Ehitman Poor Clifford is [unclear][/unclear] - I'm afraid the holiday at Brighton will be sadly interferred with by the [unclear][/unclear] weather which is a shame.
      I have some poems in progress - a longish one and the topographical piece, as well as T6 Poet in the [unclear]gander[/unclear]. It is too early to send you any yet but i hope to work on them in bed this evening after the AIA committee meeting - of which I will send you news.
      But now I must prepare my lecture - then I shall not need to come to town until after lunch which will be a good thing.
      Look, my sweetest cat, after yourself, my beauty - I think of you all the time - and miss you
      I love you

      LONDON  NATIONAL GALLERY  25 V 1950
      Dearest Sylvia,
      This letter must be fairly hurried I'm afraid not more than a note.  I am
      in Charles' office at the N.G.  He wants me to take Fri-
      day's public lecture so I have to do a little preparation.
      The subject is Italian masterpieces IV - and most of the master-
      pieces have been used up in the preceding three talks.
      Is not the weather vile!  However, there is a bright as-
      pect of it - for once a rainy day when I have NOT just
      been to [unclear]Carsons[/unclear].  I think I must wait until after Whitsun.
      Poor Clifford and Marjorie - I'm afraid their holiday at Brighton
      will be sadly interfered with by the [unclear]inetdar[/unclear] weather what
      a shame.
      I have some poems in progress - a longish one, and the topo
      graphical piece, as well as The Poet in the Garden.  It is too
      early to send you any yet but I hope to work on them in bed
      this evening after the AIA committee meeting - of which I
      will send you news.
      But now I must prepare my lecture - then, I shall not need to
      come to town until after lunch which will be a good thing.
      Look, my sweetest cat, after yourself, my beauty - I think
      of you all the time - and miss you.
      I love you
      Lawrence

      Charles' office at the N.G.  He wants me to take Fri-<br/>day's public lecture
      so I have to do a little preparation.<br/>The subject is Italian masterpieces
      IV - and most of the master-<br/>pieces have been used up in the preceding three
      talks.<br/>Is not the weather vile!  However, there is a bright as-<br/>pect
      of it - for once a rainy day when I have NOT just<br/>been to Carsons.  I think
      I must wait until after Whitsun.<br/>Poor Clifford and Marjorie - I'm afraid
      their holiday at Brighton<br/>will be sadly interfered with by the inetdar weather
      what<br/>a shame.<br/>I have some poems in progress - a longish one, and the
      topo<br/>graphical piece, as well as The Poet in the Garden.  It is too<br/>early
      to send you any yet but I hope to work on them in bed<br/>this evening after
      the AIA committee meeting - of which I<br/>will send you news.<br/>But now I
      must prepare my lecture - then, I shall not need to<br/>come to town until after
      lunch which will be a good thing.<br/>Look, my sweetest cat, after yourself,
      my beauty - I think<br/>of you all the time - and miss you.<br/>I love you<br/>Lawrence
