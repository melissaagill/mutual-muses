Andre Breton and Alexander Pope are my witnesses!  My rare my dazzling beauty your magic involves me in a net of glittering memories and anticipation of you.

      Dearest Sylvia, my love
      This is a short note to say about this morning's letter did not say enough - that I adore you, that my pleasure in loving you and being loved is so great.
      Ravishing creature I think of you all the while. As I worked this afternoon you were always in my thoughts - as I glimpsed a picture by you - as I reached for a book - or as the light, now fading, caught my ring.
      I feel less worried for I have made admirable notes for [unclear] Edmarrow's [/unclear] Impressionist lecture which I shall tell you bits of (proudly) soon when we meet.
      Oh I am deliciously haunted by you, disturbingly and ravishingly aware of you, despite absence or existentialist geography; you are my muse and my love.  Andre' Breton and Alexander Pope are my witnesses!  My rare my dazzling beauty your magic [unclear] involves [/unclear] me in a net of glittering memories and anticipations of you.
      Alas, more work to do, but this letter shall catch the last-but-one post and so I hope reach you before Sunday - that day without postmen, that landscape without messengers.
