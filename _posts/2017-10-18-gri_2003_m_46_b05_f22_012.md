      for lunch in Hastings - or rather
      Addison's St Leopards which
      is respectable and not too ex-
      pensive I believe!
      Clifford is going to town
      on Thursday morning by the
      10:10 to C.X. so I shall
      travel with him - arriving at
      about 12:15 I think - do not
      meet me, you will be too busy.
      I will dump my suitcase and
      come straight to the Tate Gallery.
      I shall know where to find you
      by the Title of your lecture!
      If this doesn't meet with your
      approval, let me know! But
      I think its a good idea for
      we can then have Friday in
      Peace together! I shall paint
      Alison on Saturday.
      I adore you
      I love you
      Sylvia
