      your idea--but it sounds rather evangelical. However, perhaps you are right.

      I have looked for your chapter, no luck so far--but I will look more thoroughly to-morrow.To-day we are going to Canterbury--I have had no time for painting, I fear.

      I am so glad that your N.A. lecture was so successful. I hope your Saturday one is as successful--or better even! I am glad you have more from [unclear]Miss Chiek[/unclear].

      I am so glad that the [unclear]Caruarion[/unclear] is doing well. I hope the family part was pleasant, poor Hetty what [unclear]agreed[/unclear] wash up! With Dandy working on a lecture too!

      I love you, dearest one

    clean_transcription: Your idea- but it sounds rather<br/>evangelical - However
      perhaps<br/>you are right. <br/>I have looked for your chapter,<br/>no luck
      so far - but I will <br/>look more thoroughly to-morrow.<br/>To-day we are going
      to Canter-<br/>bury - I have had no time <br/>for painting I fear.<br/>I am
      so glad that your <br/>H. G. lecture was so successful<br/>I hope your Saturday
      one is<br/>as successful - or better even!<br/>I am glad you have more<br/>from
      this Chief<br/>I am so glad that the<br/>Carnation is doing well. <br/>I hope
      the family party was<br/>pleasant - poor Hetty what<br/>a great work up! with
      Dandry<br/>working for a lecture too!<br/>I love you, dearest one - <br/>I love
      you<br/>Sylvia
