      THE NATIONAL GALLERY

      LONDON WC 2

      15 July 1952
      Dearest Sylvia,
      My cheques have not yet come
      but I have requested Mr. Parsons
      to let me have June payments
      immediately.  Therefore I think
      you should not come before
      Thursday:  possibly Friday
      would be more certain as I
      am confident of having plenty
      of food and money by then.
      However I will meet you on
      Thursday if you say so, when
      and where you suggest in any
      letter:  even if I cannot confirm
      it in time be sure I shall meet
