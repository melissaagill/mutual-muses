      A Garden for Sylvia & Lawrence

      Caryatides support
      A green summerhouse
      In a garden where Desire and Time
      Graft lovers like a splendid rose

      The garden is an album
      Whose pages Summer turns
      To show ourselves reflected
      Endlessly in a pool

      However deep we drink
      The pool is constantly renewed
      And mirrors the design
      Of lovers on the bank

      Think of such lovers in
      A green and silver vista.
      Fruit palpably expand.
      A world, a summerhouse...

      I must try and write a poem about the wall you paint with such success.

      I am dying to see you.  I love you, my dearest one, I love you,

      Lawrence

      Think of such lovers in
      A green and silver vista.
      Fruit palpably expand.
      A world, a summerhouse . . .

      I must try and write a poem about the
      wall you paint with such success.

      I am dying to see you. I love you,
      my dearest one, I love you,
