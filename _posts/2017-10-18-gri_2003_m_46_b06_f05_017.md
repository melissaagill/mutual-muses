      P.S. Congratulations about Rye artists. What views are you going to paint, I wonder....
      -------------------------------------------------------------------------
      [unclear]explain,[/unclear] I now have the perfect use for the phrase 'Look Ma No Hands': obviously - caryatids. Hands, of course, fit into my general anatomy lesson of the present phase.
      [unclear]Nell[/unclear] has given me a drawing - framed! A new free bold [unclear]autocratic[/unclear] pen-drawing. She read some of my poetry - likes several poems & suggests an editor to send it to...
      I love you very much. The cuckoo which always reminds me of you (remember the garden at Pett) has been silent since you left. Did you take it with you? I have been thinking of you even without the bird's song - I love you, dearest Sylvia, I love you.
      Today I must see the [unclear]Manze[/unclear] exhibition for tomorrow's Tate lecture (Mod. Itals).
      I love you I love you

      PS Congratulations about Rye artists. What views are
      you going to paint, I wonder...

      [unclear][/unclear], I now have the perfect use for the phrase 'Look
      Ma No Hands': obviously - caryatids: Hands, of course,
      fit into my general anatomy lesson of the present phase.

      Ithell has given me a drawing - framed! A very full,
      bold, automatic pen-drawing. She read some of
      my poetry - like several poems & suggests an ed-
      itor to send it to...

      I love you very much. The cuckoo which always
      reminds me of you (remember the garden at Pett)
      has been silent since you left. Did you take it
      with you? I have been thinking of you even without
      the bird's song. I love you, dearest Sylvia, I
      love you.

      Today I must see the [unclear][/unclear] exhibition for to-
      morrow's Tate Lecture ([unclear][/unclear])

      I love you, love you
