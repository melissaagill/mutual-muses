      I still have a little work to do on it.
      Thank goodness for the Architectural Review!
      for I have very few slides indeed.

      Christies will see your Young Man at
      any time. Mr Leger's movements are vague
      but you could leave the picture
      or, perhaps, ring up again on Monday
      morning. Sorry it is not more settled.

      Both the Leicerts & Kensington
      Gals have been engaged for the
      part 25 minutes so I will ring
      a little later & let you know
      what I can arrange.
      I love you
