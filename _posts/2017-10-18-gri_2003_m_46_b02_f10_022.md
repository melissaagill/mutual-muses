      ODE ON A RING OF MINERVA

      Upon my hand an oval,
      Incised with patriotic features
      Of an island varient
      Of the Goddess for whom I sacrifice
      (In respect of her early form)

      The fear of death and that of solitude,
      All mal-formed sharp regressions:
      As patron of maturity she holds
      Her place upon my left hand
      Though equally important in my right,

      For both hands have held her flesh
      And opened the body's books and written
      Sestinas, odes, and sonnets
      On her good-will, beauty, and intelligence,
      On her emblem and her self.

      Minerva, red, upon my hand,
      You saw to the past's exit,
      And were the hand that locked the back door,
      And are the present hand
      Laying the table for happiness.

      The secret sign of pleasure
      Made by the fingers or the gestures
      Of the male expressive hand
      In erotic search or action gains
      From 'Britannia's' guiding head.

      Your emblem is the present on my hand.
