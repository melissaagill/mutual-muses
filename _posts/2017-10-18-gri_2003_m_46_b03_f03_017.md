      Blue highlights in a flint
      And mirrorevading favours
      Of a dual mood

      Heroic reminiscences of sculpture
      Whisper allusively
      Rhetoric has its state and its authority
      Soft, in the yielding cage of dawn

      The latter, you will see, is a 'duel' statement of rhetoric, which
      I ironically defended and the less 'official' attitude which you
      maintained.  Both-and, of courses, is my out.

      Paul read some of my poems and liked them, especially some of the
      Still-lifes.

      Thinking of Paul reminds me that he has some gossip.  Ricky has
      not painted a thing for weeks and Molly has been afflicted with
      boredom (the enemy is ennui).

      I met Klingender yesterday and we had a pleasant talk.  I shall
      see him again at Madeleine Pearson's party.  We disagreed, pol-
      itely but firmly, about the French abstractionists included in
      the London-Paris show at the New Burlington.  It's all a great
      bore, English and French alike.

      Oh dear the time is 12:15 and soon I must go to the N.G. for a
      lecture to the photographers.  I think its the last one, I hope
      it is.  I may go on to the V and A for some slides for the last
      Banstead lecture tomorrow.  I have so many things to be doing I
      feel a bit paralysed: Joyce, Hogarth, pictures for Miss Chick,
      letters, lectures, lantern slides, and I want to do some more to
      our play, but how, when?  I will try.

      Tell Tiny I have a Sewanee subscription for the coming year al-
      ready but that I shall be delighted to lend each issue to her as
      it appears.  Does she want some more yet?

      I am looking forward to Easter with you.  I shall get lots of
      chocolate eggs.  And I believe I can now cook omelettes: this
      will be a new distraction for you.

      I think of you all the time and, now and again, with a shade of
      apprehension for every time you come to let the flat there seems
      to be a crisis.  I hope it can be avoided this time.  For, my
      dove, your sake, as well as our double sake.  I love you and long
      to be splashed a bit with your paint again as sometimes happens.
      Particularly with red.  I love you I love you I love you I love you

      my cut.<br/>Paul read some of my poems and liked them, especially some of the
      Still-lifes.<br/>Thinking of Paul reminded me that he has some gossip. Ricky
      has not painted a thing for weeks and Molly has been afflicted with boredom
      (the enemy is ennui).<br/>I met Klingender yesterday and  we had a pleasant
      talk. I shall see him again at Madeleine Pearson''s party. We disagreed, politely
      but firmly, about the French abstractionists included in the London-Paris show
      at the New Burlington. It''s all a great bore, English and French alike.<br/>On
      dear the time is 12.45 and soon I must go to the N.G. [National Gallery] for
      a lecture to the photographers. I think its the last one, I hope it is. I may
      go on to the V and A [Victoria and Albert] for some slides for the last Banstead
      lecture tomorrow. I have so many things to be doing I feel a bit paralysed:
      Joyce, Hogarth, pictures for Miss Chick, letters, lectures, lantern slides,
      and I want to do some more to our play, but how, when? I will try.<br/>Tell
      Tiny I have a Sewanee subscription for the coming year already but that I shall
      be delighted to lend each issue to her as it appears. Does she want some more
      yet?<br/>I am looking forward to Easter with you. I shall get lots of chocolate
      eggs. And I believe I can now cook omlettes: this will be a new distraction
      for you.<br/>I think of you all the time and, now and again, with a shade of
      apprehension for every time you come to let the flat there seems to be a crisis.
      I hope it can be avoided this time. For, my dove, your sake, as well as our
      double sake. I love you and long to be splashed a bit with your paint again
      as sometimes happens. Particularly with red. I love you I love you I love you
      I love you<br/>Lawrence'
