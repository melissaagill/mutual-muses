      Dear Love, dearest Lawrence,  I have felt very melancholy all day - which is in part due to the date.  I have felt tired and weak  - but now having had a lovely hot bath I feel more cheerful and less despondent.  I love you so much.  I must work very hard on my painting this week, starting tomorrow.  Then I shall, I hope have finished it before Sunday week and be able to come up as I said with Clifford on Monday.  Perhaps you can meet us at the station.  It would be great fun if we could have lunch together.  Then we could go to the Tate Gallery if you should need to.  Then to Blackheath!  Until Wednesday when I expect my people will move out.

      Dear Love, dearest Lawrence,
      I have felt very melancholy
      all day--which is in part
      due to the date.  I have felt
      tired and weak--but now having
      had a lovely hot bath I feel
      more cheerful and less despondent.
      I love you so much.  I must
      work very hard on my paint-
      ing this week, starting to-
      morrow.  Then I shall, I hope
      have finished it before Sunday
      week and be able to
      come up as I said with Clifford
      on Monday.  Perhaps you can
      meet us at the station.  It
      would be great fun if we could

      if you should need to.  Then
      to Blackheath!  Until Wednesday
