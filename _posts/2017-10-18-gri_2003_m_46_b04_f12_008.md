      4 December 1951
      My dearest Sylvia -
      I am very sad that you should be so anxious. It is true your latest letters are more cheerful, but you must not worry so much. I know what the trouble is - you are living alone: I remember a magazine headline once, beside a photograph of a beautiful girl: "She lives alone & loathes it." I fear you may find my [unclear]rationalism[/unclear] & optimism superficial but I do think you exaggerate. Once I have succeeded in getting a job things will be much easier - or, perhaps in your present mood you fear this is the equivalent of Billy Bunter's postal-order. I assure you I feel very seriously about the matter: you are not the only one who cannot sleep. I can only sleep when I am tired out - otherwise I am fearfully restless & wakeful. When we meet I am sure you will feel better - I know I shall. I did not receive your letter until I returned in the evening to Blackheath & I could not even then put the light out until I had written the following poem:
