      III LYRIC
      The princess is coming
      From the edge of the sea

      The wind from the sea
      Stirs the feathers of swans

      The wind fells the apples
      The wind fills the basket

      my love is coming inland
      The wind deserts the sea

      IV EPIGRAM
      I'm avalanched by memories of you
      But rich and precious as they are
      I die to meet you that we both may die
      And I shall have no time for memories

      You know the theory about ideal beauty being achieved by a selection or re-arrangement of natural beauties. This I regret because of the wonder I have at your personal beauty, my darling.

      V
      If beauty were a composite
      Of numerous heroines
      An essence, an idea, a ghost,

      Who is the body under me
      Superbly individual
      Unique she is, unique my love,

      III LYRIC

      The princess is coming
      From the edge of the sea

      The wind from the sea
      Stirs the feathers of swans

      The wind [unclear]fells[/unclear] the apples
      The wind fills the basket

      My love is coming inland
      The wind deserts the sea

      IV EPIGRAM

      Im avalanched by memories of you
      But rich and precious as they are
      I die to meet you that we both may die
      And I shall have no time for memories.

      You know the theory about ideal heaven being achieved by a selection on rearrangement of natural beauties. This I reject because of the wonder I have at your personal beauty, my darling.

      V
      If beauty were a composite
      Of numerous heroines
      An essence, an Idea, a ghost,
      The Face that [unclear]Jare[/unclear] wish to be

      Who is the body under me
      Superbly individual
      Unique she is, unique my love
