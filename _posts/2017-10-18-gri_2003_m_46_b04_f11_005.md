      25th November 1951
      Dearest Sylvia,
      How can i thank you enough for Les Cheveux d'Hetty. It is enchanting and superb. If I were a monarch the postman who brought this illuminated manuscript without bending it would be knighted. Oh it is beautiful: it is beside me on the table as I write. The drawing and colour of the images is delightful and so, so is the poem. (It is a very subtle compliment to Hetty that you have used French words she knew.)  The music and the verbal images are lovely. This picture-poem is now one of my most treasured possessions.
      I am glad to hear that you have found suitable frames for your still-life triptych and some others, too. And I am made very happy by the news that you have bought a Worcester Cup and saucer for your Hetty. When she uses it you will see her raising her tri-colour veils (in honour of your French poem) to sip tea from it.
      Was the Dentist too clumsy? I hope that this time he was gentle and did not hurt you.
      One of the applicants for the Tate jobs is Ronald Alley (spelling?) whom I met at the T.G. when he was temporarily doing the Assistant Keeper job there. So I think he may have a good chance of getting the post permanently. However, you never know and we shall see (as people are always saying).
