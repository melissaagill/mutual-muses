      \  I love you: how much yesterday's meeting meant to me. We were together for
      about eight hours. Not long perhaps, but love made so much of it. I am swept
      off my feet with delight when we meet and time means very little. You are beautiful,
      much too beautiful to wast time in anxiety. Be assured about the future as you
      are of my love: once you doubted that at times but you do not now. Soon I will
      banish this doubt as I did for the other - simply by loving you. You have done
      so much for me: banished wrecks from the map leaving only winds and mermaids.
      I will only your pleasure: that is my motive for writing. My rose, my Minerva,
      my cat.\n\nI looked at your painting in the train for a long time and was very
      happy and I have been looking at it in this morning's rather murky daylight.
      The tints of the leaves are exquisite and I adore the way in which they grow
      in different directions, some inwards, some outwards, never flatly. It is a
      daring composition - a kind of pictorial equivalent to Mallarme's poems about
      roses. It is at once precise and trembling with life. i adore it and adore you
      for letting me have it. I return to your pictures so often, dearest Sylvia.\n\nLast
      night I caught the 7.5 train at 7.30 and we got into Victoria at about 10.15
      so that was not at all bad really. I did not reach home till about 11.30, however,
      as the fog was worse in town than elsewhere. I had a hot drink and went to bed
      then. I hope you did not get cold at Battle and that you changed your socks
      as soon as you got to Pett. Today it is worse than ever. I hope my schools come
      tomorrow to the N.G. Pablo has just come in and he is purring thunderously with
      pleasure at the heat of the fire. \n\nI enjoyed Battle very much, it is an odd
      and lyrical experience. This poem does not do justice to it but was written
      in the train and I send it to you anyhow:\n\nHere brown benedictines constructed
      an abbey\nAnd herbs grow on the ledge of a lancet window.\n\nThe towers at the
      end of the terrace and unencumbered\nBy facts of structure, roots, the enemy
      of flight.\n\nThe mist makes cool abstractions of the landscape.\nWe live in

      1st December 1948

      Dearest Sylvia,

      I love you:  how much yesterday's meeting meant to me.  We were together for about eight hours.  Not long perhaps, but love made so much of it.  I am swept off my feet with delight when we meet and time means very little.  You are beautiful, much too beautiful to waste time in anxiety.  Be assured about the future as you are of my love:  once you doubted that at times but you do not now.  Soon I wil banish this doubt as I did the other - simply by lving you.  You have done so much for me:  banished wrecks from the map leaving only winds and mermaids.  I will only your pleasure:  that is my motive for writing.  My rose, my Minerva, my cat.

      I looked at your painting in the train for a long time and was very happy and I have been looking at it in this morning's rather murky daylight.  The tints of the leaves are exquisite and I adore the way in which they grown in different directions, some inwards, some outwards, neaver flatly.  It is a daring composition - a kind of picorial equivalent o Mallarme's pomes about roses.  It is at once precise and trembling with life.  I adore it and adore you for leeting me have it.  I return to your pictures so often, dearest Sylvia.

      Last night I caught the T.5 train at 7.20 and we got into Victoria at about 10.15 so that was not at all bad really.  I did not reach home till about 11.30, however, as the fog was worse in town than elsewhere.  I had a hot drink and went to bed then.  I hope you did not get cold at Battle and that you changed your socks as soon as you go to Pett.  Today it is worse than ever.  I hope my schools come tomorrow to the N.G.  Pablo has just come in and he is purring thunderoulsly with pleasure at the heat of the fire.

      I enjoyed Battle very much, it was an odd and lyrical experience.  This poem does not do justice to it but itwas written in the train and I send it to you anyhow:

      Here brown benedictines constructed an abbey
      And herbs grown on the ledge of a lancet window.

      The mist makes cool abstractions of the landscape.
      We live in a world of foregrounds, my companion.
      The towers at the end of the terrane are unemcumbered
      By facts of structure, roots, the enemy of flight.
      Figures in a sublime engraving, we wander
      Resurgant grass in an early english hall.

      1st December 1948 11 Mansel Road Wimbledon

      Dearest Sylvia,

      I love you: how much yesterday's meeting meant to me.
      We were together for about eight hours. Not long perhaps,
      but love made so much of it. I am swept off my feet with
      delight when we meet and time means very little. You are
      beautiful, much too beautiful to waste time in anxiety.
      Be assured about the future as you are of my love: once
      you doubted that at times but you do not now. Soon I
      will banish this doubt as I did the other - simply by lov-
      ing you. You have done so much for me: banished wrecks
      from the map leaving only winds and mermaids. I will
      only your pleasure: that is my motive for writing. My
      rose, my Minerva, my cat.

      I looked at your painting in the train for a long time
      and was very happy and I have been looking at it in this
      morning's rather murky daylight. The tints of the leaves
      are exquisite and I adore the way in which they grow in dif-
      ferent directions, some inwards, some outwards, never flatly.
      It is a darling composition - a kind of pictorial equivalent
      to Mallarme's poems about roses. It is at once precise and
      trembling with life. I adore it and adore you for letting
      me have it. I return to your pictures so often, dearest
      Sylvia.

      Last night I caught the 7.5 train at 7.30 and we got into
      Victoria at about 10.15 so that was not at all bad really.
      I did not reach home till about 11.30, however, as the fog
      was worse in town than elsewhere. I had a hot drink and
      went to bed then. I hope you did not get cold at Battle
      and that you changed your socks as soon as you get to Pett.
      Today it is worse than ever. I hope my schools come to-
      morrow to the N.G. Pablo has just come in and he is purr-
      ing thunderously with pleasure at the heat of the fire.

      I enjoyed Battle very much, it was an odd and lyrical
      experience. This poem does not do justice to it but it was
      written in the train and I send it to you anyhow:

      Here brown benedictines constructed an abbey
      And herbs grow on the ledge of a lancet window.

      The towers at the end of the terrace are unencumbered
      By facts of structure, roots, the enemy of flight.

      The mist makes cool abstractions of the landscape.
      We live in a world of foregrounds, my companion.

      Figures in a sublime engraving, we wander
      Resurgent grass in an early english hall.
