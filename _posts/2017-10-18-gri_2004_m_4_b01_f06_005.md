      Blackheath  2 ix 1949

      Dearest Sylvia,

      Your letter is rather confusing about the lec-
      tures.  Thank you for offering to take one of the
      engagements if I should be busy (I adore you for
      thinking of that) but I hope it will not be necess-
      ary.

      I have accepted Hammersmith.  Do I take your
      letter to mean that we should each do a course -
      I at St. Albans and you at Hammersmith?  If you
      think this is a good idea I will ask John Skipp.
      I am not sure that our finances would compel you
      to do that, though, and guide-lecturing is a bore.
      Tell me more clearly what you mean.  I'm sorry to
      be so dense.

      Your suggestions about reviewing are all congen-
      ial to me but not many books are sent to Art News
      and Review, at present, and certainly neither of
      those you mention have gone to Gainsborough.  I
      wish they had.  The publishers have not accepted
      the paper wholeheartedly yet, you see.

      What very good news about your cliff painting.
      I am glad St. Nicholas is being so useful.  You sh-
      ould have some more news of it soon - I look for-
      ward to your next letter describing your progress.
      Here is a poem - quite a slight one, I admit - about
      it:

      Today when the clouds are exact
      Like Rene Magritte weather
      I think of you my loving
      Double and double-dealer
      At the game of likeness
      On the shore where formerly
      I was your foreground figure
