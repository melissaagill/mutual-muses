      WIMbledon 1967

      11 MANSEL ROAD,
      WIMBLEDON

      Sunday Evening

      My dearest Sylvia,

      I have been noting down one or two references to roses I have come across in poetry I have read and I thought you might like to see them.

      1. O my Luve's like a red, red rose
      That's newly sprung in June.

      2. The blude red rose at Yule may blow
      The simmer-lillies bloom in snow,
      The frost may freeze the deepest sea,
      But an auld man shall never daunton me.

      Those are by Burns. The next by Wallace Stevens (nice - president of the Hartford Assurance Company or something like that):

      3. Compare the silent rose of the sun
      And rain, the blood-rose living in its smell,
      With this paper, this dust...
      [unclear]IC[/unclear] is an artificial world. The rose of paper is of the nature of its world.

      Paul Edward in Blason des Fleurs et Des Fruits says

      4. Rose pareille au parricide

      Charles Henry Ford:

      5.  A cold wind blew in the ear of the rose;
      the rose complained soundlessly, like a bird drinking.

      [7-6-48]
      11 Mansel Road, Wimbledon.
      WIMbledon 1967
      Sunday Evening

      My dearest Sylvia,
      I have been noting down one or two references to roses I have come across in poetry I have read and I thought you might like to see them.
      1) O my Luve's like a red, red rose
      That's newly sprung in June
      2) The blude red rose at Yule may blaw
      The simmer-lillies bloom in snaw,
      The frost may freeze the deepest sea,
      But an auld man shall never daunton me.
      Those are by Burns. The next by Wallace Stevens (vice-president of the Hartford Assistance Company or something like that):
      3) Compare the silent rose of the sun And rain, the blood-rose living in its smell, with this paper, this dust... It is an artificial world. The rose of paper is of the nature of its world.
      Paul Eluard in Blason des Fleurs et Des Fruits says
      4) Rose pareille au parricide
      Charles Henri Ford:
      5) A cold wind blew in the ear of the rose; the rose complained soundlessly, like a bird drinking.

      Evening<br/><br/>My dearest Sylvia,<br/>I have been noting down one or two references
      to roses I have come across in poetry I have read and I thought you might like
      to see them.<br/>1) O my Luve''s like a red, red rose<br/>That''s newly sprung
      in June<br/>2) The blude red rose at Yule may blaw<br/>The simmer-lillies bloom
      in snaw,<br/>The frost may freeze the deepest sea,<br/>But an auld man shall
      never daunton me.<br/>Those are by Burns. The next by Wallace Stevens (vice-president
      of the Hartford Assistance Company or something like that):<br/>3) Compare the
      silent rose of the sun And rain, the blood-rose living in its smell, with this
      paper, this dust... It is an artificial world. The rose of paper is of the nature
      of its world.<br/>Paul Eluard in Blason des Fleurs et Des Fruits says<br/>4)
      Rose pareille au parricide<br/>Charles Henri Ford:<br/>5) A cold wind blew in
      the ear of the rose; the rose complained soundlessly, like a bird drinking.'
