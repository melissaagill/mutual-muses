      II
      On Saturday evening, after I had just returned from Birmingham I went to see Love's Labours Lost. It is an exquisite play, absolutely at one with my taste for pastoral poetry and for erudite imagery. I know this is your taste, too, so I hope that we can go together shortly. You will, I know, adore it as much as I do and I long to see it again - and especially with you.

      Apart from a circular letter to Mesens, Erika, Colin Agnew, Smart, Gainsborough, and brief notes to the New Statesman, Art News, The Times, and International Journal of Psychoanalysis I have told no-one about Michael's projected relations with the Lefevre. You will, of course, have already seen my communications to The Daily Express and Old Balls' Almanac on the subject so, tell Michael, I say nothing of these. And, of course, I [unclear]say[/unclear] James and Longden immediately but I know he wouldn't mind that.

      I wrote six letters on Sunday of a dutiful kind and today I am going to see about ringing up editors and go to Christies (two guineas this will produce). Tiny tells me you are busy making dresses. I look forward with great excitement (and Betty rather ambivalently in case she look too shabby by contrast) to seeing you in them.

      Oh Sylvia, I adore you. I hope that you can feel and believe in my love at this distance. I think from your letters that you do. I adore you my ravishing beauty and Muse, my rose and my lover.
      I love you
      Lawrence

      II
      On Saturday evening, after I had just returned from Birmingham I went to see Love's Labours Lost. It is an exquisite play, absolutely at one with my taste for pastoral poetry and for erudite imagery. I know this is your taste, too, so I hope that we can go together shortly. You will, I know, adore it as much as I do and I long to see it again--and especially with you.

      Apart from a circular letter to Mesens, Erika, Colin Agnew, Smart, Gainsborough, and brief notes to the New Statesmen, Art News, The Times, and International Journal of Psychoanalysis I have told no-one about Michael's projected relations with the Lefevre. You will, of course, have already seen my communications to The Daily Express and Old Balls' Almanac on the subject so, tell Michael, I say nothing of these. And, of course, I [unclear]rary[/unclear] James and Longden immediately but I know he couldn't mind that.

      I wrote six letters on Sunday of a dutiful kind and today I am going to see about ringing up editors and go to Christies (two guineas this will produce). Tiny tells me you are busy making dresses. I look forward with great excitement (and Hetty rather ambivalently in case she look too shabby by contrast) to seeing you in them. Oh Sylvia, I adore you. I hope that you can feel and believe in my love at this distance. I think from your letters that  you do. I adore you my ravishing beauty and Muse, my rose and my lover.

      I love you
      Lawrence
