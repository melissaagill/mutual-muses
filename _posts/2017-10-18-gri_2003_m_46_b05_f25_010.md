      three

      On the parallel bars of a kiss
      Lovers are foreign to claims of gravity:
      The visa of their lips, the hair of wings.
      Love, your pelvis has a lyre's shape.

      Give me the eye and vanish my disquiet.
      Is that a bridge on the left? I'll buy it..
      There is the table where the statues are,
      like lamp, and mermaid jug, and numbered book.

      The fruit makes canyons in the dawn
      Whose slopes are thick with mounting sleepers
      Shadowed by exquisite corridors
      Of vines and the sun-handled orchards.

      Palm of the hand, Tuscan cherries in it.
      Be with me in this concord when the glow worm
      Is lost but lost in light in which we draw
      The sun's fullface from the moor's profile.

      This is the world where the lamps implore
      The shadows to return the stolen lamps.
      This is the world in which I veer between
      The vertigo and beauty of desire.

      three
      On the parallel bats of a kiss
      Lovers are foreign to claims of gravity:
      The visa of their lips, the hair of wings.
      Love, youe pelvis has a lyre's shape.
      Give me the eye and vanish my disquiet.
      Is that a bridge on the left? i'll buy it..
      There is the table where the statues are,
      Like lamp, and mermaid jug, and numbered book.
      The fruit makes canyons in the dawn
      Whose slopes are thick with mounting sleepers
      Shadowed by exquisite corridors
      Of vines and the sun-handled [unclear]orcherds[/unclear]
      Palm of the hand, Tuscan cherries in it.
      Be with me in this concord when the glow worm
      Is lost bust lost in light in which we draw
      The sun's fullface from the moon's profile.
      This is the world where the lamps implore
      The shadows to return the stolen lamps.
      This is the world in which I veer between
      The vertigo and beauty of desire.
