      My dearest love,
      it is an eternity since I talked to you, days the clock puts it at nine and a half hours ago.  Love does not make the kind of time that cooks can tell us about. Therefore I must write. My hand is weighted by all I want to write but which I can only speak and, better, reveal by action. I shall resist tonight the fierce desire I have to ring you - just to wish you 'sleep well' and to hear your voice for a moment. That would be wonderful but I will hold back for your sake.
      Be assured of my love, Sylvia.  I long for you and the chance to prove in so many ways what my love means. How beautiful you are: I know you will say that you are 'battered' now but, remember, your beauty makes my heart beat faster. When I hold your locket to a light the stones glow a dark-red like fire. It is an emblem of my longing as well as a token of your love. How precious it is to me.
      Today I have worked on Mozart and your image has been present all the time: every work is dedicated to you. I have helped you to paint. You have given me the motive to write prose and, I need not say; you are the very substance of my poetry. I must tell you that basic in my love for you is recognition of what Pett means to you: your personality has possessed me amazingly, even to the point of communicating your distaste of the town.

      love,\nIt is an eternity since I talked to you, though the clock\nputs it at
      nine and a half hours ago. Love does not make\nthe kind of time that clocks
      can tell us about. Therefore\nI must write : my hand is weighted by all I want
      to write\nbut which I can only speak and, better, reveal by action.\nI shall
      resist tonight the fierce desire I have to ring you -\njust to wish you 'sleep
      well' and to hear your voice for\na moment. That would be wonderful but I will
      hold\nback for your sake.\nBe assured of my love, Sylvia. I long for you and\nthe
      chance to prove in so many ways what my love means.\nHow beautiful you are :
      I know you will say that you are\n'[unclear]battered[/unclear]' now but, remember,
      your beauty makes my\nheart beat faster. When I hold your locket to the\nlight
      the stones glow a dark-red like fire. It is an emblem\nof my longing as well
      as a token of your love. How precious\nit is to me.\nToday I have worked on
      [unclear]Mozarts[/unclear] and your image has \nbeen present all the time :
      every word is dedicated to you.\nI have helped you to paint. You have given
      me the [unclear]nature[/unclear] to\nwrite prose and, I need not say; you are
      the very sub-\nstance of my poetry. I must tell you that [unclear]basic[/unclear]
      in my\nlove for you is recognition of what Pett means to you : \nyour personality
      has possessed me amazingly, even to\nthe point of communicating your distaste
