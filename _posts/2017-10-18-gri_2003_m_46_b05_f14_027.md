      Dearest Lawrence,
      I hope that your lecture goes well -
      I thought of you especially at 3, and
      now it is 3.30 so I expect you that you
      are talking about H&p now. I saw
      you rather disgruntled looking back
      walking round the corner towards the Tate
      the bus passed very near you, and I
      wished so much that you would look
      round! I have not read very much
      of "the eighteen-nineties" because
      of the movement of the 'bus - but it seems
      extremely good.
      I am still sitting alone I'm glad to
      say, but I have sneezed once or twice
      and seem to be  very sensitive in the throat
      so I fear that I have a cold - I feel that
      it will only be a slight one though.
      Re one precious cyclamen - please will
      you keep it in the window - I really think
      that lack of light is the trouble because of  the colour
      of the leaves - I don't think that it

      Dearest Lawrence,
      I hope that you lecture goes well - I thought of you especially at 3, and now it is 3.30 so I expect that you are talking about [unclear]Aep/unclear] now. I saw your rather disgruntled [unclear][/unclear] back walking round the corner towards the Tate the 'bus passed very near you , and I wished so much that you would look round! I have not read very much of "the eighteen-nineties" because of the movement of the 'bus - but it seems extremely good.
      I am still sitting alone I am glad to say, but I have sneezed once or twice and seem to be very sensitive in the throat so I fear that I have a cold. I feel that it will only be a slight one though.
      Re. our precious cyclemen - please will you keep it in the window. I really think that lack of light is the trouble because of the colour of the leaves. I don't think that it
      Tiny says please get your sugar for if you don't want it or can't pay she will send the money s.
