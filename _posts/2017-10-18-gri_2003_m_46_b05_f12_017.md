      D. W. Griffith made True Heart Susie in 1919. It is corn.
      It sets out to consider which it is men value most - a loving
      heart or a pretty, powdered face. It also asks - what of those
      women (the ones with the loving hearts) whose fate it is to wait
      for the one man? The answers to these ridiculous questions
      are absolutely complacent. Much of the film satisfies the sup-
      posed wishes and standards of those who, not having pretty faces,
      consider their hearts capable of love. The view of the world
      presented is, therefore, to say the least of it, narrow. The
      good girl Susie and the gad girl Bettina have a reassuring rigid-
      ity. In the handling of the two actresses something of Grif-
      fith's exeptional quality shapes the corn: Bettina, the dark
      one, is always hipping it, running, extending her arm and flapping
      her hand ( we call it 'waving'): Susie, the fair Lilian Gish, on
      the other hand, is graceful in a constrained way, restrained, and
      when she is excited her jumps have a childishness untouched by
      Bettina's seductiveness. The contrast of these two figures al-
      ways manoeuvering around the solemn hero is charming - not just
      in terms of simple characterisation, but in terms of imagery and
      rhythmic movement. The action covers a number of years, long
      enough for the hero to marry Bettina, rue it, and lose her as a
      result of bad weather on the way home from an illicit party.
      Only after this is the true heart rewared. Time is almost
      Bergsonian in its happy avoidance of age and a sense of waiting.
      The narrative has the flow of phantasy, dwelling on emotional high-spots, of suffering or happiness, in an eternity of sentimental [unclear]fluses[/unclear].

      D.W. Griffith made True Heart Susie in 1919.  It is corn.
      It sets out to consider which it is men value most--a loving
      heart or a pretty, powdered face.  It also asks--what of those
      women (the ones with the loving hearts) whose fate it is to wait
      for the one man?  The answers to these ridiculous questions
      are absolutely complacent.  Much of the film satisfies the sup-
      posed wishes and standards of those who, not having pretty faces,
      consider their hearts capable of love.  The view of the world
      presented is, therefore, to say the least of it, narrow.  The
      good girl Susie and the bad girl Bettina have a reassuring rigid-
      ity.  In the handling of the two actresses something of Grif-
      fith's exceptional quality shapes the corn:  Bettina, the dark
      one, is always hipping it, running, extending her arm and flapping
      her hand (we call it 'waving'); Susie, the fair Lilian Gish, on
      the other hand, is graceful in a constrained way, restrained, and,
      when she is excited her jumps have a childishness untouched by
      Bettina's seductiveness.  The contrast of these two figures al-
      ways maneuvering around the solemn hero is charming--not just
      in terms of simple characterization, but in terms of imagery and
      rhythmic movement.  The action covers a number of years, long
      enough for the hero to marry Bettina, rue it, and lose her as a
      result of bad weather on the way home from an illicit party.
      Only after this is the true heart rewarded.  Time is almost
      Bergsonian in its happy avoidance of age and a sense of waiting.
      The narrative has the flow of fantasy, dwelling on emotional high-
      spots, of suffering or happiness, in an eternity of sentimental blue.
