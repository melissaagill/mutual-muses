      Monday    Blackheath

      My dearest Sylvia

      Alas, no letter from you this morning and your
      last letter on Saturday, though charming and most
      pleasing, was terribly short.  Do write at greater
      length - please, my rose.

      I can catch the 2.30 post with this letter.  I am
      reading Clifford's books and making 'vast' notes.
      When I have finished this letter I shall continue
      work.

      Molly and Eric came yesterday and Paul (Southey)
      came to dinner on Saturday :  he liked the Lion at
      Home, you may like to hear.

      You relied too much on my charm I'm afraid for
      I was unable to get you any tea with the loose coup-
      on.  The spirited girl we used to know at the Kardo-
      mah has gone.  I am so sorry.

      How are you?  You tell me nothing of yourself
      in your letters and though lions like love letters
      more than news they do like to know how cats are.
      Otherwise they worry.

      Saturday's lecture was, I think, a success :  there
      were at least 180 people.  At the end of Miss Mountcey-
      Wood (spelling?) appeared and a charming American.  I
      had to choose between them :  I choose the former, be-
      cause of pity, but, really she seems much worse.  Com-
      munication is almost impossible with her now.  I might
      as well have talked with the American.

      Tomorrow I have a N.G. lecture and then on Wednes-
      day two at Banstead.  Post-impressionism and symbolism
      is the third lecture in the course so Les Fauves and
      The Cubists will be the first lecture you willhear.

      Are you coming on Sunday or Monday?  Tell me soon.

      Monday Blackheath

      My dearest Sylvia

      Alas, no letter from you this morning and your last letter on Saturday, though charming and most pleasing, was terribly short. Do write at greater length - please, my rose.

      I can catch the 2.30 post with this letter. I am reading Clifford's books and making 'vast' notes. When I have finished this letter I shall continue work.

      Molly and Eric came yesterday and Paul (Southey) came to dinner on Saturday: he liked the Lion at Home, you may like to hear.

      You relied too much on my charm I'm afraid for I was unable to get you any tea with the loose coupon. The spirited girl we used to know at the Kardomah has gone. I am so sorry.

      How are you? You tell me nothing of yourself in your letters and though lions like love letters more than news they do like to know how cats are. Otherwise they worry.

      Saturday's lecture was, I think, a success: there were at least 100 people. At the end Miss Mounteey-Wood (spelling?) appeared and a charming American. I had to choose between them: I choose the former, because of pity, but, really she seems much worse. Communication is almost impossible with her now. I might as well have talked with the American.

      Tomorrow I have a N.G. lecture and then on Wednesday two at Banstead. Post-impressionism and symbolism is the third lecture in the course so Les Fauves and The Cubists will be the first lecture you will hear.

      Are you coming on Sunday or Monday? Tell me soon.
