      It was very good of you to send me your cheque -
      but I have not had to cash it because the W E A
      cheque came in time. So I return yours - torn in
      half for safety. I wish I had waited a little
      longer before asking you... Oh, well.

      You have anticipated my answers to your letters
      by saying it 'it really is probably of little use' to talk to
      me. So I cannot argue - or even accept your critic-
      isms without appearing merely evasive. I do
      think you are right - except in the unhappy conclu-
      sions you draw about our love. I must get a job,
      and soon - but, I imagine your saying, he only says
      that.

      Anyway, I am going to the Tavistock (I nearly said
      Clinic) Labour Exchange this afternoon.

      Try not to worry.

      I am glad your canvances have come.

      Thank you for telling me about Bacchres.
