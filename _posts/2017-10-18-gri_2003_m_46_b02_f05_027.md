    clean_transcription: ii<br/>new poems.  My love for you is so strong - <br/>I
      cannot wait for you to come.<br/>     when I have seen the Travel Bureau I<br/>will
      work out how much money we have<br/>and I'm sure we can get the secretaire -
      <br/>bookcase AND a comfortable bed.  Both<br/>acquisitions are desireable &
      important -<br/>and together will amount to about (money symbol) 43,<br/>I imagine.
      <br/>      I have been re-reading your letters and<br/>I must say I look forward
      to seeing you in<br/>new dresses.  You are a radient and de - <br/>lightful
      creature in summer dresses.  I<br/>adore you in all kinds of clothes but to-<br/>day,
      when the sun is warm on me and<br/>dazzling on this page it is Sylvia in<br/>summer
      dresses I think of particularly.<br/>Oh my dearest I adore, adore you<br/>                                            Lawrence
