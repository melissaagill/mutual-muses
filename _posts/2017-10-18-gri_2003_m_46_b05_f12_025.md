      Daf's interest in fashionable places (including London and the Derby). Explain his distortion which produces movement
      (sails of yachts in wind, for example). He obtains his rich
      colour by several methods of putting the paint on, too (discuss).

      Apart from commenting on the artist and what to look for in the individual paintings ilustrated I should try and draw some general conclusion each time. For instance about portraiture apropos of the Maugham portrait or about Sunday paintings generally in connection with Greaves, and so on.

      Toulouse-Lautrec: A Private Room at La Rat Mort.
      Quote from 90s literature about Paris night-life. Brief biography of artist: topical at present with Moulin Rouge being filmed. Over-emphasis on his deformity: great artist as well as a dwarf.

      Van Gogh: Sunflowers.
      Sunflowers one of series painted to welcome Paul Gauguin on visit. This visit ended in Van Gogh's first attac of madness. The popularity of Van Gogh's art shows Victorian taste for realism is breaking down. He expresses how he feels, not only what he sees.

      Renoir: La Loge.
      Great interest in contemporary life in 19c. France. Renoir presents a glamourised version of it. The apparently properous sitters actually his brother and a model. This painted to attract well-off sitters. Sometimes art makes up what reality misses. Biography.

      Bonnard: The Window.
      This artist continues Renoirs outlook on life, like to paint the sun, flowers, pretty girls. His art is very bold in colour and design; in character Bonnard was shy and reticent, however. Quote account on B. at work.

      Dufy: Deauville.
      Dufy's interest in fashionable places (including London and the Derby). Explain his distortions which produces movement (sails of yachts in wind, for examplet). He obtains his rich colour by several methods of putting the paint on, too (discuss).

      Pissarro: Boulevard des Italiens.
      Study of light and reflections not of solid objects themselves. Quote his letters concerning England, Paris as subject for painter, Mde. Pissarro. After life of struggle his old age spent in touring hotel bedrooms for views of the boulevards and bridges. Tie up with this picture.

      Utrillo: Porte S Martin.
      Paris as seen by Toulouse-Lautrec and Pissarro. Utrillo's Paris is for tourists. His version of the city has influences all of us in our idea of Montmartre, etc. Some biography.

      Picasso: Femme a la Chemise.
      Conditions of Picasso's life in early 20c. when he painted this work. Melancholy women delicately painted in 'blue' period, blue in colour and in mood. (Mention artist's subsequent
