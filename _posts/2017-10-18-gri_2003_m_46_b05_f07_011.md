      14 July 1952 N.G. My dearest Sylvia,
      Thank you so much for your two letters which
      arrived together this morning. They contain so
      much good news about your painting that is has
      made me feel confident and happy for the day.
      Your sketch of the cliff is very attractive. Rinaldo
      and Armida progresses excellently, to judge
      from your account. You mention Grant's
      school, or style, in connection with your new
      landscape: I disagree really, because your paint
      is always brilliant and lively whereas his, or
      theirs, is always dryish and blunt.

      Your description of your days at Pett are
      vivid and intimate and make me feel that
      my imagination has been accurate in decid-
      ing what you would be doing.  The jam-making
      at night excepted - that I did not guess, tho,
      apparently Tiny would have. (Speaking of
      Tiny - is she coming back today or will she
      extend her visit to Littlehampton, I wonder?)

      I enclose a copy of my review of the [unclear][/unclear]
      in Adrian Heath's studio. I hope it gives
      an idea of what it was like.

      N. G  14 July 1952

      My dearest Sylvia,
      Thank you so much for your two letters which arrived together this morning.  They contain so much good news about your paintings that it has made me feel confident and happy for the day.  Your sketch of the cliff is very attractive.  Rinald and Simdia progresses excellently, to judge from your account.  You mention Grant's school, on style, in connection with your new landscape:  I disagree really, because your paint is always brilliant and lively whereas his, or theirs, is always dryish and blunt.

      Your description of your days at Pett are vivid and intimate and make me feel that my imagination has been accurate in deciding what you would be doing.  The jam-making at night excepted - that I did not guess tho' apparently tiny would have.  (Speaking of Tiny - is she coming back today or will she extend her visit to Littlehampton, I wonder ?)

      I enclose a copy of my review of the show in Adrian Heath's studio.  I hope it gives an idea of what it was like.

      1952\nMy dearest Eylvia, \nThank you so much for your two letters which arrived
      together this morning. They contain so much good news about your painting that
      is has made me feel confident and happy for the day. Your stretch of the cliff
      is very attractive. Rinaldo and Armida progresses excellently, to judge from
      your account. You mention Grant's school, or style, in connection with your
      new landscape: I disagree really, because your paint is always brilliant and
      lively whereas his, or theirs, is always dryish and blunt.\nYour description
      of your days at Pitt are vivid and intimate and make me feel that my imagination
      has been accurate in deciding what you would be doing. The jam making at night
      excepted - that I did not guess tho apparently Tiny would have (Speaking of
      Tiny - is she coming back today or will she extend her visit to littlehampton,
      I wonder?)\nI enclose a copy of my review of the show in Adrian Heath's studio.
      I hope it gives an idea of what it was like."
