      managed to buy it second hand - just don't forget 'Sylvie and Bruno' and at least one other early book if you have room.  I will send you dates as soon as I get your next letter which will perhaps suggest when you will come.  I shall tell my parents today that I am definitely going.
      I hate this notepaper but it was a gift from a small cousin and I can find nothing else to use. Sorry...
      I shall hurry and try to catch the 2.15 post so that you will perhaps get this letter tomorrow morning.  It's main purpose is, of course, to say again how passionately and fully I love you, my dearest, my only love.
