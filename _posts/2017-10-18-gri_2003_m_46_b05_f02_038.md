      Here is a poem dealing with the various ways in which a character may be presented, directly, 3rd person, through other people's eyes. 8C. 1C was suggested by an observation in Claude Edmond- Mogny's article on The Devil in Contemporary Literature: of Edmond Teste, 'we catch a glimpse only of him through his wife, his friend, or his log book.'

      Scarred by glass or winter
      The softlog near the icon,
      Burrowed by names like water by bubbles:
      He is, via image, one.

      Well, it was midnight. June.
      I came in. I didn't have to knock.
      He was stretched on the bed,
      Unshaven, window open, reading-
      The lamp jumping with creatures.
