      a flute made by hand,
      A [unclear]moon[/unclear] shaped like a hunting barn

      The mediterannean
      [unclear]dashes[/unclear] passports away.
      It is the bluest sea
      Behind the ghosts I know.

      Au Sud
      The morning [unclear]toss[/unclear] of the sea.
      The sun's gold ferns.
      landscape with banana leaf
      And structures of vine

      And from a [unclear]tall[/unclear] pergola
      As in a jardiniere
      You watch the maybe hills.
      landscape with viaduct

      The sky is fresco-hard
      The sun is tribal there.
      lucky you are to sip
      The wine of the country.
      It is Sunday now. About seven in the evening. I have given up [unclear]now[/unclear] try-
      ing to guess your movements in Paris: concerts in Paris do not start, of
      course, for another hour or hour-and-a-half. I hope, for your sake, you did
      not run into Albert or Dennis: Dennis lives not far from the Rue Racine,
      you know. Who have you met among Viollet le Duc's gargoyles this time?
      By the way - are there any special exhibitions in Paris, at present?
