      Pelt                   14.2.52
      Dearest Lawrence,
      Thank you for your letter - I am longing to see you and hold you in my arms again, dear love.
      I will ask Tiny to get me a place on Saturday afternoon[unclear] 'bus[/unclear]--if she can't I will come in the morning (Sat:) or by train.  In which case I will send you a telegram --So unless you hear to the contrary I shall reach Lewisham about 5.0. as you say.  It would be lovely if you could meet me, but if it is difficult I shall quite understand.  I have ordered the meat--lean chops -, which will come tomorrow, and I shall also be bringing 1/2 a pineapple.
      I'm so sorry that Tuesday's discussion was so disappointing - how silly.
      I am so happy that you are writing poems again  - I was just saying to Tiny that you hadn't done much for some time.

      I am so happy that you are writing
