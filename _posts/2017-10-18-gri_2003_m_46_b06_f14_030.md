      Dearest Lawrence,
      Would you mind sticky on

      won't be all those I have included
      labels for.

      up Chase.  I don't know if he told
      you his news--that the cards weren't
      printed and that I will not now
      be able to have green hammered card
      He is putting through some kind of "rush
      order" and I suppose I will get them

      letters the 1st saying I would fetch them
      on Monday 9th and a second one
      on the Tuesday 3rd or Wednesday the 4th
      saying as I could not come--being
      ill would he please send them as soon
      as possible.  Realizing he had his private
      views I didn't write again but having
      nothing this morning on Tiny's advice I
