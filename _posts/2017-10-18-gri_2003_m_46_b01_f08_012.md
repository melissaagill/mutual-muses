      11 Mansel Road
      Wimbledon

      7.1X.1948

      Dearest Sylvia,

      Would you think it too naive, too eager of me to arrive in Hasting on Tuesday at 10:40?  I can get a train from Victoria at 8:45. Is that too early for you? Your cards and catalogues will be interesting though I doubt if I shall concentrate on them quite as hard as I should. Seeing you so briefly so rarely I am reluctant to waste a moment of your company.

      Tonight on the radio are Summerson on Chiswick House and Edith Sitnell on her early poetry.

      I finished Mr. Richardson's Books of Connaissance today, so feel I know all about pictures. I shall look at your latest work with a new understanding and a new range of jargon. I find you want [unclear] all Antique Taft I feel [/unclear] lag critically.

      Here are some poems for you. The first three are all remains of a larger and more emotional piece I wrote after our last meeting. They may not please you. I hardly know myself.  Lessing says that the Owl of Minerva only comes out at night - a lonely way of suggesting irrational thought: I must get it into a poem.

      I look forward very much to seeing you again. I'll bring Michael's Biro then. Your little white owl is very excited at the thought of seeing you again. He is going to fly on ahead of the train and will arrive at 10:39.

      I love you. I love you very much.

      Lawrence

      Don't tell me if it is.

      7. IX. 1948
      Dearest Sylvia
      Would you think it too naive, to eager of me to
      arrive in [unclear]Hastings[/unclear] on Friday at 10.40? I can get
      a train from Victoria at 8.45. Is that too early
      for you? (Don't tell me if it is.) Your cards and catalogues will be
      interesting though I doubt if I shall concentrate on
      them quite as hard as I should. Seeing you so
      briefly so rarely I am reluctant to waste a moment
      of your company.
      Tonight on the radio are [unclear][/unclear] on Chiswick
      House and Edith Sitwell on her early poetry.
      I finished [unclear]M. Richardson's[/unclear] Book of [unclear]Connaissance[/unclear]
      today, so feel I know all about Pictures. I shall look
      at your latest Work with a new Understanding and a
      New Range of Jargon. 'I find you want the Antique [unclear]Taste[/unclear]',
      I shall say critically.
      Here are some poems for you. The first three are
      the remains of a longer and more emotional piece I wrote
      after our last meeting. They may not please you. I hardly
      know myself. Lessing says that the Owl of Minerva
      only comes out at night - a lovely way of suggesting
      irrational though: I must get it into a poem.
      I look forward very much to seeing you again.
      I'll bring Michael's Biro then. Your little white Owl
      is very excited at the thought of seeing you again. He is
      going to fly on ahead of the train and will arrive at 10.39.
      I love you. I love you very much.
      Lawrence
