      Lion is rather rushed. I am ready Monday & Tues-
      day lectures: Monday is xxthc. Masterpieces. I am doing large
      works by Rousseau, Picarro, Derchan, Leges, Oagull. Then
      on Tuesday Madigliani & ittnillo about whom I know very
      little, at the moment. Yesterday I lectured at the NG on
      se Greco & Zurara (110 or so people): it was nice to give
      a public lecture there again.

      Paul Harding has a beard, a small one all round hi face, which he is on
      the verge of cutting into what can only be described as a
      Newgate Fringe. I think that will suit him. We saw a
      technicolour musical - If You Feel Like Singin' with
      Gene Kelly. It was pleasant but no Singin' In The Rain..

      Well I must get on with my lecture notes befor Par-
      more comes.

      I love & adore you  xxxxxx

      P.S. The dandylion is blooming - 2 fine flowers!

      PPS Mandy has been operated on bu tis not expected
      our of hospital for a fortnight or so. She
      is alright, I understand, bu the operation was
      bigger than was expected.

      I know very little, at the moment. Yesterday I lectured at A N G on El greco
      &  Zurbara (110 or so people); it was nice to give a public lecture there again.\n\nPaul
      Harding has a beard, a small one all round his face, which he is on the verge
      of cutting into what can only be described as a Newgate Fringe. I think that
      will suit him. We saw a technicolour musical - If You Feel Like Singin' with
      Gene Kelly. It was pleasant but no Singin' In The Rain.\n\nWell I must get on
