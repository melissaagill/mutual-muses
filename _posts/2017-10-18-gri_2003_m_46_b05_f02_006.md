      2    Let me tell you a little about my lectures.
      On Monday the taxi took me to a school of physical
      training instead of the academic training col-
      lege in Bedford.  Once that was straightened ot,
      however, the lecture went off quite well to CA 100
      girls.  I went for a walk in Bedford.  It is real-
      ly rather pretty in its haphazard, suburban
      manner.  The hotel was not particularly pleas-
      ant and I was offered fish or Bubble and squeak for
      breakfast.  I squeaked protestingly.
      AT Cambridge I saw Thoms.  He is no brighter
      than when I just met him and insists on all kinds
      of confidence (mainly financial) which I must keep
      in myself, he says.  But since he confides in a comparative
      stranger I feel he is more of a whole to himself
      than I am.  (He has more sources of weave than, and C.
      be..)  I looked quickl in the Fitzmiller for the
      figures like those in the V and A you examined
      on Monday but missed them somehow (I had
      little time).
      The lecture was to midwives and Health Vis-
      itors.  It was held in the X-Ray room, be-
      cause it could easily be blacked out.  Great
      machines, sinks, screens, rubber cables, all
      over the place.  This too I think was quite fav-
      orably received.  Instead of geraniums judg-
      ing (or whatever that WI wanted) I was asked ad-
      vice on a suitable play for the midwives to
      visit in London.  I disodnered Zip Goes A
      Million which one remember was billen on....

      2 Let me tell you a little about my lectures. On Monday the taxi took me to a school of physical training instead of the academic training col-lege in Bedford. Once that was straightened out, however, the lecture went off quite well to ca 100 girls. I went for a walk in Bedford. It is real-ly rather pretty in its haphazard, suburban manner. The hotel was not particularly pleas-ant & I was offered fish or Bubble & squeak for breakfast. I squeaked protestingly.

         At Cambridge I saw Thoms. He is no brighter than when I first met him & insists on all kinds of confidences (mainly financial) which I must keep to myself, he says. But since he confides in a comparative stranger I feel he is more of a menace to himself than I am. (He has more sources of income than, &c. &c.) I looked quickly in the Fitzwilliam for the figures like those in the V & A you examined on Monday but missed them somehow (I had little time).

         The lecture was to Midwives & Health Vis-itors. It was held in the X-Ray room, because it could easily be blacked out. Great machines, sinks, screens, rubber cables, all over the place. This too I think was quite fav-orably received. Instead of geranium judg-ing (or whatever that WI wanted) I was asked ad-vice on a suitable play for the midwives to visit in London. I dis-admired Zip Goes A Million which one member was keen on . . . .
