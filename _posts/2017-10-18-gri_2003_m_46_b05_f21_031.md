      that you are feeling<br/>strong again. What a pity I can't take<br/>you abroad
      and feed you up for the <br/>winter, well you can rest and I <br/>will feed
      you up as well as I <br/>can while you are here. I enclose<br/>a copy of An
      advertisement<br/>that is in to-day's Times - I could<br/>not cut it out as
      there is something<br/>about Chaplin's film on the back <br/>it seems that it
      was received with <br/>acclaim. New York. - It seems<br/>to me the very job
      for my Lion _<br/>and I think he has the right<br/>qualifications for it; so
      do write<br/>for it - I think it well worth it. <br/>did you have any replies
      from the <br/>Birmingham? etc
