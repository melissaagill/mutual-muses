      Blackheath 10 II 1949

      Dearest Sylvia -
      I have just this moment finished a Hogarth chapter - the one about the book illustration. Tomorrow I shall start the biographical chapters which ought to be easy to write - then I'll have a lot to send off to Hodders.
      You are studying nephology very particularly at the moment! I have a fondness for cloud-images so I especially long to see your cloud images. I am very attached to the Orchard view.
      I am glad you are thinking of wash -[unclear] .[/unclear]

      10 II 1949

      Blackheath

      Dearest Sylvia -
      I have just this moment finished a Hogarth chapter - the one about the book illustrations.  Tomorrow I shall start the biographical chapters which ought to be easy to write - then I'll have a lot to send off to Hodders.

      You are studying nephology very particularly at the moment!  I have a fondness for cloud-images so I especially [unclear]love[/unclear] to see your cloud images.  I am very attached to the orchard view.

      I am glad you are thinking of [unclear]work-[/unclear]
