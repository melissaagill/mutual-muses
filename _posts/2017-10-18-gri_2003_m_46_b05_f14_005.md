      Pett

      Dearest Lawrence,
      I hope that your journeys
      have been comfortable and uneventful
      and that you had a warm room
      at Bedford.  When you get this
      you will have been to Cambridge,
      in fact you will be starting your
      lecture now I fancy it--being
      ten past 3.  I have begun my
      painting sketched in it, and I
      am painting some very over-ripe
      bananas on the sight of the picture
      (as they won't last long and may
      mark the table if I leave them),
      and the apples immediately in
      front of them.  I hope to start
      on the big "pumpkin" today as
      well--in fact the thing is a kind
      of round marrow.  I am very glad
      to be painting again.  I have
      the grapes but not a pineapple.
      Clifford is going to look out for
      on for me however.
