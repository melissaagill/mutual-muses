      made of it in my sketch; it is like this (drawing of a vase). This is a travesty too, but it gives a better idea. I can't remember how this goes.
      It is I think a very fine specimen-and very precious so I shall paint it as quickly as possible and return it. I shall also learn something about [unclear][/unclear] urns!
      The news about Tiny's sister is particularly bad. She has been very ill, and is now partially paralyzed-but is getting better again. And may be sent home. Everyone hopes she  may die quickly.
      To make matters worse when Desiree sat for me she provoked me to say something against her mother-which was very stupid of me. She repeated it, and Tiny had a frightful "show down" with Sybella which seems to have been most upsetting
