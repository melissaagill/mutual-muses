      Pett
      Dearest Lawrence
      I sent off about 120 cards
      this morning and have another 25
      addresses to get from the Telephone
      book.  I wonder how many you
      have sent!  I couldn't find Connolly's
      (Cyril) address I wonder if you could
      find it for me and send him one--
      he lives in a house in Regents Park.
      I have written to Iris and sent
      off to Vogue, and Paul Harding.
      You can just give Paul S a card.
      Thank you so much for Firmging
      Chase.  I'm sure that was a great
      help.  I think I shall go back
      on Wednesday or Thursday to Pett
      I shall try to get a lot done on
      Monday!  I shall have to come
      up again on Sunday the 1st or
      Monday 2nd you see!
