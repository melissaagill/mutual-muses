      I had tea with (3) yesterday & today I am having lunch at
      Davie's place so I can write about him in (2).  By
      the way, Dec. Art News has come (well, finally) & my piece doesn't read
      at all badly - as you said.

      I am looking forward to 1954 more than I have ever
      looked forward to any new year.  This is the year.
      We shall really be starting it right.  I love love
