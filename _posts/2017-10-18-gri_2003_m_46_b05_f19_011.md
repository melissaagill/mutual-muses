      3.

         I haven't any news really.  I feel rather frustrated as there are so many odd jobs to do I don't quite know where to begin!   However I have done some of them.  I hope to get a long day's painting tomorrow so I shall feel better.  I expect I shall work a bit on Rinaldo and Armida after tea.
         I am longing to see you and perhaps - if we are very careful I could spend the week with you - but I certainly haven't much to spare!
         I love you dearly, my Lion Lion,
               I love you
                      Sylvia

      P.S. I hope I can stay at least a night with you on my way back from Bath - but I will discuss this with you.  You don't say when you expect to go.  S.
