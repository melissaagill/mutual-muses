      11 Mansel Road Wimbledon

      6th October, 1948

      My Dearest Sylvia,

      I wish that you could have been with me this after-
      noon to Beckett's.  He has a very nice collection:  port-
      traints by Kneller, Highmore, Riley, and Lely (two fine ones):  landscapes by Wilson (about eight), Turner and Constable and Morland, &c.  I imagined the ones you would have liked and this increased my pleasure.  One day in the future we might be able to visit him togeth-
      er if you like.  He has lent me lots of photographs of Hogarths and given me addresses to write to:  I must get in touch with Antal.  Klingender said he is stern but Beckett says he's nice.  All this is not ir-relevant in what is designedly a love letter because the application I bring to this work has, as you know, an inspiration sweeter than scholarship.

      Our talk this morning has made me less agitated and if I worried you before it was only because I was over-anxious.  The possibility of sharing your life was sud-
      denly brought close and at the same moment communication became terribly difficult when it should have been easy.  These two things combined to upset me.  (The coolest Dandylion could hardly remain unaffected.)  But remem-
      ber dearest love, that to live simply by not upsetting Michael, keeping things going on his own irrational terms, is an impossible and humiliating situation to maintain for long through for your dear sake I am accepting it now.

      I hope you have a nice time at the Bergmanns.  The glimpse you gave me of them on the beach at Pett with you made them sound very pleasant.  I expect a Visit will do you both good after working in the flat so long.  Alas, that I could not have come along in a practical role:

      I love you, I love you.
      Lawrence

      Wimbledon

      6th October, 1948

      My dearest Sylvia,

      I wish that you could have been with me this after-
      noon to Beckett's. He has a very nice collection: por-
      traits by Kneller, Highmore, Riley, and Lely (two fine
      ones): landscapes by Wilson (about eight), Turner and
      Constable and Morland, c. I imagined the ones you
      would have liked and this increased my pleasure. One
      day in the future we might be able to visit him togeth-
      er if you like. He has lent me lots of photographs
      of Hogarths and given me addresses to write to: I must
      get in touch next with Antal. Klingender said he is
      stern but Beckett says he's nice. All this is not ir-
      relevant in what is designedly a love letter because
      the application I bring to this work has, as you know,
      an inspiration sweeter than scholarship.

      Our talk this morning has made me less agitated and
      if I worried you before it was only because I was over-
      anxious. The possibility of sharing your life was sud-
      denly brought close and at the same moment communication
      became terribly difficult when it should have been easy.
      These two things combined to upset me. (The coolest
      Dandylion could hardly remain unaffected.) But remem-
      ber, dearest love, that to live simply by not upsetting
      Michael, keeping things going on his own irrational
      terms, is an impossible and humiliating situation to
      maintain for long though for your dear sake I am accept-
      ing it now.

      I hope you have a nice time at the Bergmanns. The
      glimpse you gave me of them on the beach at Pett with you made them sound very pleasant. I expect a Visit
      will do you both good after working in the flat so long.
      Alas, that I could not have come along in a practical role:

      Please turn me up this
      way.

      I love you, I love you.
