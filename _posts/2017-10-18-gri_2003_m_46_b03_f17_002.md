      2 She was a kind of super Bessie Bunter, though she has a fat body, most of her obesity seems to have gone to her face!
      Yawalla was very good and snuggled down in my coat and went to sleep - he looked sweet there he is in Dandy's woolies It was with great pleasure that I found [unclear]liny[/unclear] waiting for me, she had been to Bexhill and heard Clifford give an excellent lecture.  I had missed the 'bus so we had tea together and a lovely gossip.  Yawalla eat a lot of cakes!
      We arrived here safely.  Everything is very clean ans pretty.  Mrs Owens has put flowers in the sitting room and Michael isn't coming home until tomorrow evening.  So I shall get down to work on my painting straight away, and go in for the frame on Thursday.  There is no word here from [unclear]our[/unclear] tenant or the Kensington Gallery.
