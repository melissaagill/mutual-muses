      14th October, 1948

      Dearest Sylvia,

      Do you realize that you have written 70 letters to me? (I exclude one formal note instructing me about my first visit to Pett.) I must have sent you as many and yest this letter is the one most difficult to write. If I am clumsy please remember another earlier letter in which I have pleased you. Remember what must be about 100 poems.

      I love you, Sylvia. You came to me last night. Why did I not accept it at that? Because my heart struggles for a complete expression of love. Because the strain of waiting and hoping has been so difficult. I was ruthless. Forgive the pain I caused you. It is all mine now. Remember, and do believe, that, although I have hurt you, I hope for your happiness. Do not doubt my love. I love you and will never stop. I love you.

      It is a terrible day for your return to Pett. But I hope that once there you will attain, out of your present indifference, ease. I hope with all my heart for the tranquility which I have done much to imperil. But do not put all the blame on me: circumstances, and not only Lawrence, are guilty.

      I believe what I learned last night has not been in vain and I trust you so that I know it is not too late.

      Although I welcomed you to London with some poems I can't say much about your departure because I am disturbed. May I give you two quotations:

      From town fair Arabella flies;
      The beaux unpowder'd grieve. (T. Parnell)

      Oh, for some other fear than this!
      Love is leaving town. (Charles H. Ford)

      Dearest Sylvie,

      Do you realize that you have written 70 letters to me? (I exclude one formal note instructing me about my first visit to Pett.) I must have sent you as many and yet this letter is the one most difficult to write. If I am clumsy please remember another earlier letter in which I have pleased you. Remember what must be about 100 poems.

      I love you, Sylvie. You came to me last night. Why did I not accept it at that?. Because my heart struggles for a complete expression of love. Because the strain of waiting and hoping has been so difficult. I was ruthless.  Forgive the pain I caused you. It is all mine now. Remember, and do believe, that, although I have hurt you, I hope for your happiness.  Do not doubt my love. I love you and will never stop. I love you.

      It is a terrible day for your return to Pett. But I hope that once there you will attain, cut of your present indifference, ease. I hope with all my heart for the tranquility which I have done much to imperil. But, do not put all the blame on me: circumstances, and not only Lawrence, are guilty.

      I believe what I learned last night has not been in vain and I trust you so that I know it is not too late.

      Although I welcomed you to London with some poems. I can't say much about your departure because I am disturbed. May I give you two quotations:
      From town fair Arabella flies:
      The beaux unpowder'd grieve.   (T. Parnell)
