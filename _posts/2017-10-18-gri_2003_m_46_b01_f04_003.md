      some architecture on the way as well as getting the sun; there are some very
      pretty streets past Richmond and I may come back through Chiswick. Or I may
      sit in the garden. Either way my thoughts will be very roughly the same - unconnected

      It is another festival I should have liked to attend
      than this. I wish… Well, it couldn't be. I love
      you, love you. Here, at least, is a birthday poem not
      too far in the wake of the 8th:

      Goodbye the columns and the ghosts of Greeks
      Wearing profiles while as handerkerchiefs
      And white as teeth in a recent smile
      Goodbye the columns

      Goodbye the house which shook and shook
      When giants of the sun walked on the roof
      For hours on end and season's length and more
      Goodbye the house

      Goodbye hairdresser with secret hands
      Delicate as the Venetian ambassador
      Reflected in a glass of wine
      Goodbye hairdresser

      Hello the columns and the ghosts of Greeks
      Wrestling nude on the eighth of May
      And white as teeth in a recent smile
      Hello the columns

      Hello the house where the doors open
      On rooms of exhilerating games of chance
      While giants of the sun shake the roof
      Hello the house

      Hello hairdresser with secret hands
      Delicate now as ever before and always
      She is overpowered by your charms' greeting
      Hello hairdresser

      This afternoon I think I shall borrow Eric's bicycle
      and go to the river and have a look at some architecture
      on the way as well as getting the sun; there are some
      very pretty streets past Richmond and I may come back
      through Chiswick. Or I may sit in the garden. Either
      way my thoughts will be very roughly the same - uncon-
      nected with the décor.

      I hope Michael is not too distressed now; perhaps
      your birthday has cheered him up - or has it provided
      another opportunity for melancholy? Oh dear, does
      that sound cool? Well, hell, why shouldn't it!

      Adore you.

      Be sure to paint despite housework, despite study.
      Be sure to paint.
      Lawrence
