      15 x 1948

      Dearest Sylvia,

      I am so sorry you were not feeling well this morning. I hope for your complete recovery by the time you get this letter. It was pleasant to be able to talk with you this morning - it softened the transition from daily talks to letters. Perhaps I can ring again next week. Even guarded talks are nice with you. And in the meantime be sure that I shall write. Remember how you said you felt complacent when the postman came: please help me to.

      Is the Greenwood prize anything to do with the Greenwoods I know? 20. Hmm. Talking of The Listener: this revaluation of Landseer, of all the Victorian bastards, makes me think there is a market for Watts and the Venetian tradition and Egg's Place in European Art: You do the first, I the second. I know just the place for Egg.

      By tomorrow I think I can finish my Analysis of Beauty chapter. Then I can get on two what will probably be two chapters, part written, on the early works.

      I am so sorry you were not feeling
      well this morning. I hope for your
      complete recovery by the time you get

      able to talk with you this morning - it

      Talking of The Listener: this revalua-
      tion of Landseer, of all the Victorian
      bastards, makes me think there is a mar-
      ket for Watts and the Venetian tradition
      and Egg's Place in European Art: You do
      the first, I the second. I know just
      the place for Egg.

      Wimbledon

      15 x 1948

      Dearest Sylvia,

      I am so sorry you were not feeling well this morning. I hope for your complete recovery by the time you get this letter. It was pleasant to be able to talk with you this morning - it softened the transition from daily talks to letters. Perhaps I can ring again next week. Even guarded talks are nice with you. And in the meantime be sure that I shall write. Remember how you said you felt complacent when the post-man came: please help me to.

      Is the Greenwood prize anything to do with the Greenwoods I know? Â£20. Hmm. Talking of The Listener: this reevaluation of Landseer, of all the Victorian bastards, makes me think there is a market for Watts and the Venetian tradition and Egg's Place in European Art: You do the first, I the second. I know just the place for Egg.

      By tomorrow I think I can finish my Analysis of Beauty chapter. Then I can get on two what will probably be two chapters, part written, on the early works.
