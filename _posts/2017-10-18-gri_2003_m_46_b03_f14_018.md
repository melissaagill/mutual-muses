      2 all the same for her part she will be very glad to have some - most grateful! She and Clifford send their love. I have told them your news, in which they take great interest.
       I have not been able to paint much today - the weather was bad this afternoon - and this morning though clear, was much too windy. But I worked a little on Tiny's portrait which is still not right, but better I think. If it is not fine tomorrow I shall see if it is convenient to paint "Frankie" again. So far I have only done a "sketch-head" in an upright rectangle - I hope to put in a kitten, I have not drawn the arms yet so I'm not quite sure how they'll be.
      - striped cushion
      I admit I am sorry that the "German Primatives" are over - one gets so little
