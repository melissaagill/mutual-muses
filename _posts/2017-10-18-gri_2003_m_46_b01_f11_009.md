      Do not abuse Apollo so,
      Gold in the dare of morning,
      The forest fire, the lantern,
      Because his warmth and energy
      Is love's prime symbol not his enemy

          George III had a bridge made in one night so that so that when his lady woke in the morning, at Kew it was, she would see this unexpected addition to the view. It spanned the lake.   This morning I have written the following poem for you:

      We knew the lawns of love,
      Suave turf compiling vistas
      Between the formal groves,
      The wilderness, The knot,
      The partners and the arch.

      But love worked in the night
      And made a classic bridge
      Linking the island and the lawn
      Above the water lilies,
      Above the twinkling fins.

      We cross the bridge my darling
      Our hearts made in a night:
      We are the architects
      And putti laid each stone.

         I am happy you are painting well and I am most excited at the thought of a self-portrait. It will be difficult I imagine but you will do it beautifully.

      Do not abuse Apollo so,
      Gold in the dare of morning,
      The forest fire, the lantern,
      Because his warmth and energy
      Is love's prime symbol not his enemy.

      George III had a Bridge made in one night so that when his lady woke in the morning, at Kew it was, she would see this unexpected addition to the view.  It spanned a lake.  This morning I have written the following poem for you:

      We knew the lawns of love,
      Suave turf compiling vistas
      Between the formal groves,
      The wilderness, the knot,
      The parterre and the arch.

      But love worked in the night
      And made a classic bridge
      Linking the island and the lawn
      Above the waterlilies,
      Above the twinkling fins.

      We cross a bridge my darling
      Our hearts made in a night:
      We were the architects
      And putti laid each stone.

      I am happy you are painting well and I am most excited at the thought of a self-portrait.  It will be difficult I imagine but you will do it beautifully.
