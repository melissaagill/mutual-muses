      reviewing a recent production, it appears. Molly also brought me 'The Times' with the obituary of [unclear]Maine[/unclear]: it is nice as far as it goes, I thought.
      Well, Lion returns to the world today: he must do so in a few minutes- thank heavens. But before I close this letter I must tell you a story of when I was a cub (4 1/2). I visited an aunt at Bournemouth who had trained marrows to grow up an arch in her (seriously Victorian) garden. This was explained to me after I entered the arch, looked up, and exclaimed: 'Good Gracious'- (You see how deep-seated my expressions are!)

      I love you
      Lawrence
