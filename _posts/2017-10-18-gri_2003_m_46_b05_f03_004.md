      Thank you so much for the latest of your long and delightful letters - what
      a good letter-writer you are- keeping your lion informed and warming him
      with words of love. (You will have received yesterday's letter by now:

      Sorry about my hand: Tuesday's subject is CUBISM. Next, after all, a
      lecture on cubism in Tate Gallery Masterpieces - or something of the kind.
      I am very interested to hear about The Street Car, though I am sorry to

      all, you've never been in New Orleans, have you. Well, then, says
      Hetty. The cuts you mention interest me very much. I shall read
      the play as you suggest before seeing the film. By the way, which
      depressed you - the film, or reading the play. I assume that it
      was the former mostly. Is that the case?
      You are a fine cat: I am so happy to hear you have been wearing
      gloves. The chickens in the garden do seem to be a wretched nuisance!
      By the way here is a sketch of the electro-plated 'tureen' or
      what ever it should be properly called so that when you come here
      you will not be taken by surprise (you remember it was an X'mas

      You are a fine [unclear]cat[/unclear]: I am so happy to hear you have been wearing

      My dearest Sylvia
      Thank you so much for the latest of your long and delightful letter. what a good letter-writer you are - [unclear]keeping[/unclear] your lion informed and warming him with words of love. (You will receive yesterday's letter [unclear]if now[/unclear]: will you come on Thursday I wonder. as I hope so.)

      Sorry about my hand: Tuesday's subject is CUBISM. Not, after all, a lecture on cubism in Tate [unclear]Solley[/unclear] Masterpiece - or something of the kind.

      I am very interested to hear about _The Street car_. though I am sorry to learn it depressed you. I hope that you are cheerful again now: after all, you've never been in New Orleans, have you. Well, then, says [unclear]Mettz[/unclear]. The cuts you mention interest me very much. I shall read the play as you suggest before seeing the film. By the way, which depressed you - the film, or _reading_ the play. I assume that it was the former mostly. Is that the case?

      You are a fine cat: I am so happy to hear you have been wearing gloves. The chickens in the garden do seem to be a wretched nuisance!

      By the way here is a sketch of [unclear]the[/unclear] electro-plated 'tureen' or what ever it should be properly called so that when you come here you will not be taken by surprise (you remember it was an X'mas present):

      Today I am going to see [unclear]Zadheine's[/unclear] exhibition and [unclear]then[/unclear] go to the I.C.A. where Z. himself will talk about modern sculpture.

      I am afraid that our cyclamin has _not_ survived. Perhaps it will revive next year. I hope so.

      Blackheath  3.3.52
      Monday
      My dearest Sylvia
      Thank you so much for the latest of your long and delightful letter. What a good letter writer you are - keeping you lion informed and warming him with words of love. (You will have received yesterday's letter by now: will you come on Thursday I wonder, as I hope so.)
      Sorry about my  hand: Tuesday's subject is CUBISM. Not, after all, a lecture on Cushion Im Tate Tattey Masterpiece - or something of the kind.
      I am very interested to hear about The Street Car, though I am sorry to learn it depressed you. I hope that you are cheerful again now: after all, you've never been in New Orleans, have you. Well, then, says Hetty. The [unclear]cute[/unclear] you mention interest me very much. I still shall read the play as you suggest before seeing the film. By the way, which depressed you - the film, or reading the play. I assume that it was the former mostly. Is that the case?
      You are a fine cat: I am so happy to hear you have been wearing gloves. The children in the garden do seem to be a wretched nuisance.
      By the way here is a sketch of the electro-plated 'tureen' or what ever it should be properly called so that when you come here you will not be taken by surprise (you remember it was an x'mas present):
      Today I am going to see Zadhine's exhibition and then go to the I.C.A. where Z. himself will talk about modern sculpture.
      I am afraid that our cyclamen has not survived. Perhaps it will revive next year. I hope so.
      I have just been fixing up April lectures at the TG with Miss [unclear]Clamot[/unclear] as she is going  away.
      Look after yourself as I look after you in imagination.
      I love you Sylvia Love you
      Lawrence.
