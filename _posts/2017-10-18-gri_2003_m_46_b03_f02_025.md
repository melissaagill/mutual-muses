      Dearest Sylvia,
      Oh, my beatiful creature, my rose, my
      minerva, how I love you, my Venetian.
      Your letters keep [unclear]lion[/unclear] on his best behav-
      ior and he reads them ones several times and
      imagines you doing all the things you describe.
      You certainly seem interested in Giogione,
      now. I hope Martin Conway's book comes to-
      day - it ought to, I sent it off yesterday
      by letter post.
      Today I have those [unclear]metded[/unclear] photographers
      which is a most [unclear]unattra ckine[/unclear] prospect. I wish
      I could stay here and work. Quelle bare!
      Also lunch with Gourmandinet.
      I have not slept very well these past two
      nights - I don't know why - so feel very sleepy,
      sitting curled up in an armchair in the sun.
      I wish there were no N G lecture today.
      Yes - I agree - [unclear]Flugel's[/unclear] Henry VIII has the complex
