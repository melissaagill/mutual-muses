      Blackheath.  08/26/1949
      Dearest Sylvia,
      I am glad your pen is still working. I have found your other one and I will send it off to you tomorrow.

      Yesterday I got your yard and a quarter for the autumn dress and ordered 2 and a quarter yards of the rococo pattern. I have resolved to be more prompt and decisive than, perhaps, I have been writing to everybody,  [unclear] & c.[/unclear], and the speed at which I did the above shopping is, I hope, symptomatic.

      I have written two thousand words on M a la Mode without yet using the notes I took at the Tate. Tomorrow I shall finish the chapter, using the notes so it should not take long. I think I am quite pleased  with it - Thank you, dearest, for your inspiration.

      Dilys Powell is at the Edinburgh Festival - apparently that is the reason I have not heard from her. Time and Tide have  sent me Shirley's new book about Constable to review - The Rainbow. Also in the post this morning (with your happily welcomed letter) was Arts News with the Italian Letter (with the Sironi well reporduced) and my review of Alazard's Florentine Portraits. (Denvir did Fame and Promise.)

      Gaisnsborough is also at Edinburgh so I cannot suggest the Poussin review to him till he comes back.

      I have heard from the Observer: Rose is away and his secretary thinks another reviewer has already asked for Clark's book - but the tone of the letter suggests I might get it when Rose comes back in September.

      Blackheath                     26 viii 1949

      Dearest Sylvia,

      I am glad your pen is still working. I have found your other one and I will send it off to you tomorrow.

      Yesterday I got your yard and a quarter for the autumn dress and ordered 2 and a quarter yards of the rococo pattern. I have resolved to be more prompt and decisive than, perhaps, I have been - writing to everybody, &c., and the speed at which I did the above shopping is, I hope, symptomatic.

      I have written two thousand works on M a la Mode without yet using the notes I took at the Tate. Tomorrow I shall finish the chapter, using the notes so it should not take long. I think I am quite pleased with it - thank you, dearest, for your inspiration.

      Dilys Powell is at the Edinburgh Festival - apparently that is the reason I have not heard from her. Time and Tied have sent me Shirley's new book about Constable to review - The Rainbow. Also in the post this morning (with your happily welcomed letter) was Art News with the Italian Letter (with the Sironi well reproduced) and my review of Alazard's Florentine Portraits. (Denvir did Fame and Promise.)

      Gainsborough is also at Edinburgh so I cannot suggest the Poussin review to him till he comes back.

      I have heard from the Observer: Rose is away and his secretary thinks another reviewer has already asked for Clark's book - but the tone of the letter suggests I might get it when Rose comes back in September.
