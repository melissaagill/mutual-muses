      28 VIII 1951
      Dearest Sylvia,
      I am sorry not to have written for
      a day or two but I have been very [unclear]busy[/unclear]
      writing.
      You have made a mistake about [unclear]B'heath[/unclear] -
      I go there tomorrow, Wednesday - and not
      Monday. I will let you know immediat-
      ely my impression of the interview - though I
      doubt if I shall know anything definite at
      once.
      I have gone very carefully through the Red-
      [unclear]ferm[/unclear] catalogues but I found nothing of yours
      there. I fear that you will not have
      been able to paint with your guests - but
      you must not allow either of these circum-
      stances to deter you.
      Yes, I have your watercolours from
      [unclear]Bourlets[/unclear] : you will rejoice to hear that
      magnificent cord, cardboards, & paper wrap-
      ped them up - so we are correspondingly
      enriched.
      Madeleine was most disappointed you
      could not come. She was very well and
      amusing but I was rather bored because
      a number of dullish people turned up. I
      kept thinking - if only Sylvia were here,
      how bright it would be.

      28  VIII 1951

      Dearest Sylvia,
      I am sorry not to have written for
      a day or two but I have been very busy
      writing.
      You have made a mistake about B'ram--
      I go there tomorrow, Wednesday--and not
      Monday.  I will let you know immediat-
      ely my impression of the interview--though I
      doubt if I shall know anything definite at
      once.
      I have gone very carefully through the Red-
      fer catalogue but I found nothing of yours
      there.  I fear that you will not have
      been able to paint with your guests--but
      you must not allow little of these circum-
      stances to deter you.
      Yes, I have your watercolours from
      Bourlet:  you will rejoice to hear that
      magnificent car, cardboard, and paper wrap-
      ped them up--so we are correspondingly
      enriched.
      Madeleine was most disappointed you
      could not come.  She was very well and
      amusing but I was rather bored because
      a number of dullish people turned up.  I
      kept thinking--if only Sylvia were here,
      how bright it would be.
