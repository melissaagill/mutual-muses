      Pett 1 8-6-52

      Dearest Lawrence,
      Thank you so much for sending
      the poems, I enjoy and advise
      them immensely.  I will write further
      on them to morrow as I want to
      catch the post, saying how much I
      love you and look forward to your
      coming.
      I worked on Clifford's legs yest-
      erday!  It is too windy to work
      out of doors so I am working or
      the GA.  This mornng I went
      in to Hastings and found a frame
      for my large still life.  I couldn't
      find the reading desk but will
      look again.
      Thank you again for the poems
