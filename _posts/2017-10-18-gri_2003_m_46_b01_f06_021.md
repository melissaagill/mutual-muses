      as nobody asked for it.  Try and check on this, however, in case you have to know.  Sorry not to have any precise information.  You do seem to be busy with [jam] just at present and I do hope that [D itchling] (have I it right?) will not be too dull, and that lunch with the stewarts was nice.  Robert Hart today gave me mixed grill and peaches and cream for tea at the Kerb, L'idiot a French film, then Roast Duck and meringue glacee for dinner.  It was a weel fed Dandy-lion who tumbled into bed to write this letter.

      I am glad Michael is happier now I have gone, But, how I miss you.  I should come back on the next train if it were possible - no matter how much his [calp] fell, nor how many colors he was able to turn. (You can tell he's a painter from this last gift.)
      Good for Tiny (0r, I mean, Mrs Wood, of course...) in that she appreciates your second oil of me.  Does she know it is to be a double portrait?  And you say Clifford wants to see your work.  Do let me know what he says.  Have you done much landscape yet? You say you hope to draw 'even in Italy?  I should think so too!  Don't forget your profession is on all the forms that you filled in during the war.  How I enjoyed
