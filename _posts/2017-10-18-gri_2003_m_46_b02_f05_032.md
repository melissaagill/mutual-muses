      Diptych For Sylvia

      Susannah and Narcissus
      Are the mythologists of mirrors,
      Water haunters, silver guides,
      To the body and its sequal.
      There is a mirror on the wall.
      Darling, I have made a choice.

      Pieta or odalisque,
      Jointed at wrist and hip and knee:
      Both recline in balanced poses,
      One in life and one in death.
      There is a bed for one to like.
      Darling, I have made a choice.

      Windows look both in and out
      Into day and into night:
      One way shows the vista and the hill,
      The other's bound by walks of bone.
      And, darling, I have made my choice,
      Your beauty, naked, in the sun.

      I love you, Lawrence
