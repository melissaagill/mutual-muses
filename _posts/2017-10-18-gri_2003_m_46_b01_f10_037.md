      creature but so, triumphantly your letter reveals, are you.  Yes I accept the

      I kono you love me, you have proved this darling, so do not fear for our life
      together. I would ask one thing - that our arrangements assume permanence and
      not simply a kind of experiment with the arrangements to be decided later. Provided
      we get on you can simply stay with me. We shall learn, as the lovers in Les

Yes, I accept the position you outline if it is necessary to you: for myself I am entirely confident. But I know what you are giving up to come to me whereas I leave nothing pleasant.

      I imagine our life like two pictures by David. There is the double portrait of the Lavoisiers, collaborating on the mutual interests, thoughtful and polite, and the Paris and Helen, a similar composition but with sexual tenderness the theme. The two taken together make and admirable synthesis.

      Thank you for working my lamp so well. I mean, of course, at the lecture but I seem inadvertently to have picked up the lantern held by Cupid again. This betrayal, however, is charming. Oh Sylvia I adore you.
      I long to speak to you tomorrow - that is Thursday. Give Tiny my love. I love you and long for the New Year.

      Dearest Sylvia,
      I have read your letter several times and thought about it all through breakfast. i remember you told me several times over the weekend that i was a reasonable creature but so, triumphantly your letter reveals, are you. yes i accept the position you outline if it is necessary to you: for myself I am entirely confident. But I know what you are giving up to come to me whereas I leave nothing pleasant. I know you love me, you have proved this darling, so do not fear our love life together. I would ask one not simply a kind of experiment with the arrangements to be decided later. Provided we get on you can simply stay with me. We shall learn, as the lovers in Les Jeux Sont Fait did not, that our allegiance is to each other.

      I imagine our life like two pictures by David. There is the double portrait of the Lavoisiers, collaborating on their mutual interests, thoughtful and polite, and the Paris and Helen, a similar composition but with sexual tenderness the theme. The two taken together make an admirable synthesis.

      Poor Mr Handley seems to be at the stage I was at last year when I wrote my autumn poem. I fear it is too late for him to find his way out, however, as I was able to by following a lantern held by Cupid which led to - Sylvia.

      I do hope that you have not [unclear]spoilt[/unclear]your picture of Michael. Today it is bright so perhaps you can correct it. How dark it has been as you say. In the B.M. it is like an [unclear]Elsheimer the chiaroscuro[/unclear] of the dome broken with tiny lonely reading lamps.

      Thank you for working my lantern so well. I mean, of course, at the lecture but i seem inadvertently to have picked up the lantern held by Cupid again. This betrayal, however, is charming. Oh Sylvia I adore you.

      I long to speak to you tomorrow - that is Thursday. Give Tiny my love. I love you and long for the New Year.

      I love you,
      Lawrence
