      Oh Sylvia,
      Your letter breaks my heart, when I think of your grief. Let me say, before writing another word, that my love for you has not diminished in any way whatsoever. Every meeting confirms the wonderful happiness I knew first last January, confirms and deepens. Oh, my dearest, believe in my love, as I believe in yours. If you had admitted me fully into your plan of 'not trying' Michael I should not have been so stupid. Remember, too, in extenuation, that your letters previously had been but frail bridges over the chasm between us. I want no-one but you: you had been a tiny bit callous about Michael's freedom to love you, and I was stung. Forgive me and be assured of my fidelity. My clumsiness on Monday does not discount all I have said in the past. I can sustain my love for you (I can do nothing else). Absence and parting may confuse us but they cannot untie our Gordian Knot anymore than we could ourselves. My idea of a lover was only an attempt, like yours, to reach a working compromise and I must confess that an even greater obstacle than your unhappiness is my own lack of appetite for another. I want none other. On the one hand there is the great love I bear you and on the other the need not to distress you too much by my demands which upset your life at Pett. This latter need has been eclipsed simply because we have not had even our minimum share of loving and I feel too fiercely. What you can reproach me with, perhaps justly, is loving you too much so that I have forgotten where your best interests lie as far as everyday living is concerned. And though I do understand the importance of your home (not less for lacking one of my own) I believe you will forgive me for my clumsiness. Clifford's letter recommended me not to make 'extreme demands' and I have always tried not to. But I am so glad that he endorses my suggestion off a fortnightly meeting as reasonable. I die to see you so we may both die. I will understand if it is impossible to see you before Bath (though you know what I hope, villian that I am), but the 30th is not desperately far away. Clifford recommends we be 'Realistic, reasonable, and patient'. I agree with him but believe we have a claim to meeting sometimes, that our desire creates difficulties I would not, and know now that you would not, have it reduced. My love is strong and I believe in the equality of our love. Lawrence

My clumsiness on Monday does not discount all I have said in the past. I can sustain my love for you (I can do nothing else). Absence and parting may confuse us but they cannot untie our Gordian Knot anymore than we could ourselves. My idea of a lover was only as attempt, like yours, to reach a working compromise and I must confess that an even greater obstacle than your unhappiness is my own lack of appetite for another. I want none other. On the one hand there is the great love I bear you and on the other the need not to distress you too much by my demands which upset your life at Pett. This later need has been eclipsed simply because we have not had even our minimum share of loving and I feel too fiercely. What you can reproach me with, perhaps justly, is loving you too much so that I have forgotten where your best interests lie as far as everyday living is concerned. And though I do understand the importance of a he your home (not less for lacking one of my own) I believe you will forgive me for my clumsiness. Clifford's letter recommended me not to make 'extreme demands' and I have always tried not to. But I am so glad that he endorses my suggestion of a fortnightly meeting as reasonable. i die to see you so we may both die. I will understand if it is impossible to see you before Bath (though you know what I hope, villain that I am), but the 30th is not desperately far away. Clifford recommends we be 'Realistic, reasonable and patient'. I agree with him but believe we have a claim to meeting sometimes, alone. I adore you, love you, and though I am aware that our desire creates difficulties I would not, and know now that would not, have it reduced. My love is strong and I believe in the equality of our love.
