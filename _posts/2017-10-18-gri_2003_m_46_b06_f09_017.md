      Sunday                           [13-9-53]
      Dearest Sylvia
      I had not realised until your last letter just how depressed you had been since M's visit. I suppose you will tell Georgie about the sit-uation if you feel you should. But why do you have to do it? She is M's mother, after all.
      I do hope though that this depression will have worn off. I hope that Tiny has helped and I am sure Diana will have. I'm afraid my pleasure in your paintings blinded me to the dark side of your letters. But I hope that, perhaps, being able to paint again (and I imagine paint well from your account) has made you feel better by now.
      Let me know how you feel. It makes me feel terribly protective when you are like this. I wish we were together. I am sorry you are not sleeping well: neither am I. I am - at present - that typically 20c figure- the insomniac lion. And, oh, you poor insom-niac cat.
      I have been offered more evening classes.

    annotation_text: "[13-9-53]\nSunday\n\nDearest Sylvia\n\nI had not realised until
      your last letter just how depressed you had been since M's visit. I suppose
      you will tell Georgie about the situation if you feel you should. But why do
      you have to do it? She is M's mother, after all.\nI do hope that this depression
      will have worn off. I hope that Tiny has helped and I am sure Diana will have.
      I'm afraid my pleasure in your paintings blinded me to the dark side of your
      letters. But I hope that, perhaps, being able to paint again (and I imagine
      paint well from your account) has made you feel better by now.\nLet me know
      how you feel. It makes me feel terribly protective when you are like this. I
      wish we were together. I am sorry you are not sleeping well: neither am I. I
      am - at present - that typically 2 Oc figure - the insomniac lion. And, oh,
      you poor insomniac cat.\n\nI have been offered more evening classes. "
