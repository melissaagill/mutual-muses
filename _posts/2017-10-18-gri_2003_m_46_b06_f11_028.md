      6 perty or nobody's. Magic is not transmissable. Formal means
      are transmissable.
      There are two kinds of statements about art that artists make.
      There are close personal statements whose referents lie away
      in the artist's work. There are also pedagogic statements
      (occasionally successful) in which the personal experience of
      the artist connects with impersonal matters. Some people re-
      gard the Sketchbook as a document permitting insight into Klee's
      art. Up to a point it does that, of coarse, but I have already
      mentioned important personal omissions. I might add, too, that
      the art of Klee's last period in the 1930s , is not contained by
      his statements. The Sketchbook is not a paraphrase of Klee's
      art, it is the outline of a method. The crucial point is to de-
      cide whether or not what Klee wrote in 1925 is still relevant.
      The Sketchbook is at the heart of 20c. ideas of space-time and I
      see no real evidence that motion-studies are being replaced by
      another art-form. That is to as an art-critic. From the
      point of view of art-education, I think that Klee's methods may
      still be potent, also: to replace the incoherent mixture of in-
      tuitives and academics in British art schools by Klee's compound
      of precision and adventurousness would be a public service.

      perty or nobody's. Magic is not transmissable. Formal means
      are transmissable.
      There are two kinds of statements about art that artists make.
      There are close personal statements whose referents lie away
      in the artist's work. There are also pedagogic statements
      (occassionally successful) in which personal experiences of
      the artist connects with impersonal matters. Some people re-
      gard the Sketchbook as a document permitting insight into Klec's
      art. Up to a point is does that, of course, but I have already
      mentioned important personal omissions. I might add, too, that
      the art of Klee's last period in the 1930s, is not contained by
      his statements. The Sketchbook is not a paraphrase of Klee's
      art, it is the cutline of a method. The crucial point is to de-
      cide whether or not what Klee wrote in 1925 is still relevant.
      The Sketchbook is at the heart of 20c. ideas of space-time and I
      see no real evidence that motion-studies are being replaced by
      another art-form. That is to as an art-critic. From the
      point of view of art-education, I think that Klee's methods may
      still be potent, also: to replace the incoherent mixture of in-
      tuitives and academics in British art schools by Klee's compound
      of precision and adventurousness would be a public service.
