         How is Giovanni Bellini progressing? I must say again how good I think it is.
         Yesterday I rang Beckett and must write to his publishers and send him a list of whatI want. I rang Antal but no answer.  Time and Tide I am writing to again today and Stephen Potter.
        The weather is rather oppressive.  The sun has come out now, it is about eleven and it very bright, so perhaps I can sunbathe and write this afternoon.
         This paper is part of the vast gift made to me by Paul.  I feel a madly professional writer now. (Yawolla i very pleased.)
         Last night I wrote this poem.  I imagined us both a hot and sleepless at irrespective windows:

        HOT NIGHT
      The kind of day is over
      When a globe of wool
      Flesh sacrificed its sweat:
      So with the thinnest cover
      Get ready for your sleep, pull
      The cover to your hips, or get
      Hot and nervous to the window.

      The day was damp and heavy
      That only now repairs
      The fever and the cloud's weight:
      Like someone rising from the sea,
      A beauty mounting stairs,
      A wind lifts a corner of the night
      To splash us in our windows.

      I must go and shop and then get on with my work.

      Darling Sylvia, I adore you and love you,
      Lawrence

      How is Giovanni Bellini progressing? I must say again how good I think it is.

      Yesterday I rang Beckett and must write to his publishers and send him a list of what I want. I rang Antal but no answer. Time and Time I am writing to again today and Stephen Potter.

      The weather is rather oppressive. The sun has come out now, it is about eleven and it very bright, so perhaps I can sunbathe and write this afternoon.

      This paper is part of the vast gift made to me by Paul. I feel a madly professional writer now. (Yawolla is very pleased.)

      Last night I wrote a poem. I imagined us both a hot and sleepless at our respective windows:

      HOT NIGHT

      The kind of day is over
      When in a globe of wool
      Flesh sacrificed its sweat:
      So with the thinnest cover
      Get ready for your sleep, pull
      The cover to your hips, or get
      Hot and nervous to the window.

      The day was damp and heavy

      Yesterday I rang Beckett and must write to his publishers and send him a list of what I want. I rang Antal but no answer. Time and Tide I am writing to again today and Stephen Potter.
      The weather is rather oppressive. The sun has come out now, it is about eleven and it very bright, so perhaps I can sunbath and write this afternoon.
      This paper is part of the vast gift made to me by Paul. I feel a madly professional writer now. (Yawolla is very pleased.)
      Last noght I wrote this poem. I imagined us both a hot and sleepless at our respective windows:

      HOT NIGHT
      The kind of day is over
      When in a globe of wool
      Flesh sacrificed its sweat:
      So with the thinnest cover
      Get ready for your sleep, pull
      The cover to your hips, or get
      Hot and nervous to the window.

      The day was damp and heavy
      That only now repairs
      The fever and the cloud's weight:
      Like someone rising from the sea,
      A beauty mounting stairs,
      A wind lifts a corner of the night
      To splash us in our windows.

      I must go and shop and then get on with my work.
      Darling Sylvia , I adore you and love you,
      Lawrence

      How is Giovanni Bellini progressing?  I must say again how good I think it is.
      Yesterday I rang Beckett and must write to his publishers and send him a list of what I want.  I rang Antal but no answer.  Time and Tide I am writing to again today and Stephen Potter.
