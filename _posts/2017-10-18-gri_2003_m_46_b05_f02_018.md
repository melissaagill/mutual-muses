      SEA
      THE SOCIETY FOR EDUCATION IN ART
      29 TAVISTOCK SQUARE LONDON WC 1

      Dearest Sylvia
      Thank you for your letters.
      I grieve that you cannot come un-
      til Saturday.  You will be able to
      stay longer tan after Tuesday, how-
      ever, if B'ham or The Arts Council
      pay me during the next week.  How
      urgently I hope they may.  It is
      quite possible I think in which case
      we shall have a longer time together.
      I will make all your appointments
      tomorrow and send you your time
      table for Monday.  I am free that
      day luckily.
      Today's lecture was a success I
      think:  Iris, Sutherland, Lawry, Paol-
      ozzi, Roent Adams, and Clockwich.  I
      gave Sutherland ENFER--you may be sure.

      SQUARE LONDON WC 1<br/>Dearest Sylvia<br/>Thank you for your letters.<br/>I
      grieve that you cannot come until Saturday.  You will be able to stay longer
      than after Tuesday, however, if B''ham or The Arts Council pay me during the
      next week.  How urgently I hope they may.  It is quite possible I think in which
      case we shall have a longer time together.<br/>I will make all your appointments
      tomorrow & send you you time table for Monday.  I am free that day luckily.<br/>Today''s
      lecture was a success I think:  Gris, Sutherland, Lawry, Paol,Ozzi, Robert Adams,
      & Chadwich.  I gave Sutherland ENFER - you may be sure.'
