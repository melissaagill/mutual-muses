      LYRICS FOR SYLVIA

      Making like forms in the surf
      Feathering on the plumed shore
      Virile and undefeating

      Sleeping like boats on gold grains
      Dry complacent silent
      But open to the sun

      Making like someone accused
      Of the language on the roof
      Mirror of the bridge of birds

      Sleeping vividly unconscious
      Like a milestone introducing
      Each vegetation god

      (ii)

      How many afternoons
      Survive the crystal wound
      Of pale light on the glass
      Lapped by the tongues of rain
      Implicitly contriving
      Waterfalls and figures
      Of Proteus, marine,
      Adaptable as sand

      The jet descends
      Onto bruising roofs of rock
      Spattering the sleepy trees:
      Like surf on the sea-edge
      The rain breaks
      On this horizon-coast

      (iii)

      Erudite as vases
      The flesh is normative:
      The evidence of roses
      Supposes pleasant guilt

      Behind the mask a mine
      And rubies on the table.
      As the mask confuses
      Be dazzled by the red

      Lazy as oracles
      I ay  my images
      While all the afternoons
      Lucifer falls like apples
      and Pan is rumoured dead

      Lapped by the tongues of rain
      Implicitly contriving
      Waterfalls and figures
      Of Proteus, marine,
      Adaptable as sand

      The jet descends
      Onto bruising roofs of rock
      Spattering the sleepy trees:
      Like surf on the sea-edge
      The rain breaks
      On this horizon-coast

      (iii)

      Erudite as vases
      The flesh ins normative:
      The evidence of roses
      Supposes pleasant guilt

      Behind the mask a mine
      And rubies on the table.
      As the mask confuses
      Be dazzled by the red

      lazy as oracles
      I say my images
      While all the afternoons
      Lucifer falls kile apples
      And an is romoured dead
