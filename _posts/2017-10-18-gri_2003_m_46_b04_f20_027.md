      Dearest Lawrence,

      I hope you will be successful in one of your interviews. Thank you for your kind letter. I hope you do not feel that I am [unclear]forering[/unclear] your hand - of course you may find yourself [unclear]in[/unclear] London just the same which would obviously be much [unclear]pleaseouter[/unclear] - but one cannot always choose.

      I have little or no news I have finished "The [unclear]Sphinx[/unclear]" and [unclear]of[/unclear] think it is very pleasing.

      The [unclear]Redbory[/unclear] is rather sad at present as Tiny's sister Doris (mother of Mary - Jane and Michael) is reported to have Leukemia which is fatal - Tiny went to see her yesterday - she is very weak and in pain -
