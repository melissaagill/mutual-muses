      2.
      the ration books and Hillyard. I'm so sorry to have taxed you with so many trying details when you were so busy.

      I'm very glad that you will be doing a review of Walton - and also that you spoke of films to Gainsbrough. I hope your Sirian lecture went well. I can understand your anxiety with so much to do - and appreciate your letter. I will paint as much as I can - but it is raining again to-day so I shall do my house-work so that I can paint when it is fine again. I shall use your book, mainly I hope to your advantage when you come.

      When Tiny has finished her lecture (to-day) she will sit for me, and I can also do illustrations and improve the big portrait if the weather continues bad; and also finish my article!

    clean_transcription: 2. The ration tooks and Willard.  I'm so sorry to have tared
      you with so many trying details when you were so busy.<br/>I'm very glad that
      you will be doing a review of Walton - and also that for spoke A films to Gawsboif.  I
      hope your Titian lecture went well.  I can well understand your anxiety with
      so much to do - and appreciate your letter- I will paint as much as I can -
      but it is raining again today.  So I shall do my house-work, so that I can paint
      when it is fine again.  I shall use your book, mainly I hope to your advantage
      when you come.<br/>When Tiny has finished her lecture (to-day) she will sit
      for me, and I am also do illustrators and improve the big portrait if the weather
      continues bad; and also finish my article!<br/>
