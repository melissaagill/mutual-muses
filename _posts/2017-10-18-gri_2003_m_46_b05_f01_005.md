      N.G. Wednesday Dearest Sylvia
      I think your choice of pictures for the S.E.A. was very good. I hope that we
      shall see them hanging soon.

      I miss you very much. I realise that life without you is impossible
      for me - depressing, chaotic, infuriating. I love you so dearly
      and long for our meeting. I adore your poem and you may be
      sure I had noticed the constrast of architecture in the Theatre' - I
      have not missed much in it I am sure for I have examined it with
      loving attention over and over again.

      A poem for my cat follows:
      'Let nothing happen to you'
      I said to the mirror's face

      Lovers go for mirrors when they're alone
      Narcissus wished for no one but himself
      But lovers watch themselves to remember
      The body that is loved by some one else
      When you see your image in the glass
      Love yourself as I do seeing you.

      'Let nothing happen to you'
      The face in the mirror said.

      I am having tea with CJ today & then I am attending a lecture for
      boys & girls given by Uncle Clare. This is just to observe his
      technique for I am lecturing on Velasquez in this series come
      Friday.
      The V & A library is closed for a week or so which means I have
      a problem in getting material for my 1st B'ham lecture. Erika
      (Hanover gal) has given me photo's of Delvaux & I am trying to
      contact the elusive E L T Mesens.

      Must close now or C J will come into his office and find me writing
      this (it being after 6:00).
      I love you
      Lawrence
