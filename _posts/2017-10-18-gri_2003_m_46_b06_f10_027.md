      Blackheath: 30 october 1953

      Dearest Sylvia:
      Thank you for your loving, heart-warming letter. It made
      me feel very happy. I am glad we shall at last be together
      all the time: I can't wait. I love you, dearest one, I
      love you.

      As I told you Dannatt is surveying the house Monday, 9.30.
      I had a letter from him this morning saying that 'in view
      of the fact that the house has been empty for a year we feel
      that the question of drainage should be investigated' and,
      therefore, one of the staff is going 'to inspect the Council's
      drainage plan and compare this with what he finds on the
      site'. Such thoroughness is encouraging, I feel.

      As you know, I have Goldsmith's this afternoon, after all. I
      have spent the morning writing and shall spend the evening the
      same way. Everyday a deadline:
      Monday: deadline of British Non-Figurative Art for Arti Visive.
      deadline of Portrait of Artist (Rene Magritte), Art News.
      Wednesday: deadline for Magritte exh. review for Art News.
      Friday: deadline for London letter for Art News (U.S.).
      (Also, lectures.)

      My cold is better, despite the terrible weather. It is pour-
      ing with rain as I write. I hope it slackens before I have to
      go out.

      Gimpels are not interested in John's work. Peter G had a look
      but will not do anything about it. Magda says he is very de-
      pressed by this.

      Yes, some news of the Travel Agent. Frank is 'on the verge' of
      starting work. It has been fermenting in his head all this
      time. He has ideas for it, Magda tells me.

      The discussion after the lecture at the ICA was worse than last
      time. The end. I said something but nothing could keep the
      discussion lucid last night. Nothing. Except perhaps a gun.
      I think Robert should be issued with a weapon.

      Well, I must shave before I go and award the prizes this after-
      noon. I love you, so much, my beauty. I think of you all
      the time and adore you all the time.
      I love you

      Blackheath: 30 October 1953

      Dearest Sylvia:

      Thank you for your loving, heart-warming letter. it made
      me feel very happy. I am glad we shall at last be together
      all the time: I can't wait. I love you, dearest one, I
      love you.

      As I told you Dannatt is surveying the house Monday, 9.30.
      I had a letter from him this morning saying that 'in view
      of the fact that the house has been empty for a year we feel
      that the question of drainage should be investigated' and,
      therefore, one of the staff is going 'to inspect the Council's
      drainage plan and compare this with what he finds on the
      site'. Such thoroughness is encouraging, I feel.

      As you know, I have Goldsmith's this afternoon, after all. I
      have spent the morning writing and shall spend the evening the
      same way. Everyday a deadline:
      Monday: deadline of British Non-Figurative Art for Arti Visive.
      deadline for Portrait of Artist (Rene Magritte), Art News.
      Wednesday: deadline for Magritte exh. review for Art News.
      Friday: deadline for London letter for Art News (U.S.).
      (Also, lectures.)

      My cold is better, despite the terrible weather. It is pour-
      ing with rain as I write. i hope it slackens before I have to
      go out.

      Gimpels are not interested in John's work. Peter G had a look
      but will not do anything about it. Magda says he is very de-
      pressed by this.

      Yes, some news of the Travel Agent. Frank is 'on the verge' of starting work. It has been fermenting in his head all this
      time. He has ideas for it, Magda tells me.

      The discussion after the lecture at the ICA was worse than last
      time. The end. I said something but nothing could keep the
      discussion lucid last night. Nothing. Except perhaps a gun.
      I think Robert should be issued with a weapon.

      Well, I must shave before I go and award the prizes this after-
      noon. I love you, so much, my beauty. I think of you all
      the time and adore you all the time.

      I love you
      Lawrence xxxxx
