      4.  think goin gby 'hoots' of unbridled
      laughter, for which we were almost
      personally thanked.
      Have you thought of anything for "Britt-
      ania and Eve" yet?
      When is your last Baustead lecture?
      Shall I be able to come to one?  You
      must tell me how your Tate lectures
      go.  I'm savaging on Thursday!
      I wonder what kind of dinner party
      you had with Mira and Richard.
      Poor F. Cordell.  I'm rather sorry for
      him.  I hope Magda is better now.
      I love you, my poet, your shape
      is ever before me elegant and master-
      ful!  You charming creature!
      I love you
