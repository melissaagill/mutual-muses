      Dearest Lawrence,

      I will finish this tomorrow when I get your letter - I have no time table for Charing Cross trains only Victoria - and it seems that none of the trains are at all convenient with the buses except the usual 10.10 to Charing X arriving 11.53. There is a 4.5 arriving Victoria at 6.4 which isn't too bad - I could either go straight to Charing Cross or pick you up at the Tate. Perhaps you will have some suggestions tomorrow.
