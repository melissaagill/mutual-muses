      STATUES IN THE GARDEN

      The woman stands who is a fountain
      And holds a shell, another lolls
      Against a hump-backed dolphin.
      Bronzed curly Neptune surmounts them
      all.

      Venus landed from a shell:
      Fangs of pollen grazed her thighs.
      Ceres, who weighed the world with fruit,
      Stands here now in stone, in stone.

      Behind these early characters,
      Their attributes and stories,
      Desire is hidden like a poet;

      Love was their motive and their fate
      Which lives again, not in the stone,
      But in our warm contemporary flesh.
