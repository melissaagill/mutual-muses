      Blackheath
      16 September

      Dearest Sylvia,
      I am overflowing with love and fondness for you and must write again. 'Lecture letters' were letters to the various people I am giving Arts Council Talks to, fixing up details about beds, dinners, lanterns. I have one or two more to write today.

      The cover, as well as the contents, of the Milton book is delightful. The floral borders are fine and delicate, on the central panel of a kind of wicker work. I am enchanted too at the slightly submarine quality of the green marbled end-papers and the frontispieces, which remind me of something Italian but I cannot think what. It is, all in all, a delight-ful acquisition for my library and Dandy is very proud of it: (Dandy is trying some contre jour effects.)

      My father sent a birthday card of a pik horse racing along with a rose in its mouth - treated as a gay flat pattern. I see it's designed by Hillary Stebbing. Mother sent an Emett called 'Strolling Players Giving their Public a Foretaste of their Performance." A sign tell us that they are the "Apollo Players".

      What a lyrical & rich variant of mythology of flowers  & owls & fruit is your 'birthday vignette'?

      (Dandy is trying some contre jour effects.)
      My father send a birthday card of a pink horse racing along with a

      16 September

      Dearest Sylvia,
         I am overflowing with love and fondness for you and must write again.  'lecture letters' were letters to the various people I am giving Arts Council Talks to, fixing up details about beds, dinners, lanterns.  I have one or two more to write today.
         The cover, as well as the contents, of the Milton book is delightful.  The floral borders are fine and delicate, as the central panel of a kind of wicker work.  I am enchanted too at the slightly submarine quality of the green marbled end-papers and at the frontispiece, which reminds me of something I believe but I cannot  think what.  It is, all in all, a delightful acquisition for my library and Dandy is very proud of it:  (Dandy is trying contre jour effects.)


         My father sent a birthday card of a pink horse racing along with a rose in its mouth - treated as a gay flat pattern.  I see it's designed by Hilary Stebbing.  Mother sent an Emmitt called 'Strolling Players giving their public a foretaste of their Performance'.  A sign tells us that they are the "Apollo Players."
         What a lyrical & rich variant of mythology and flowers & ows & fruit is your 'birthday vignette'?
