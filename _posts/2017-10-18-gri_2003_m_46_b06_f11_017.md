      I did my 2 lectures yesterday. It was rather tiring.
      I expect that is why I slept so late.

      It is 2.00. I shall go & post this letter, then have
      lunch (cheese, soup, fruit), and get on with my work.
      I can stay here all day: heaven. I shall have a
      bigger, hot meal tonight when I am not so fresh & don't
      mind breaking my trains of thought.

      I was so happy you slept well [unclear]rocks[/unclear] at Pett. I do
      hope this continues. I love & adore you.

      I love love love you
      Lawrence

      I did my 2 lectures yesterday.  It was rather tiring
      I expect that is why I slept so late.

      It is 2.00  I shall go & post this letter, then have
      lunch (cheese, soup, fruit), and get on with my work.
      I can stay here all day: heaven.  I shall have a
      bigger, hot meal tonight when I am not so fresh & don't
      mind breaking my trains of thought.

      I was so happy you slept well back at Pett.  I do
      hope this continues.  I love & adore you.

          love love love you
       Lawrence

      PS. My Pasmore article for the Architectural
      Review is now definite, by the way.
