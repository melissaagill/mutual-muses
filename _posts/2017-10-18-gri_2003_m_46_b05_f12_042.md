      The early sunset is an hour ahead
      of time as dark clouds cross
      The baldachins of the throne we dodge
      Calling the earth all year.

      That monster we sacrifice and eat.
      Of that body we are never replete.

      A lion like the sun
      A lion like the cloud
      Can be seen
      In the Christmas sky.

      IV

      If I knew the name of all fruits
      I would flemish you with them
      and bury them
      So more would come, as from roots.

      Hear me out
      I'm a landscape without leaves.
      I can tell you all I believe
      Of new year in and old year's out:

      I loved you all this year
      I love you all the next
      Words are sexed
      That describe you, far or near.

      I have eaten a bird
      I cannot fly.
      As the lion flies
      I would soon be there.
