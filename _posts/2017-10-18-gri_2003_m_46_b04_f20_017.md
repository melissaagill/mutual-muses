      Pett             15 . 8 . 51

      Dearest Lawrence,
         I am delighted by the new 'Athene' and very much look forward to reading it.  But I am bitterly disappointed by the rest of your letter.  The only thing that keeps us apart now is your lack of money and I cannot see how you are really going to deal with the difficulties.  If you do not think I am worth getting a job for I shall quite understand but please say so quite frankly for if you go on as you are going you will soon be living at home again.  You know very well you usually get a nice lot of lectures in the autumn and are on the bread line from April to September

      Lawrence,<br/>        I am delighted by the new<br/>'Althene' and very much
      look<br/>forward to reading it. But I am<br/>bitterly disappointed by the rest<br/>of
      your letter.  The only thing that<br/>keeps us apart now is your lack<br/>of
      money and I cannot see<br/>how you are really going to deal<br/>with the difficulties.  If
      you do<br/>not think I am worth getting a<br/>job for I shall quite understand<br/>but
      please say so quite frankly<br/>for if you go on as you are<br/>going you will
      soon be living<br/>at home again.  You know very<br/>well you usually get a
      nice<br/>lot of lectures in the autumn<br/>and are on the bread line from<br/>April
      to September
