      official buff one I had before.
      I have adapted the Sleeping Beauty
      story for our purposes. Seven lines
      show you asleep and seven lines your
      awakening. One Northern and one South-
      ern stanza.

      The dust made deserts in the loggia
      The tournament was Medusa-still
      Swans lay toppled silent on the glass
      The courtiers the jester and the cooks
      Were dead as the locked and silent foun-
      tains.
      She lay in a hall of silver tapestries
      Statuesque for a century.

      Then morning made roses in the sky
      Melted the icicles of the fountains
      A kiss revived the slumbering lady
      And birds flew from the billowing tap-
      estries
      The tournament rattled gaily in the tilt-
      yard
      And she walked forward from the dark
      dream
      On the arm of love preceded by pearls
      and torches.

      I love you, Sylvia, I love you. Do
      write me whenever you can without up-
      setting the fragile situation at Pett.

      Does Tiny want any garlic?
