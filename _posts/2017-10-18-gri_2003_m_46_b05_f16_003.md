      3.
      I am so glad that your lecture went so well in spite of the weather it sounds extremely good - I would love to have heard it. You're a wonderful creature.
      I do look forward to your reading me articles form the I.J.P.A - but I expect you will have read them all by then! However do save it for me.
      Clifford is having rather a bad time ecclesiastically speaking! It being the week before Holy week there seem to be endless services. He's a bit more vested. Tiny is quite gay, and yesterday chaired a public meeting (annual) of The Parish Council.
      Thank you for the lovely pictures of the H of L Boat race - what a splendid conclusion!

      of the weather.<br/>It sounds extremely good - I would<br/>love to have heard
      it. You're a wonder-<br/>ful creature.<br/>I do look forward to your reading<br/>me
      articles from the I.J.P.A. - but <br/>I expect you will have read them<br/>all
      by then! However do save it<br/>for me.<br/>Clifford is having rather a bad<br/>time
      ecclesiastically speaking! It<br/>being the week before Holy week<br/>there
      seem to be endless services.<br/>He's a bit more rested. Tiny is<br/>quite gay;
      and yesterday most<br/>charmingly and efficiently chaired<br/>a public meeting
      (annual) of<br/>the Pasist Council.<br/>Thank you for the lovely pictures<br/>of
