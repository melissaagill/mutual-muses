      2 here alone. For it is much worse
      than being alone to feel excluded
      for although there is no hope of her
      recovery she is better and is going
      home., - I think it is probable
      that TIny will take on Mary-Jane
      and Jack and Michael for Christ-
      mas - and M. - J for all the
      holidays. A pity she is not a
      more attractive child - She is so
      snug, sly, and mean! I [unclear]cannot[/unclear] say
      I prefer Carol. It is more and
      more born in on me, to my sorrows,
      that it does not matter how beloved
      one is as a friend, directly there
      is any case of family one takes
      very second place.  That's one
      reason I think why I have clung
      to Michael - he is my family.
      Though I think with art you I should
      have been dead long ago - at least
      to a positive life. You mean so

      here alone. For it is much worse than being alone to feel excluded. And now that Doris is dying - for although there is no hope of her recovering she is better and is going home, - I think it is probable that [unclear]Tiny[/unclear] will take on Mary-Jane and Jack and Michael for Christ-mas - and M-J for all the holidays. A pity she is not a more attractive child - she is so smug, sly, and mean! I must say I prefer Carol. It is more and more borne in on me, to my sorrow, that it does not matter how beloved one is as a friend, directly there is any case of family one takes very second place. That's one reason I think why I have clung to Michael - he is my family. Though I think without you I should have been dead long ago - at least to a positive life. You mean so
