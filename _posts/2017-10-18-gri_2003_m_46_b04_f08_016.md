      I long to see you soon. Oh my wonder, my rose. But for your
      paintings I should be desolate indeed. Their audacious rhythms
      and treasures of colour are trophies of your conquests in the barb-

      lieve in my love, especially as the landscape recovers from
      Winter. Spring is our time. you may share it only with Tiny on
      your long walks with her.
      I love you, I love you
