      There is the doric tall house
      On the bridge above the river
      Where I rowed another summer:
      The river is what it was then -
      Sluggish, picturesque, & cool.

      The muses of topography
      Are hamadryads & river-gods:
      Though no oracle inhales the steam,
      Yet, superstitious classicist,
      I count the toga and the laurel.

      Tender fallacies in the contour
      of the landscape and the city:
      Emperors posed against the tower
      of 'the lantern of the West'.
      Mostly it is Minerva I mind,

      In marble bust and local lore.

      I think of you all the while, as my poem tries to show. Do
      think of me. I shall soon be back.
      I love you so much & rejoice, may I say it once more,
      in the Redfern success. I hope Mrs. Taft is nice this after-
      noon
      I adore you
      Lawrence

      There is the doric tall house
      On the bridge above the river
      Where I sowed another summer:
      The river is what it was then
      Sluggish, picturesque, & cool.
      The muses of topography
      Are [unclear] lamadryads[/unclear] & river-gods:
      Thou no oracle inhales the steam,
      Let, superstitious classicist,
      I count the toga and the laurel.
      Tender fallacies in the contour
      Of the landscape and the city:
      Emperors posed against the tower
      Of 'the lantern of the West'
      Mostly it is Minerva I mind
      In marble bust and local lore
      I think of you all the while, as my poem tries to show. Do think of me. I shall soon be back.
      I love you so much & rejoice, may I say it once more, in the Redfern success. I hope Mrs. Taft is nice this afternoon.
      I adore you
      Lawrence
