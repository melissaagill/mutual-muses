      Dearest Sylvia
      I have phone Danvatt again without catching him in. I will
      try again today and let you know the appointment I am
      able to fix up with him.
      Thank you so much for the Conan Doyle book. I have already
      rea the Holmes' chapter - to my very great advantage. I
      look forward to reading the rest in the near future when I am
      less rushed.
      I shall see you in 6 days. I am so impatient for our meeting.
      I love you so much, darling love.
      I quite agree and understand about your feelings when
      we are separated. Thank you for explaining them. I feel
      the same way. Thank heavens that in a few weeks this
      problem will be finally disposed of. Then we shall be together
      all the time.
      Your cuttings from The Time interested me: thank you for being
      so considerable in sending them to me.
      I have to see many scho. at present: that - and my lectures - gives me a
      feeling of being perpetually rushed. That is the surface of
      my last week or 2 at Blackheath, waiting for you & new home, make me terribly restless. Oh I want you, darling.

      Harpedon went quite well. Today it is Banstead again, oh
      that journey in rotten weather!
      Father is going into hospital tomorrow & the operation will take
      place on Friday.
      Take care of yourself. Remember how I adore you.

      I love you
      Lawrence
