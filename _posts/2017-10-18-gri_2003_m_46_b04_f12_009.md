      Habit puts tears where fountains rise,
      Mistaking water as the signs
      Of buried grief: tho' fountains rear
      In phallic power delayed by gravity.

      Time conjures tears from eyes that see
      The fountains' tensions, & forget
      These cheeks are wet for early pains
      & not for fountains in the shapes of lions.

      I will tell you in a letter tomorrow the exact time I shall arrive. Anyway it will be on the afternoon coach. (One of my slides is T-L's poster for La Revue Blanche, by the way.) I have an excellent selection of slides, too, I am glad to say.
      Now, for Hetty's sake, stop being neurotic - be yourself. You are beautiful, adorable, gifted, brilliant. Why should you waste time with depressing poses (that is all they are)? I adore you, I adore you. Soon, soon I shall see you.
                       I love you
                       Lawrence

      Habit puts tears where fountains rise,
      Mistaking water as the signs
      of buried grief: the fountains near
      In [unclear][/unclear] power delayed by gravity.

      Time conjures tears from eyes that see
      The fountains tension, and forget
      These cheeks are wet for early pains
      as not for fountains in the slopes of lions.

      I will tell you in a letter tomorrow the exact time I shall arrive. Anyway it will be on the afternoon coach. (One of my slides is T-L's parts for la Nerve Blanch, by the way.) I have an excellent selection of slides, too, I am glad to say.

      Now, for Hetty's sake, stop being neurotic - be yourself. You are beautiful, adorable, gifted, brilliant. Why should you waste time with depressing pose (that is all they are)?

      I adore you, I adore you. Soon, soon I shall see you.

      I love you
      Lawrence
