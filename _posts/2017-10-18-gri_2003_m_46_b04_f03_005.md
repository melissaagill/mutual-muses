      Blackheath
      [unclear]13[/unclear] iii 1952
      Dearest Sylvia,
      I wish you were here. In lieu of that pleasure,
      however, I hope that your journey back was bearable
      and that Pett is not hostile or worrying to you.
      Do remember that you should paint, if possible.

      I wonder what you are doing today. Look after
      your hands, my beauty. Perhaps I should have sent
      Hetty with you, after all, to see to your hands.
      I hope you are having terribly long talks with
      Tiny in the kitchen: that always sounds most fun.

      Today I am meeting Ithell at the Hanover and,
      apparently, in the evening she is taking me to some-
      thing or other, I don't know what, at the I.C.A.

      Tell C. I hope to have his books for him in a
      day or so: and if he can remember the name of the
      couple who erratically corresponded I should be glad.

      Charles has invited me to a party at Roland, Browse,
      &c. but unhappily I have to be at Banstead. Still,
      as Hetty says, probably there would not have been
      any dancing... and that is all Dandy wants nowadays.

      Do not worry about exhibitions. I have them all
      clear in my tete. Let me know what you arrange about
      the Poet in the Garden: I will gladly meet a bus
      with it on if you are not coming up yet. I wonder
      if you have heard yet from the R.I. and New English.

      I love you, my dearest cat, angelic muse, and I
      hope you feel my adoration despite the Euclidean
      distance between us. Be assured of my desire and love.

      I love you
      Lawrence

      Blackheath
      13 iii 1951

      Dearest Sylvia,

      I wish you were here. In lieu of that pleasure, however, I hope that your journey back was bearable and that Pett is not hostile or worrying to you. Do remember that you should paint. if possible.

      I wonder what you are doing today. Look after your hands, my beauty. Perhaps I should have sent Hetty with you , after all, to see to your hands. I hope you are having terribly long talks with Tiny in the kitchen: that always sounds most fun.

      Today I am Meeting Ithell at the Hanover and, apparently, in the evening she is taking me to some-thing-or-other, I don't know what, at the I.C.A.

      Tell C. I hope to have his books for him in a day or so: and if he can remember the name of the couple who erotically corresponded I should be glad.

      Charles has invited me to a party at Roland, Browse, &c. but unhappily I have to be at Banstead. Still, as Hetty says, Probably there would not have been any dancing... and that is all Dandy wants nowadays.

      Do not worry about exhibitions. I have them all clear in my tete. Let me know what you arrange about the Poet in the Garden: I will gladly meet a bus with it on if you are not coming up yet. I wonder if you have heard yet from the R.I. and New English.

      I love you, my dearest cat, angelic muse, and I hope you feel my adoration despite of the Euclidean distance between us. Be assured of my desire and love.

      I love you
      Lawrence
