      Putti painted on playing cards
      Ambush Venus from the tree
      Of the nine of clubs and win
      The apple from the gambling goddess.

      The suits of the game are five,
      One for every sense.
      Putti in spectacles ponder
      Telescopes & books.

      Roses enchant the nostrils,
      And enter delay the ear;
      Grapes spill over the past-board,
      & breasts cagole the touch.

      Putti dressed as chinamen
      Hide aces in their sleeves:
      Putti set fire to the puritan's coat
      & chase him out of town

      Owls carry off an emblem,
      Making the two of hearts the Ace.
      Minerna is winning the evening,
      Owls flying off with each trick.

      You have won all my poems;
      Here are the deeds of the farm.
      My clothes are part of the stake.
      But, naked, I'll keep you warm?

      Beside the gaming characters

      [unclear][/unclear][unclear][/unclear] painted on playing cards
      Ambush Venus from the tree
      of the nine of clubs and win
      The apple from the gambling goddess

      The [unclear][/unclear] of the game are fine;
      One for every sense.
      [unclear][/unclear] in spectacles ponder
      Telescopes and books.

      Roses enchant the nostrils,
      and lutes delay the ear;
      Grapes spill over the paste-board,
      & breasts cagole the touch.

      [unclear][/unclear] dressed as chinamen
      hide aces in their sleeves:
      [unclear][/unclear] set fire to the puritan's coat
      & chase him out of [unclear][/unclear].

      Owls carry off an emblem,
      making the two of hearts the Ace.
      Minerva is winning the evening,
      owls flying off with each trick.

      'You have won all my poems;
      Mine are the deeds of the farm.
      my clothes are part of the stake.
      But, naked, I'll keep you warm?

      Beside the gaming characters
      other loves play the lute and sing
      Songs whose nonsense was composed
      By the bohemian [unclear][/unclear] of our games.
