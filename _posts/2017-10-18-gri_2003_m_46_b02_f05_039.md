      is best to go to Colmar on the way back for it is much nearer Italy than England. Therefore we can reach it comfortably from Venice. So, since we obviously must break the journey some-where, we should spend one night in Paris. Otherwise we shall be exhausted when we reach Milan.

      Charles was pleasant and I have bought ten thousand lire from him which is useful.

      Alas my shirt, which Lionel said was smart, proved to be not quite large enough so I took it back to discover Cecil Gee had nothing larg-er nor any nice shirt I wanted. So I think I shall buy one in Italy unless I find something else here: I've had a long look which is quite fruitless, so far.

      I think I shall come on Friday on a train that leaves Charing Cross at 8.25 and gets in to Hastings at 10.47. If this is not conven-ient let me know and I'll change it. If you are not at the station by the time I get there I will walk down to the bus stop on the front and wait for you there. That is, unless a letter from you contains other instructions in which case I shall follow them.

      I will bring a suitcase to be filled up. Yawolla will be with me so if there are any parcels as well as the things for the suitcase we shall be able to take care of them. Bring as much as you can in short.

      is best to go to Colmar on the way back for it is much nearer Italy than England.  Therefore we can reach it comfortably from Venice.  So, since we obviously must break the journey somewhere, we should spend  one night in Paris. Otherwise we shall be exhausted when we reach Milan.

          Charles was pleasant and I have bought ten thousand lire from him which is useful.

          Alas my shirt, which Lionel said was smart, proved to be not quite large enough so I took it back to discover Cecil Gee had nothing larger nor any nice shirt I wanted.  So I think I shall buy one in Italy unless I find something else here:  I've had a long look which is quite fruitless, so far.

          I think I shall come on Friday on a train that leaves Charing Cross at 8.25 and gets in to Hastings at 10.47.  If tis is not convenient let me know and I'll change it.  If you are not at the station by the time I get there I will walk down to the bus stop on the front and wait for you there.  That is, unless a letter from you contains other instructions in which case i shall follow them.

          I will bring a suitcase to be filled up.  Yawolla will be with me so if there are any parcels as well as the things for the suitcase we shall be able to take care of them.  Bring as much as you can in short.
