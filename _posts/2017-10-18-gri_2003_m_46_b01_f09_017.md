      11th October 1948                Wimbledon

      Dearest Sylvia,

      What a shame Michael returned when he did. However I [unclear]must[/unclear] finish what I was saying on the phone. I started to say that I depended on you entirely. Then I thought of the excessive demands Michael had been making on you and I feared to renew your emotional exhaustion. So I put it in a way which still expressed my love but which did not put you under an obligation. But let me repeat: you are my motive for working as I am now and that is a practical sign of the love I have for you. Of its more intimate expressions I need not speak, in relation to the book.

      Oh the pleasure of hearing your voice three times on the phone today. It is too much and it stimulates me to write, though hasitly, this note to you my dearest.

      You are a lovely creature. Yesterday, even as we stung each other, I was aware of your beauty and admiring the way you tipped your head to look at a picture and your delicious profile was posed against a 'golden master'. And lots more. I adore you. It is so important our love: consider how, when we are alone together, we defeat Time. No, not defeat Time, that is too strong an action. We exclude him simply by our concentration on each other. Indifference to time is the way. And your beauty vanquishes time wholly for me so that I am left delighted, delighting in you.

      Enchantress, lover, Minerva, painter, I adore you.

      I must have tea and get back to work. I shall post this now. By the way, would you after all let me have the Burlington magazine money: it is only 19s. You can make it, as Charles would say, 18s. 9d, as you have put aside a threepenny piece for me. Thank you for remembering that, it is charming of you.

      I love you, love you, and live only for signals from you (the ringing of bells) and, best of all, our Wednesday meeting. O darling I am mad for you.

      Lawrence

      Dearest Sylvia,

      What a shame Michael returned when he did.  However I must finish what I was saying on the phone.  I started to say that I depended on you entirely.  Then I thought of the excessive demands Michael had been making on you and I feared to renew your emotional exhaustion.  So I put it in a way which still expressed my love but which did not put you under an obligation.  But let me repeat:  you are my motive for working as I am now and that is a practical sign of the love I have for you.  Of its more intimate expressions I need not speak, in relation to the book.

      Oh the pleasure of hearing your voice three times on the phone today.  It is too much and it stimulates me to write, though hastily, this note to you my dearest.

      You are a lovely creature.  Yesterday, even as we stung each other, I was aware of your beauty and admiring the way you tipped your head to look at a picture and your delicious profile was posed against a "golden master".  And lots more.  I adore you.  It is so important our love;  consider how, when we are alone together, we defeat Time.  No, not defeat Time, that is too strong an action.  We exclude him simply by our concentration on each other.  Indifference to time is the way.  And your beauty vanquishes time wholly for me so that I am left delighted, delighting, in you.

      Enchantress, lover, Minerva, painter, I adore you.

      I must have tea and get back to work.  I shall post this now.  By the way, would you after all let me have the Burlington magazine money;  it is only 19s.  You can make, as Charles would say, 18s.  9d, as  you have put aside a three penny piece for me.  Thank you for remembering that, it is charming of you.

      I love you, love you, and live only for signals from you (the ringing of bells) and, best of all, our Wednesday meeting.  O darling I am mad for you.

      Lawrence
