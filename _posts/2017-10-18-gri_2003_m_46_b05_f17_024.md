      3. frame is a bit groggy in that it chips easily.So perhaps you could wrap it in newspaper separately. Apparently they will take stuff any day this week.
      The garden is fine - I manured and finished the trence and hope to put the tomatoes in this evening; they are very well - so is everything. The grass has grown amazingly and so have the weeds -taller than me in the paddock but the vegetables haven't gown much for lack of rain.
      I hope Clifford will have time to sit this afternoon its a lovely day I hope you can do some work in the gardne. Come early on Friday! I long to see you and miss you so much I am so happy to think
