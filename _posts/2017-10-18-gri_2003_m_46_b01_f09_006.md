      11 Mansel Road
      Wimbeldon
      6th October 1948
      Dearest Sylvia,
      Beleaguered as we are
      By miles of cubist roof top
      And great allegiances
      We are not separated
      For the heart still knows desire
      The lips tremble as for a kiss
      The hand is ready to paint
      what it cannot paint alone
      And the future waits for us

      I know that absence is not on our side but in my  poem I
      have tried to record some victories over it. Do
      you find, as you used to, that parting works against the
      one you are separated from? If so it is a sign of your
      fine love that you love me still. I believe in your love
      - you know that - and long for an expression of it when not
      pitted against dangers and difficulties. I have a two -
      fold longing - that you can be tranquil again and
      that I can give you my love daily, a love you need, I
      believe, not less than I need to give it to you.

      ON THE BUS -
      I tried to finish this letter on the bus but with hopeless
      results. I shall write to you this evening. I love you,
      Sylvia, very much. Now I must fly to see Beckett.
      Oh my dearest, I adore you.
      Lawrence
