      Dearest Lawrence,

      I am not surprised to hear the news about the N.G. Post - for if you had been successful you would have heard before this.  I think that you may well console yourself that you are on the short list, but what you need now is a little influence and to be even better known - I hope Hogarth will be out soon - have you heard anything more?

      Yes, I know Hockleys by sight very well - Granny had stayed there before I was born I think - she always said that it was very nice every time we passed it!
