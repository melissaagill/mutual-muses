      Blackheath 23 x ii 1949
      Dearest Sylvia,

      Here is a poem for you, not, I am afraid, any of the ones we discussed but another about The Five Senses.  You know yourself how sometimes when one sets out to create something one holds consciously in mind, something else is easier for the moment. So it was with this poem, but I am gathering the images, the words, for the other poems and I hope, over Christmas, to be able to send you some more. The Figureheads poem in particular is shaping well but it is rather critical of the masses rather than appreciative of love and poetry - so it is not a suitable seasonal gift.  I hope that this new poem (all riming except the envoi!) will convey my good-will, my love, and my appreciation of experiences we have shared which provide the imagery of it.
      I have received a letter from Worsley (literary Editor of the Statesman) in which he says my review is 'written with skill and with knowledge' but he feels it is not suitable for the New Statesman as it is rather specialised. However, this is not as gloomy as it sounds because he says to ring him up and go and have a talk with him about it.  There is, still, I like to think hope.
      I have not yet received any letters from you but, then, the posts are quite phantastic at present. One at ten, another at ten-thirty, then a prolonged silence. I hope you get mine fairly regularly.
      Yesterday I got a shirt, not a grey and white bengal stripe, but a pale brown and white:  it was the only kind I was able to find.  I thin it is rather niece and will look delicious with my new bow, which it will show up to great advantage.

      Blackheath   23 xii 1949
      Dearest Sylvia,
      Here is a poem for you, not, I'm afraid, any of the ones we discussed but another about The Five Senses.  You know yourself how sometimes when one sets out to create something one holds consciously in mind, something else is easier for the moment. So it was with this poem, but I am gathering the images, the words, for the other poems and I hope, over Christmas, to be able to send you some more. The Figureheads poem in particular is shaping well but it is rather critical of the masses rather than appreciative of love and poetry - so it is not a suitable seasonal gift.  I hope that this new poem (all riming except the envoi!) will convey my good-will, my love, and my appreciation of experiences we have shared which provide the imagery of it.

      I have received a letter from Worsley (literary Editor of the Statesman) in which he says my review is 'written with skill and with knowledge' but he feels it is not suitable for the New Statesman as it is rather specialised. However, this is not as gloomy as it sounds because he says to ring him up and go and have a talk with him about it.  There is still, I like to think hope.

      I have not yet received any letters from you but, then, the posts are quite phantastic at present. One at ten, another at ten-thirty, then a prolonged silence.  I hope you get mine fairly regularly.

      Yesterday I got a shirt, not a grey and white bengal stripe, but a pale brown and white: it was the only kind I was able to find.  I think it is rather nice and will look delicious with my new bow, which it will show up to great advantage.
