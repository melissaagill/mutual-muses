      I like all the fragments you have sent
      me save the 1st.  Speaking of Kingless-
      ness -- "Tom Thumb" shook his head
      very doubtfully and said "Three Queens!
      as though it were rather onions!  Of
      [unclear]course[/unclear] [unclear]they[/unclear] are all Morgan la Fee!
          Thank you so much for making in-
      quiries  for me.  I hope perhaps you have
      managed to make appointments with the

      want to leave pictures at the [unclear] Lege[/unclear]
      as I have to deliver [unclear]Mme Bergmans![/unclear]

      have started the other still-life with

      I am just finishing the curtain and

Specially of Kniplessness - "Tom [unclear]Snimt[/unclear]" shook his head very doubt fully and said "[unclear]three[/unclear] Queens"! as though it were rather [unclear]onuinons[/unclear]! Of can use the  [unclear]all[/unclear] all Morgan La Fée !
           Thank you so much for [unclear]malty[/unclear] in-quiries for me. I hope perphaps you have managed to make appointments [unclear]voilt [/unclear]the [unclear]Liceester[/unclear] and Kensington. I dont want to leave pictures at the Lege as I have to deliver [unclear]nine Bergmane[/unclear]!
