      I hope that the portrait of Ruth will be dry enough to bring. Could you, also, bring a towel - the wretched laundry has both mine at present unfortunately (Yawalla, of course, does not miss them in the least). If you have more things than you can conveniently carry you could always send a parcel ahead of you.
      Mr Smith of Bonstead - hearing I was in Shepherds' Bush -came over Monday evening and studied all the pictures in great detail.
      I am so glad that you look forward to painting some more of Hetty - she longs to pose for you, you may take a lion's word for it.
      I love you, my sweetheart, and look forward so much to Saturday
      I love you
      Lawrence
      P.S. The N S & N have sent me, now, Beckett's catalogue of Hogarth's paintings - which is admirable, especially with regard to illustrations. (Getting it to review saves me 3 guineas.)
      I love you
