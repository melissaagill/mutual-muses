      weekend--Saturday lunch to

      was in a frightful state about
      it but she didn't want to
      refuse them as they aren't coming
      for Christmas.  She's very apol-
      ogetic.
      It's a dreadful day, I've
      been writing letters most of the
      time, what a lot of time is
      wasted by there annoying neces-
      sities.
      Clifford is coming to your lect-
      ure.  He will be in Hasttings
      for a Synod.  Perhaps he would
      meet you.  Anyway I shall
      have to come in on the 5.20 from Pett
      so could you meet the bus?
      or if you are in after that I
      will meet the train.  I feel
      if you are not at the bus
      stop I will go up to the
      station.  I love you.
