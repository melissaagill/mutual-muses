      in the porch, of the 12 Apostles.
      In Oxford - it was rather a flying visit, there is so much to see, and by 4 [unclear]hours[/unclear] we were very tired and still had 4 colleges to see. I fear I don't remember as well as I should what I saw but I was very impressed and remember Inigo Jones Gate and some lovely statues of my dear Charles!
      Michael is thinking of starting a business and is looking round here to see possibilities - it is all very tentative. It is a town of great charm.
      I wonder how you and Robert got on on Tuesday - I have an old landscape that I think I may bring for him to hang up when visitors come - I don't know anything about it - but it might amuse you.
      My dearest Howe arrived safely [unclear]woods[/unclear] in very good form
      I love you
      Sylvia
