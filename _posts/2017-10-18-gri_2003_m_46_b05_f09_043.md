    annotation_text: 'Jerome Bosch is an artist preoccupied with sexual symbolism.
      The intentional meaning is often of great complexity but that is not our concern
      at present, though it is of interest to note that an alchemical doctrine with
      which he was bound to have been familiar assumed the sexual basis of all matter.
      He is one of those religious artists who consider the universe as a place of
      distraction, illusion, and peril - possibly even the creation of the Devil.
      His animistic sense of a landscape which nourishes monsters is related, not
      to rational thought, but is an image of early childhood before the differentiation
      of the self from the external world is achieved. Desire and guilt are mingled
      in S. Jerome at Prayer, ca   (Ghent); although the S, is seen at prayer Bosch
      lavishes extraordinary care on the landscape. The ground itself is organic,
      reminiscent of phantasies of the creative properties of excrement. I do not
      want to relate this pervasive sexuality in Bosch''s art to a particular event
      or feature of his life: it is sufficient at present if I can persuade you that
      the spectators of works of art, ourselves, deny an essential element in art
      by avoiding the recognition of sexual content.'

      Jerome Bosch is an artist preoccupied with sexual symbolism.
      The intentional meaning is often of great complexity but that
      is not our concern at present, though it is of interest to note
      that an alchemical doctrine with which he was bound to have been
      familiar assumed the sexual basis of all matter. He is one of
      those religious artists who consider the universe as a place of
      distraction, illusion, and peril - possibly even the creation of
      the Devil. His animistic sense of a landscape which nourishes
      monsters is related, not to rational thought, but is an image of
      early childhood before the differentiation of the self from the
      external world is achieved. Desire and guilt are mingled in S.
      Jerome at Prayer, ca (Chent); although the S. is seen at
      prayer Bosch lavishes extraordinary care on the landscape, which
      is riddled with crifices, distrubed with phallic growths. The
      ground itself is organic, reminiscent of phantasies of the crea-
      tive properties of excrement. I do not want to relate this per-
      vasive sexuality in Bosch's art to a particular event or feature

      Jerome Bosch is an artist with sexual symbolism.
      The intentional meaning is often of great complexity but that
      is not our concern at present, though it is of interest to note
      that an alchemical doctrine with which he was bound to have been
      familiar assumed the sexual basis of all matter. He is one of
      those religious artists who consider the universe as a place of
      distraction, illusion, and peril - possibly even the creation of
      the Devil. His animistic sense of a landscape which nourishes
      monsters is related, not to rational thought, but is an image of
      early childhood before the differentiation of the self from the
      external world is achieved. Desire and guilt are mingled in S.
      Jerome at Prayer, ca (Ghent); although the S. is seen at
      prayer Bosch lavishes extraordinary care on the landscape, which
      is riddled with orifices, disturbed with phallic growths. The
      ground itself is organic, reminiscent of phantasies of the crea-
      tive properties of excrement. I do not want to relate this per-
      vasive sexuality in Bosch's art to a particular event or feature
      of his life: it is sufficient at present if I can persuade you
      that the spectators of works of art, ourselves, deny any essential
      element in art by avoiding the recognition of sexual content.
