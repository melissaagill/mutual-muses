                            For Sylvia

      You are the torch to the suites of love,
      Segment hitherto hidden rooms
      Suddenly shaped by the lyre of flames:
      Amorous lovers in the tapestries,
      A clock made like a flower with lips not hands,
      Aubusson carpets and Chinese beds.

      Lone is the ladder to the top of the tree
      which the climber pulls up after him
      To count anew the rungs & lie across:
      Among the apples nearest to the sun,
      The centre of a wheel of gleaming vistas.

      Indoors there is the discovering lamp,
      showing the lusters and the slanting chairs;
      In the open is the tree of triumph
      which we climb , eating the challenged fruit.

      Sylvia, my Muse, I adore you
                                         Dandy
