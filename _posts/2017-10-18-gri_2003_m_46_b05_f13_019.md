      Dearest Lawrence,
      Herewith the paper as
      I predicted- please will you
      fetch them on the 8th or 9th
      and please pad the frames
      carefully as they are rather
      nice and I should like to
      keep them in a good state
      I shall probably send them
      in to the Kensington- I
      shall try once more- the
      Womens International which
      I believe is in March- I
      hope that this time you will
      use any influence you have
      on my behalf.
      That you- Love me so much
      does not make me as happy
      as it used to- for in spite
      of loving me you do not
      seem to be able to do
      the one thing. That would

      Pett
      Dearest Lawrence,

      I predicted - Please will you
      fetch them on the 8th or 9th
      and please pad the frames
      carefully as  they are rather
      nice and I should like to
      keep them in a good state
      I shall probably send them
      in to the Kensington - I
      shall try once more - the
      Womens International which
      I believe is in March - I
      hope that this time you will
      use any influence you have
      on my behalf.
      That you love me so much
      does not make me as happy
      as it used to  - for in spite
      of loving me you do not
      seem to be able to do
      the one thing that would
