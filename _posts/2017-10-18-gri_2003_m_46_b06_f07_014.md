      Lessons

      1  THE MARTIAN

      What do do with it
      when you have it.

      Its mouth of mouths wet.
      It is not a pet.
      Perhaps I am its.
      Can it keep a song.
      Has it been watching long?

      I would detime it by means of flight.

      2 THINGS

      In cupboards no bigger
      on shelves no longer
      in gardens no darker
      than a six-foot man sees.
      Anything there? Why not?

      Safe with unaided eyes:
      no cracks to burrow
      no edges to hollow.
      But inside somebody
      goes where your blood goes.

      Supposing they don't do by clocks?

      3  SPACE SUITE

      It is no feudal set
      that clenches the body
      into a fist.  It is not
      the same as a diver's
      japanese french letter.

      With boots to walk out,
      with air to breathe in,
      with two-way phones:
      insect with outside bones.
      In it, like a man, get lost.

      The flag sags on Mars, it weighs light.

      LESSONS

      1     THE MARTIAN

      What do you do with it
      when you have it,
      do you eat or sleep with it,
      has it a life of its own,
      is it best alone?

      Its mouth or mouths wet.
      It is not a pet.
      Perhaps I am its.
      Can it keep a song,
      has it been watching long?

      I would define it by means of flight.

      LESSONS

      1 THE MARTIAN

      What do you do with it
      when you have it,
      do you eat or sleep with it,
      has it a life of its own,
      is it best alone?

      Its mouth or mouths wet.
      It is not a pet.
      Perhaps I am its.
      Can it keep a song,
      has it been watching long?

      I would define it by means of flight.

      2 THINGS

      In cupboards no bigger
      on shelves no longer
      in gardens no darker
      than a six-foot man sees.
      Anything there? Why not?

      Safe with unaided eyes:
      no cracks to burrow
      no edges to hollow.
      But inside somebody
      goes where your blood goes.

      Supposing they don't go by clocks?

      3 SPACE SUIT

      It is no feudal set
      that clenches the body
      into a fist. it is not
      the same as a diver's
      japanese french letter.

      With boots to walk out,
      with air to breathe in,
      with two-way phones:
      insect with outside bones.
      In it, like a man, get lost.

      The flag sags on Mars it weighs light.
