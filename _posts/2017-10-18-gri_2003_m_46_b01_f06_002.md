      This is just like 'old times' - writing you from my room again. I do not think that nostalgia is satisfied by this, however, as at present, I only feel your absence. It is fire weather today so i hope you can lie in the garden and relax and i do hope that life at the Rectory will be more calm now. It is only now that, looking back, I fully realise the tension of the second week. I love you; I wish it had been easier for you. On the other hand I wouldn't have missed a minute of it, being with you.
