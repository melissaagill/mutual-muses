      Dearest Sylvia,

      I am sorry that our talk this morning was intense but your letter was more discouraging perhaps than your realised.
      I implore you not to delay - it simply prolongs the conflict you are suffering, upsets me, and postpones our happiness.
      Do not revive the red-herring of security for you know I can give you that - and love as well for which security is a substitute.  But, of course, your feeling for Michael is the real difficulty; instead of enlarging the obstacle by staying where you are will you not leave him quickly.  Give our chance of happiness and mutual love the first place.  You say Michael may have changed: I doubt it but if he had would it cancel our love?  or your need for mine - as mine for yours.
      We have already compromised with the three-month period suggested.  Do not whittle away any more from our love.  I passionately and painfully sympathise with your conflict, believe me dearest, but the only way I can help is to be with you and not by waiting, waiting, waiting.

      I love you utterly, sylvia

      our talk this morning was intense but your letter was more discouraging than
      you perhaps realised. I implore you not to delay -- it simply prolongs the conflict
      you are suffering, upsets me, and postpones our happiness. Do not revive the
      red-herring of security for you know I can give you that -- and love as well
      for which security is a substitute. But, of course, your feeling for Michael
      is the real difficulty; instead of enlarging the obstacle by staying where you
      are will you not leave him quickly. Give our chance of happiness and mutual
      love the first place. You say Michael may have changed: I doubt it but if he
      had would it cancel our love? Or your need for mine -- as mine for yours. We
      have already compromised with the three-month period suggested. Do not whittle
      away any more from our love. I passionately and painfully sympathise with your
      conflict, believe me dearest, but the only way I can help is to be with you
      and not by waiting, waiting, waiting. <br/><br/>I love you utterly, Sylvia.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>'

      Dearest Sylvia,

          I am sorry that our talk this morning was intense but your letter was more discouraging than you perhaps realised.  I implore you not to delay- it simply prolongs the conflict you are suffering, upsets me, and postpones our happiness.  Do not revive the red-herring of security for you know I can give you that -  and love as well for which security is a substitute.  But, of course, your feeling for Michael is the real difficulty; instead of enlarging the obstacle by staying where you are will you not leave him quickly.  Give our chance of happiness and mutual love the first place.  You say Michael may have changed: I doubt it but if he had would it cancel our love?  Or your need for mine - as mine for yours. We have already compromised with the three-month period suggested.  Do not whittle away any more from our love.  I passionately and painfully sympathise with your conflict, believe me dearest, but the only way I can help is to be with you and not by waiting, waiting, waiting.

      I love you utterly,  Sylvia
