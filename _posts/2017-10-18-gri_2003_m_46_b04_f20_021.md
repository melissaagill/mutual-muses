      are applying.  He really isn't much
      use to you now for lectures are
      not the answer to your financial
      problem.
      Have you seen Gainsborough?
      Sent the poem to Sir Osbert, inquired
      about Placiy Arteles--like the
      "Phallasy of Height" of the Author.
      Sent D your film book to Hodders?
      How did your party go with
      Parsons?
      Please get my paintings as soon as
      possible for it is ridiculous waste
      of money.  I think we really should
      have had the sense to look at the
      form.  Anyway five shillings can
      be much more amusing in spent
      than at Bowlets.  Will you please
      get my broach please.
      Have you heard anythhing from Leeds?
      My Celtens will become unwelcome
      at this note--but I really feel
      extremely anxious.  You are nearly
      25--and have very little known
      about you.  When is your "present fame"
