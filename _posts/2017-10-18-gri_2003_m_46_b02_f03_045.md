      The Aubreys   Sunday
      Dearest Sylvia -
      The tie is a delight.  I was quite late to bed trying it on and admiring the resultant Dandylion in the mirror.  It fastens excellently and the colour is fine and strong.  When I consider that you wear the same material in your hat my pleasure is increased - so it is both delicious to look at and full of associations.  How resourceful of you to supply a clip also.
      I have read The Aspern Papers & several other stories by Henry James.  What an enchanting master of prose, situation, & character he is.  There have been sales at Smiths and I am quite laden down with valuable books cheaply procured.  How I shall transport them I don't know.
      The other evening, dying of boredom and unable to work, I went to a WEA Appreciation of Music class.  Scarlatti, Chopin, Dubussy
