      Dearest Sylvia
      Tell me which bus you are coming on and I will
      meet you at Lewisham on Monday. I am longing
      to see you, my darling.

      On Tuesday I have an afternoon lecture but
      the rest of the day I am not free either unfortun-
      ately as I am helping to hand the new exhibition
      at the ICA.

      Wednesday I have to go to Banstead and perhaps
      we can spend part of the day together, darling.

      One piece of news is that I suggested a Pasmore
      retrospective at the ICA committee meeting yester-
      day: the idea was approved at once, and I am to
      organise it. it will take place in March.

      I thought next week was busy but I seem to have
      6 lectures.

      Peter Banlam's wife is in hospital: having an opera-
      tion - I think it is fairly serious.

      See you on Monday. Tell me when.

      Love you
      Lawrence
