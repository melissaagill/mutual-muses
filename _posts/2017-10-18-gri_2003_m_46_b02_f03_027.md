      The AUBREYS
      23rd March 1949

      Dearest Sylvia

      In your letter you record Michael's allowance of 3 or 4 days a week without saying what your own attitude is but I am sure you feel as I do that it is not a helpful contribution to his agonizing dilemma.  I remember you said that if he did not accept Flugel's suggestion, and if he were to leave you (not you leave him) the situation would be bearable.  Does this no longer apply?  Do you not believe my love would heal the would if he left you?  If he makes the decision - and does not seem to be resolved on having you completely or not at all - will you not permit it?  Please try not to compromise, dearest one.  The 3 or 4 days is not a reality - concession I think.  Dearest Sylvia, I love you.  All my poems plead for me now.  I love you, my beautiful creature, I love you.

      leave you (not you leave him) the situation would be bearable. Does this no
