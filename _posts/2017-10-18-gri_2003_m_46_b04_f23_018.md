      Dearest Lawrence,
           What a splendid poem in [unclear]between[/unclear] [unclear]for[/unclear][unclear]mime[/unclear] - how I enjoy Science thus transmuted.
           How busy you are! I'm so glad that you have found a [unclear]missing[/unclear] film and very much look forward to reading the chapter - and I do wish I could hear your lectures. I understand by your letter that the [unclear]Munch[/unclear] is an "extra - Tuesday" [unclear]done[/unclear] - I am so glad - I think thats very flattering.  What a pity they do not feel obliged to show their appreciationwith slightly increased emoluments! However, it does make a little more but hardly[unclear]compensates [/unclear] with your time even - but enormously good for prestige which will soon lead to something important I feel [unclear]sure.[/unclear]  Also you are advertised by name at the [unclear] T.G.[/unclear]   Charles is too wonderful - Madge hasn't groomed

      Dearest Lawrence,
      What a splendid poem in return for mine - how to enjoy science thus transmuted.
      How busy you are!  I'm so glad that you have found a missing film and very much look forward to reading the chapters- and I do wish I could hear your lectures. I understand by your letter that the [unclear]munch[/unclear] is an extra - Tuesday one - I am so glad- I think that very flattering.  What a pity they do not feel obligated to show their appreciation with slightly increased emoluments!  However it does make a little more but hardly commensurate with your time even - but enormously good for prestige which will soon lead to something important I feel sure.  Also you are advertised by name at the T.G.  Charles it too wonderful - Madge hasn't groomed
