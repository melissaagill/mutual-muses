      VII
      By the way - I had a resistance to catching my train.  Having been told it was at platform one I went to Platform Four to catch it.  Here I am on it but I clearly wanted to stay in Hastings.
      Would Lionel walk something like this - do you think?  You must advise me.  That is not quite right.
      Dearest one, look after yourself.  I do love you.  Be tranquil in your belief in my love.
      I love you
      Lawrence
