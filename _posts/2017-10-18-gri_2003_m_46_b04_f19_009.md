      my picture<br/>in the garden yesterday afternoon<br/>and it was hot, but very
      windy-<br/>it did not disturb me but it<br/>was unattractive - today it is<br/>windy
      and grey. I managed to<br/>do some more - the background<br/>on Desiree's side,
      the sky, map<br/>out the plants against the wall,<br/>and the trees on the left,
      and<br/>I am very pleased with it. I<br/>think it should be a very good<br/>one.
      I think I read in the <br/>Times something about the pictures<br/>you mention
      - lent by the Lichten<br/>-stien of some Prince - I long<br/>to see them.<br/>Thank
      you for sending Athene<br/>your letter and the most delightful<br/>poem - I
      adore it - but think<br/>the rhymes most negligent!
