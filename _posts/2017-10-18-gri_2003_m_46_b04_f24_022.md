      which is very sweet of him. I had hoped to send it to the S.E.A. but I shall send "Brassica Seedlings" instead, and "Tiny Reading in the Garden" as I found a frame to fit it and think it rather jolly. I fear I take all this trouble for nothing but hope I shall be lucky this time - perhaps Miss Coop will help!

      I hope your Christmas went off well and that you will have a good audience on the 1st.

      Thank you again for taking - my work - I hope you can - I imagine you would wire if you could not.

      I've no news otherwise but that I love you dearly and long to see you.

      I love you
      Sylvia

      P.S. I seem to have left the pictures behind. Will send them next letter - had such a rush to catch the 10.5 with the pictures!
