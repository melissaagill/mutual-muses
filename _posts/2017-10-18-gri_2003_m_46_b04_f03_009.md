      Dearest Sylvia,
           Do not bother about the [unclear]Tate[/unclear] - the [unclear]lime[/unclear] service commission are going to send me the papers:   I called there yesterday for them & they are not [unclear]out[/unclear] yet.
           Your suggestion about Evergreen is wonderful:  I shall insert your paraphrase at the appropriate point of [unclear]Shadow on Sunset Boulevard.[/unclear]. Thank you so much, my collaborator, my muse.
           Of course you shall have [unclear] V. Dent.
       [/unclear]  Here it is. I am sorry not to have sent it to you before. I am sorry that it is on completely transparent paper:  put a sheet of what paper behind each page as you read.
           I am glad you wrote as you did - for lions are sometimes a little bit [unclear]plantarlie[/unclear]. I don't think of you as forcing my hand: on the contrary, I value your helpful words. I was not really working out the implications of my decisions.
           I am sorry to hear about [unclear]Tiny's [/unclear] sister - & even sorrier to hear that Mary Jane will soon be guest. Don't let Tiny adopt her too.

      Dearest Sylvia
      Do not bother about the Tate--the [unclear][/unclear]
      service commission are going to send me the
      papers:  I called there yesterday for them and
      they are not out yet.
      Your suggestion about Evergreen is wonder-
      ful:  I shall insert your paraphrase at the
      appropriate point of Shadow on Sunset [unclear][/unclear]
      [unclear][/unclear]  Thank you so much, my collaborator,
      my muse.
      Of course you shall have V. Dent.  Here
      it is.  I am sorry not to have sent it to you
      before.  I am sorry that it is on completely
      transparent paper:  put a sheet of white paper
      behind each page as you read.
      I am glad you wrote as you did--for lions
      are sometimes a little bit [unclear]fantastic[/unclear].  I don't
      think of you as forcing my hand:  on the contrary
      I value your helpful words.  I was not really
      working out the implications of my decisions.
      I am sorry to hear about Tiny's sister--and even
      sorrier to hear that Mary Jane will soon [unclear]be a guest[/unclear].
      Don't let Tiny adopt her too.
