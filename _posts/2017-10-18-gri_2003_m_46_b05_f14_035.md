      5    on the cover of Art News, and could
      not discover at first just why it didn't
      come off.  I was exasperated, and
      even thought I might be wrong!  It
      might be good after all, but I have
      found it out, of course its out of drawing.
      There is too much top to the head, for
      although the head is inclined it is not
      inclined that much, but the features
      I think aren't quite coordinated either!
      I pencilled in a line where the head
      should come--it looks much better!
      Well I must to work now, tell
      me your plans, Do send some poems
      to Sir O.!  I have thought of
      a landscape with the fig tree.  I will
      sketch it when it is more complete.
      I have stretched and primed (1st coat)
      a canvas for the small still life.
      O, I do think of you, my dearest.
      You are my lode-star, my thoughts
      turn to you as does a sunflower to
      her Apollo.
      I love you

      5 on the cover of Art-News, and could
      not discover at first just why it didn't
      come off - I was exasperated - and
      even though I might be wrong! It
      might be good after all - but I have
      found it out - of course it's out of drawing.
      There is too much top to the head - for
      although the head is included it is not
      inclined that much - but the features
      I think again quite coordinated either!
      I penciled in a line where the head
      should come - it looks much better!
      Well I must to work now - tell
      me your plans - do send some poems
      to Sir O.! I have thought of
      a landscape with the fig-tree I will
      sketch it when it is more complete.
      I have stretched and primed (1st coat)
      a canvas for the small Still-life.
      O, I do think of you, my dearest.
      You are my lode-star - my thoughts
      turn to you as does a sunflower to
      her Apollo.
      I love you
      Sylvia.
