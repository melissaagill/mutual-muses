      11 Mansel Road
      Wimbledon
      26 XII 1949
      Dearest Sylvia
      When I came here on Saturday the first thing I had
      to do was put up the decorations -

      Soon after that was done I had to devise
      with Deirdre's help a treasure hunt con-
      sisting of rebus, riddle, poem, mirror writing,
      and mad little inventions probably still un-named.

      I have won a small prize, a tiny nylon nail
      brush which I won for my performance in a general know-
      ledge game. The fact that this prize came to me for such
      a game will give you, better than any words of
      mine, a glimpse of my companions, of the kind of
      people I am thrust among.

      This evening I am going to [unclear]Wally's[/unclear] small
      party which may be more congenial though it must
      be said that the food and the drink here is superior

      hunt consisting of relus , riddle, poem, mirror writing, and mod little inventions
      probably still un - named.<br/>I have won a small prize, a tiny nylon nail brush
      which I won for my performance in a general knowledge game. The fact that this
      prize came to me for such a game will give you, better than any words of mine,
      a glimpse of my companions, of the kind of people I am thrust among.<br/>This
      evening I am going to Molly's small party which may be more congenial though
      it must be said that the food and drinks here is superior <br/><br/>
