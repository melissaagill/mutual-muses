      Wimbledon

      15 ix 1948

      Dearest Sylvia,

      'Make not my glad cause, cause of mourning'.
      George Peele.

      Your letter moved me very much. My first thought after receiving it was to phone or wire you. The post seemed too slow. But I realised it is the only mode of communication full enough and private. This morning you will have my letter.

      I know well that your past has been bitter and I do hope that its memories have not been roused by my words on Monday. If so I ask you to forgive me and remember, not that clumsiness, but the moments I have pleased you.

      I remember that we worked out an intellectual basis for our love. I think it still holds. The fact that I desire more than I get is not incompatible with reality -- for reality in this case could be a little more generous than things-as-they-are.

      The words of yours that wring my heart are 'worn out'. I know what they mean -- indifference born of pain, and I only hope your suffering has not had this effect this time for I hope you are persuaded again of the sincerity of energy of my love.

      Have you felt like painting yet? Your portrait of Michael is a step in the direction you have wanted to go -- towards more descriptive drawing though I am delighted your color has not been in the last sacrificed.

      For Sylvia

      Mirrors compete
      For my lady's form.
      Are sad to lose
      Her lovely arms,
      Browned by the sun.
      When she turns to me;

      For then my eyes
      Reflect her beauty
      More surely than the glass,
      For to her images
      I add desire
      And confidence of grace.

      I love you, Lawrence

      Sylvia,<br/><br/>'Make not my glad cause, cause of mourning'. George Peele.<br/><br/>Your
      letter moved me very much. My first thought after receiving it was to phone
      or wire you. The post seemed to slow. But I realised it is the only communication
      full enough and private. This morning you will have read my letter.<br/><br/>I
      know well that your past has been bitter and I do hope that its memories have
      not been roused by my words on Monday. If so I ask you to forgive me and remember,
      not that clumsiness, but the moments I have pleased you.<br/><br/>I remember
      that we worked out an intellectual basis for our love. I think it still holds.
      The fact that I desire more than I get is not incompatible with reality - for
      reality in this case could be a little more generous than things-as-they-are.<br/><br/>The
      words of yours that wring my heart are 'worn out'. I know what they mean - indifference
      born of pain, and I only hope your suffering has not had this effect this time
      for I hope you are persuaded again of the sincerity and energy of my love.<br/><br/>Have
      you felt like painting yet? Your portrait of Michael is a step in the direction
      you have wanted to go - towards more descriptive drawing though I am delighted
      you color has not been in the least sacrificed.<br/><br/>For Sylvia<br/>Mirrors
