      28th August, 1952

      Dearest Sylvia,

      Thank you for your letter: I am happy your
      journey was comfortable, and that both your
      hosts at Bath are so pleasant. Enjoy yourself
      my darling cat: remember to sip the repellent
      but nourishing waters every morning in the
      Pump Room (where you can also read PUNCH).

      (J gave my name to an Art. Soc. in Rams-
      gate who have asked me to visit there in
      early October. £4, expenses, and it will
      be nice to go there again (it's not far from
      Margate).

      A dream of Dandy's
      last night. I am
      sure you will
      recognise the
      'residual
      material of the day'.

      The death of my uncle has benefitted me further.
      Beyone the Class A subscription. A pair of leather
      slippers (about which I am dubious) & three nice
      shirts (2 blue, one oatmeal), & Hankies. And,
      from Father a lavish, wonderful American tie
      (the gift of my parents' recent guest).
