      if you see him on Monday he will no
      doubt tell you about it--he is
      most enthusiastic, as were the audiences.
      Some of them even came again.
      There were a lot of photographs taken
      and I shall buy some and try to
      construct a picture, it was impossible to do any sketching on the spot as I
      had hoped.
      If you are to get this on Monday I
      must go and post it.  I'm afraid this
      is rather a cross letter.  I feel
      cross and extremely disgruntled--I
      suppose it's the date and our coolness
      to each other.  I don't really feel
      I can honestly send you a loving mess-
      age, although I love you--and I
      wonder why I bother to write long
      handed letters to you for you don't
      answer the and you tell me the
      very minimum about yourself.
