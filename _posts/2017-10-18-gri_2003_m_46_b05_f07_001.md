      13TH July Blackheath [1952?]

      Dearest Sylvia
      Here is the Brighton poem I meant to give
      you when you were here:

      Open like shells upon the sand
      The crescents face the sea:
      Here one can walk, aware of space
      And history.

      The history is look for
      In street & square & park
      Is of my love, and every house
      Supports a plague.

      Perhaps you walked through Adelaide
      On Regency Square
      About this time or, on the front, laid
      In a deck-chair

      The sails upon the sea are like
      Scissors cutting through a dress.
      How often did you count the spires
      Of The Chinese house?

      Here love provides a Baedeker
      To your town my Dear.

      On Regency Square
      About this line or, on the front, laid
      In a deck-chair

      The sails upon the sea are like
      Scissors cutting through a dress.
      How often did you count the spires
      Of the [unclear]Chinese[/unclear] house?

      Here [unclear]lone[/unclear] provides a [unclear]Baldelies[/unclear]
      To your town, my Dear.

      is the Brighton poem I meant to give<br/>you when you were here:<br/>Open like
      shells upon the sand<br/>The crescents face the sea:<br/>Here one can walk,
      aware of space<br/>And history.<br/><br/>The history I look for<br/>In street  square
      spark<br/>Is of my love, and every house<br/>supports a plaque<br/><br/>Perhaps
      you walked through Adelaide<br/>On Regency Square<br/>About this line or, on
      the front, laid<br/>In a deck-chair<br/><br/>The sails upon the sea are like<br/>Scissors
      cutting through a dress.<br/>How often did you count the spires<br/>Of the Chinese
      house?<br/><br/>Here lone provides a Baldelies<br/>To your town, my Dear.
