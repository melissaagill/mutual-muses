      3-3-52 Pett Dearest Lawrence,
      Indeed I will come on Thursday
      6th by the morning 'bus. I think
      you have forgotten (repressed ?) the
      fact that I am spending the week-
      end at Cambridge - it will be a
      short one of course. If Michael is
      working, I shall go up early Saturday
      after-noon. I'm not sure whether
      he expects me to stay on Sunday night
      or no. I will enquire to-day.
      When do you expect me to return?
      on Tuesday or later? for I want
      to let the Greenwoods know. Are you
      giving a morning lecture at Southend -
      or are you staying the night?

      I am most excited to hear of
      you two finish chapters and long to
      hear them.

      come on Thursday 6th. by the morning bus. I think you have forgotten (repressed?)
      the fact that I am spending the weekend at Cambridge- it will be a short one
      of course. If Michael is working I shall go up early Saturday after-noon. I'm
      not sure whether he expects me to stay on Sunday night or no. I will enquire
      to-day. When do you expect me to return? on Tuesday or later? For I want to..
      let the Greenwoods know. Are you giving a morning lecture at Southend or are
      you staying the night?<br/>       I am most excited to hear of your two first
      chapters and long to hear them.
