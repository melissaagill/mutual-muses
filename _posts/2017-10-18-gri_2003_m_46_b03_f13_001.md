      Kensington Gardens  Saturday June 3rd
      Dearest Lawrence
      Petrol being off the Ration Michael brought his pictures to the Observer Exhibition, and I collected my pictures from the Kensington Gallery. When Clifford and Marjorie were on holiday they bought one - was-n't it nice of them? They thoroughly enjoyed their holiday and had a very happy time at "the Ship" and "did" Brighton and Shore thoroughly. They enjoyed "The Ring around the Moon" enormously. and thought it excellent.
      The holiday did Clifford so much good that he has worked wonders with the garden, painted the radiators and done inumerable odd jobs.
      Sunday
      Clifford has 2 3 year courses and 1 of 1 year - he has been offered another terminal which he has refused, and, most exciting, has been invited to go to Oxford to see the university authorities about tutorials!
