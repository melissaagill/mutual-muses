      would let them know if you can't

      and nice. I haven't had the
      proof of the card yet.
      Thank you for sending my
      notes - I'm sorry to bother you
      with the other things. I wonder
      too if you would mind sending
      me the pattern No of the

    clean_transcription: Rectory Lodge 1.12.52<br/><br/>Dearest Lawrence,<br/>I enclose
      the order for reward<br/>from Kensington - perhaps you<br/>would let them know
      if you can't<br/>collect by the 15th so that<br/>they will not "warehouse" the<br/>2.
      I wrote to Chase a nice<br/>but firm letter about the 5th<br/>of March - Tiny
      thought it good<br/>and nice. I haven't had the<br/>proof of the card yet.<br/>Thank
      you for sending my<br/>notes - I'm sorry to bother you<br/>with the other things.
      I wonder<br/>too if you would mind sending<br/>me the pattern No of the<br/>Jarkin-Cardigan
      you admired<br/>in my Voyage book - it's too<br/>new to be in Plummer books<br/>here!<br/>You
      will be so pleased to<br/>hear that Clifford has match<br/>-ed the glass that
      Tiny broke
