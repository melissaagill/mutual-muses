      The book you mention on the English court would be a delight though I do see a vast amount of work as being necessary and a most expensive number of trips to private collections - [Chatsworth] is only one that comes to mind.  Also, I like very well the suggested political conclusions and I wonder, here, how far we would agree - just how far you would agree to come with me toward total monarchy's attitude toward the masses.  And even an implicit condemnation of our present stolid, boring Royal Family for being 'above suspicion'.  What [dawning] vistas of ideas are opened by your suggestion.  We should have to try and get one of the 45 suites at Hampton Court to write it in, I think.

      Yesterday I went to London for the first time for weeks and saw Fuseli again, Sutherland's new work, and David Jones' new collection of which I enclose one illustration, all I could get.

      The reason by the way for this [enforced] absence from town is one I must now tell you.  I had not committed it to paper before because I did not want you to
