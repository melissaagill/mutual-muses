      A lady asks me
      I speak in season
      She seeks reason for an affect, wild often
      That is so proud he hath Love for a name

      I hope to be able to finish the poem, bits of which I read you,
      soon and get on to something more attractive.  I have intuitions
      about what is needed to complete it.

      What does Clifford think about Cocteau Englished?  Would he
      be willing to check the meanings, senses?  How are the Woods?
      I hpe that C is no longer tired or suffering with his cold and
      that Tiny is cheerful (for her) and not in the process of what
      we doctors call littlehamtonisation.  My 'Fessor must not put
      up with any nonsense that might interrupt her painting.

      Incidentally returning to Cocteau:  in the IJPA there are some
      comments on death (ugliness) versus aesthetics which suggest a
      connection, even if in reverse, with Cocteau.  Joan Rivere is
      the writer.  I have not sorted the idea out yet but it may be
      fruitful.

      Water is dripping from the eaves and the snow looks soft so
      perhaps there is a gradual thaw.  I hope so:  I feared yester-
      day evening that it was going to freeze, so cold was it.

      I hope you slept well Friday and Saturday nights.  I love
      you so much, dearest Sylvia, I love you.

      The Hundreds of Lions' boat race yesterday was run despite in-
      clement weather.  The result was a dead-heat so everybody got
      first prizes and had a huge warm party afterwards.

      A lady asks me
      I speak in season
      She seeks reason for an affect, wild often
      That is so proud he bath Love for a name

      I hope to be able to finish the poem, bits of which I read you, soon and get on to something more attractive. I have intuitions about what is needed to complete it.

      What does Clifford think about Cocteau Englished? Would he be willing to check the meanings, senses? How are the Woods? I hope that C. is no loner tired or suffering with his cold and that Tiny is cheerful (for her) and not in the process of what we doctors call littlehamptonisation. My 'Fessor must not put up with any nonsense that might interrupt her painting.

      Incidentally returning to Cocteau:  in the IJPA there are some comments on death (ugliness) versus aesthetics which suggest a connection, even if in reverse, with Cocteau. Joan Riviere is the writer. I have not sorted the idea out yet but it may be fruitful.

      Water is dripping from the eaves and the snow looks soft so perhaps there is a gradual thaw. I hope so: I feared yesterday evening that it was going to freeze, so cold was it.

      I hope you slept well Friday and Saturday nights. I love you so much, dearest Sylvia, I love you,
      Lawrence

      The Hundreds of Lions' boat race yesterday was run despite inclement weather. The result was a dead-heat so everybody got first prizes and had a huge warm party afterwards.
