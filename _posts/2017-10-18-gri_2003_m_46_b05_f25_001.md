      3    John's back is better and he
      sent his love!  Audrey sent a
      very nice letter and some plants
      which I thought very sweet of
      her as they are a nuisance to
      send off--Bovage, St. John's
      Wort and strawberry plants.
      There are still a lot of leaves
      and it looks very charming here
      after church (sermon on St. Luke!)
      I went into the paddock and
      picked up chestnuts with the
      moral support of a very handsome
      robin.  Although it was pouring
      with rain I was quite sheltered
      by the trees.
      I gather Cuthner's Lecture
      wasn't very good, the society
      is not continuing, neither will
      the journal unless a rich Amer-
      ican can sponsor it.
      Clifford and Tiny inquired
      tenderly after you and rejoiced
      in your triumphs which I
      recounted to them.
