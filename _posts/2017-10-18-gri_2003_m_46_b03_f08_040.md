      Dearest Sylvia
            I am delighted by your sketch of your new painting and, in the letter that came today, of news of your progress. Yes, bring as many paintings as you feel like, so we can go to any galleries you feel up to visiting. I should write to [unclear] Miller [/unclear] if I were you - it is always a good thing to announce one's visit. I am not sure what the S.E.A. is you refer to (the only one I know is the Society for Education in Art) is but certainly do submit some paintings when the time comes.
            This morning I spent hours at the S E A, working out possible contributions to the next members, going through the list of members, and so on. I am really very interested in [unclear] ill[/unclear] concern. Mrs [unclear] Bales [/unclear] (Miss [unclear] Chicky [/unclear]) is on holiday but Joan Barlett is helpful and seems very nice. I have started acquiring review copies: I have Keyes "Blake's Engravings" with me, already, you will be glad to hear.

      This morning I spent hours at the S E A, work-
      ing and possible contributions to the next member,
      going through the list of members, and so on. I am
