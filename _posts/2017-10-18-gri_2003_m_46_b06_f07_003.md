      work on - on his holiday.
      I am relieved that you and Tiny are
      getting on well now. At least -
      that you were on the 29th. She can
      be so nice, when she is able.

      Well lion is getting hungry. I have
      (from Mother) a home-made [unclear][/unclear]
      [unclear][/unclear] for lunch: then cheese and
      bananas. Then I shall do some
      more to the Travel Agent.

      (I'm thinking of applying for a job
      as a cinema - manager. I can [unclear][/unclear]
      C's imagination getting to
      work on that!) See enclosed drawing.

      I love and adore you
      I love you
