      Women dream of beards & blazers:
      So Phyllis is supposed to sleep
      Soundly reversing facts of day,
          In night's dominion.

      But sometimes I dream of Hetty
      And you imagine Hetty, in such dreams
      As whispers of identity in common
          Despite the changing facts.

         Have you managed to paint at all - perhaps making a beginning on another flowers & still-life picture & despite the claims of your time over Christmas.
         If you will lend me the 23 for a short time could I have it by Monday for Mrs. Harrison is patient but I do not want to break the camel's back.

          I love you     I love  you
