      I might go to Molly's on one day over the holiday, I don't know yet. I may not. I do hope that you have a pleasant time with Michael at Pett.
      I have one or two ideas for poems and ideas on how to revise slightly some already written, but, alas, I must put lecture and articles first. Still I expect I shall make time if the muse is willing.
      Have a good Easter; look after yourself.
      I love you,
      Lawrence
