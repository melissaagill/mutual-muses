      Blackheath
      Sunday
      Dearest Sylvia
      Yesterday was not a day of rest for your lion after all. He went to the I.C.A. in the evening because Madeleine was [unclear]basters[/unclear] for the 'social evening'. I am  glad I went (apart from the dancing) because of the calypso singer Lord Beginnes was there. He really is amazingly good. He is the most famous of the W. Indian singers of calypsos. As you know, these are improvised and as Madeleine & I were in a conspicuous place we were introduced into a calypso about the choice of wines - he painted a picture of my introducing her to my family. (Hetty said she would love to see that! Would not Mother be surprised!)
      Do you know I have not yet been paid for my lectures at the T.G. - let alone the Arts Council ones!
      (I shall soon have to send the moths in my purse out to look for friends who live in richer purses. They should be confidence - Moths- winning from the other moths by the 3-wing trick as Spot The Butterfly.)
      When I told Paul about your sale he complimented the buyer on his taste and perception. P is working on a very large picture ( a 5 x 4 feet - or somewhere about that). It is an oil. We discussed it. He is not satisfied with his technique: he is influenced by Tanguy. I then criticised Tanguy because he implicitly adopts conventional perspective & hence is reactionary. ( This is not a view I subscribe to particularly - but as you know that does not exercise me.) I left P., I'm afraid if his oil were not a mistake and that his free style in gouache were not more valid He thought he might not finish the oil. I then tried to upset my argument but without much success. The dangers of art-criticism! I hope he does finish it: provisional title ' Penelope in the Poet's Web'.
      FROM A NEW POEM
      The luminous ferns stray up the tree
      of night whose fruit hang in the country
      And in the mutinous waters: I wait
      Among the roots that hold the bale.
      Do fruit split if you wait till they fall.
      Why wait until they are shapely but rotten inside.
      I cannot reach the country from their roots.
      Stars are apples for the distant ciders.

      Dearest Sylvia. I love you, you do love me don't you. I love you so dearly,
      Lawrence

      Dearest Sylvia

      Yesterday was not a day of rest for your lion after all. He went to the I.C.A. in the evening because Madeleine was [unclear][/unclear] for the 'social evening'. I am glad I went (apart from the dancing) because the Calypso singer Lord Beginner was there. He really is amazingly good. He is the most famous of the W. Indian singers of Calypsos. As you know, these men improvise and as Madeleine and I were in a conspicuous place we were introduced into a calypso about the choice of wives- he painted a picture of my introducing her to my family. (Hetty said she would love to see that! Would not Mother be surprised!) Do you know I have not yet been paid for my lectures at the T.G.- let alone the Arts Council ones!

      (I shall soon have to send the moths in my purse out to look for friends who live in richer purses, They shall be Confidence-Moths- winning from the other moths by the 3-wing trick [unclear][/unclear] as "Spot The Butterfly".)

      When I told Paul about your sale he complimented the buyer on his taste and perception. P is working on a very large picture (ca 5 & 4  [unclear]feat[/unclear]- or somewhere about that). It is an oil. We discussed it. he is not satisfied with his technique: he is influenced by [unclear]Targuy[/unclear] I then criticised Targuy because he is implicitly adapts conventional perspective and hence is reactionary. (This is not a view I subscribe to particularly- but as you know that does exercise me.) I left P., I'm afraid, wondering if his oil were not a mistake and that his free style in [unclear]gauche[/unclear] were not more[unclear]rabid[/unclear]. He thought he might not finish the oil. I then tried to upset my argument but without much success. The dangers of art-criticism! I hope he does finish it: [unclear][/unclear] "Penelope in the Poet's Web'.

      Do fruit split if you wait till they fall.
