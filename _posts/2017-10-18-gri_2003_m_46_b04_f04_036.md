      27 iv 1951  Blackheath
      Dearest Sylvia
      Thank you for your two letters.  First let me say that
      I shall be delighted to meet you on Sunday and do
      the inventory with you.  Then, I take it, you will
      come back to Blackheath with me for the night?
      I will meet whatever train you tell me.  I am
      so glad to see you again, then, alone.
      Your letters are full of charming rural informaton
      and images which is very pleasing to me.  I am, of
      course, overjoyed to hear that you are at work
      on a new oil, of a 'little bridge', 'with old
      brick work'.  Paul was very pleased with his
      'Kissing', very pleased indeed:  he much admired
      your new flowers on the window-ledge painting
      and the unfinished double-portrait.
      Fancy your being [unclear]puce[/unclear]!  That's like me getting
      [unclear][/unclear].  (How do you spell it?  Still, you know what
      I mean.)
      Good news about the Kerrington Art Gallery.
      I look forward to seeing your watercolour
      up there.

      Blackheath 27 10 1951
      Dearest Sylvia
      Thank you for your two letters. First let me say that I shall be delighted to meet you on Sunday and do the inventory with you. Then, I take it, you will come back to Blackheath with me for the night? I will meet whatever train you tell me. I am so glad to see you again, then, alone.

      Your letters are full of charming rural information and images which is very pleasing to me. I am, of course, overjoyed to hear that you are at work on a new oil, of a 'little bridge', 'with old brick work'. Paul was very pleased with his [unclear]'Kissing'[/unclear], very pleased indeed: he much admired your new flowers on the window-ledges painting and the unfinished double-portrait.

      Fancy your being [unclear]nice[/unclear]! That's like my getting [unclear]catoor[/unclear]. (How do you spell it? Still, you know what I mean.)

      Good news about the Kensington Art Gallery. I look forward to seeing your watercolors up there.
