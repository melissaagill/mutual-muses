      am afraid my wish to see you was responsible for blurring my sense of time.  I am sorry, my dearest.
        I have seen Lady From Shanghi again, and I now think you are too hard on Rosalie.  There is no doubt in my mind that she loved O'Hara but she was not able to integrate him with her plan of murdering Bannister.  Remember, at the end, she says she loves O'Hara--desperately persuasive. When he came out of [unclear] her [/unclear] and [unclear] Grishy's[/unclear] plot she tried to love him again.
        Tomorrow I am meeting [unclear] Salmon [/unclear] and many others.  The Tate or the Sculpture exhibition is where we shall go.  Some time this week Francis Klingender is going to show me his collection of [unclear] ogarth [/unclear] material.
        It has just struck eleven.  P.M., not A.M. or perhaps it is safer to say, night not morning as I never was sure of that abbreviation.  Anyway I think of you as lovingly and wistfully as at our morning hour. I shall say goodnight now and pick up the letter again tomorrow morning.  Goodnight, Sylvia.  As you have said to me so often, 'sleep well.'
