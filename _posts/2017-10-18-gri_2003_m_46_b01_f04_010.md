      IV

      Here is a poem I wrote some nights
      ago do you remember, when you slept
      at the Philips.

      Tonight
      and there is a [unclear][/unclear]
      That opens
      curtains and pulls
      At the lanterns and the stars
      Your sleep
      Compels insomnia
      In my glow-worm restlessness

      You sleep in a Regency bed
      Measuring five foot ten
      Against your five foot three
      You are [unclear][/unclear] where
      Tonight
      I am [unclear][/unclear] even
      [unclear][/unclear] Regent

      I am by no means sure that I shall go
      to Italy with John & [unclear]Gilbert[/unclear] because John
      is talking in terms of 'ruck sacks',
      'ground sheets' and what have you.
      Camping - but without, even, a tent.
      However John is willing to let
      me share his money for the trip. I don't

    clean_transcription: IV<br/><br/>Here is a poem I wrote some nights<br/>ago do
      you remember, when you slept<br/>at the Philips.<br/><br/>Tonight<br/>and there
      is a <br/>That opens<br/>curtains and pulls<br/>At the lanterns and the stars<br/>Your
      sleep<br/>Compels insomnia<br/>In my glow-worm restlessness<br/><br/>You sleep
      in a Regency bed<br/>Measuring five foot ten<br/>Against your five foot three<br/>You
      are  where<br/>Tonight<br/>I am  even<br/> Regent<br/><br/>I am by no means
      sure that I shall go<br/>to Italy with John & Gilbert because John<br/>is talking
      in terms of 'ruck sacks',<br/>'ground sheets' and what have you.<br/>Camping
      - but without, even, a tent.<br/>However John is willing to let<br/>me share
      his money for the trip. I don't<br/>know what to decide.<br/>
