      Pett 20.2.52
      Dearest Lawrence, Dear Love,
      How very pleasing to hear from you so soon, and how nice to hear of your successful lecture. I do hope that I may visit the R.A. with you before this exhibition closes. I wonder if you looked at the architectural section at the miniatures this time.
      I enclose 2 advertisements from to-day's "Fives" - they may interest you.
      I feel happy and reassured of your love again - so that I too feel you "near" me in thought and feeling, dearest Lawrence my poet.
      I hope that your lecture goes well at Baustead to-night. Tiny has gone off to Littlehampton until Saturday. Which she will enjoy. She seems more cheerful again.

    clean_transcription: 20-2-52 Pett Dearest Lawrence, Dear Love,<br/>How very pleasing
      to hear from<br/>you so soon, and how nice to hear of<br/>your successful lecture.
      I do hope that<br/>I may visit the R.A. with you before<br/>this exhibition
      closes. I wonder if <br/>you looked at the architectual section<br/>or the minutures
      this time.<br/>I enclose 2 advertisements from<br/>to-day's "Times" - they may
      interest<br/>you.<br/>I feel happy and reassured of your<br/>love again - so
      that I too feel you<br/>"near" me in thought and feeling,<br/>dearest Lawrence
      my poet.<br/>I hope that your lecture goes well<br/>at Banstead to-night. Tiny
      has gone<br/>off to Littlehampton until Saturday,<br/>which she will enjoy.
      She seems more<br/>cheerful again.<br/>
