      17 July
      My dearest Sylvia
      What a holiday.  I loved every minute of
      it.  Being with you, and being away
      with you.  You made me so happy.  Even
      though we are parted again and I am
      back here, I still feel how close we
      are, how much you love me.  I hope
      you feel my love as strongly.  you
      are so kind and sweet:  thank you
      again for my--no, our--holiday.
      I love you.
      I rang up Magda and she hoped that
      you were still here and could come
      to the BBC this evening.  She was not
      disappointed you were no longer in
      town.
      Thank you for your letter.  I am glad
      your journey was painless.  Even
      catching the bus:  good for you.
      I am glad M is not too bad.  That will
