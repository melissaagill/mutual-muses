      record [unclear]sootled[/unclear] me somewhat.

      Your paintings seem to be earning very well. I expect they are finished now. Te me all about them. I am happy that you are working well.

      You have seen nearly everything I've written. A spell of boredom & indifference has paralyzed my hand - as a result of which I have not yet finished the seicento review even.

      I read the wartimes, completely without profit or interest.

      Perhaps you are right about the Bacchus poem and I will find the original ending and send it to you. Your praise of it cheers me considerably.

      Lines reams to have made his mind about a summer lecture before I have!

      This letter suffers from lack of concentration.  I can't help it. I'll send a fuller letter later today if I can. Really I just want to say, again, how much I love you.

      Lawrence

      II
      records soothed me somewhat.

      Your paintings seem to be coming very well. I expect they are finished now.  Tell me all about them.  I am happy that you are working well.

      You have seen nearly everything I've written. a spell of boredom & indifference has paralyzed my hand-as a result of which I have not yet finished the [unclear]elicento[/unclear] review even.

      I read the mortimer, completely without[unclear]mofit[/unclear] or interest.

      Perhaps you are right about the Bacchus poem and I will find the original ending and send it to you. Your praise of it cheers me considerably.

      Lines seems to have made up his mind about a summer lecture before I have!

      This letter suffers from a lack of concentration. I can't help it. Ill send a full letter later today if I can. Really I just wanted to say, again, how much I love you. Lawrence
