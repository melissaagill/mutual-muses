      Here is a Dandylion on his way to the N G against the wind.
      Thank you very much for your let-ter, darling.  The work you do to your painting is very inspiring to me and makes me want to write a long poem rather than many short lyrics.  Have you got another mirror from Tiny as you hoped?
