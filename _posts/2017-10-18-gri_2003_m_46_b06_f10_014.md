      My dearest Sylvia
      Your letter cheered me up very much with its news that
      you had seen Diana, were going to see Beryl & that the Woods
      are behaving agreeably. And I am very relieved that
      your 'cold' feelings have cleared up. Good. Yes, I should
      certainly go to the Rye artists if I were you: apart from
      personal reason, we do agree in supporting local
      organisations. Speaking of local organisations the Mans-
      bridge's party consisted of about 17 people, including Beth Swan-
      wich & Ian something-something who we met with Mansbridge once.
      Rill was there, too: he asked of you warmly. It was very
      pleasant. I met someone who can arrange for us to see Van-
      brugh Castle which is something we have always wanted.

      Forgive my writing but I am doing this in the train going to Wimbledon.
      I feel terrible: cold very thick, neuralgia, headache. I fear
      I must cancel Banstead tonight. If I keep on working late at night
      I shall never throw the bloody thing off. Perhaps tea with rum
      will do it tonight.

      I note with relief & pleasure what Tiny says about the lease
      of 46. I suppose 20 years is not much out of 70 after all.
      That's excellent.

      The train is drawing near to London Bridge. I must close.
      I love you.

      love you
      Lawrence
