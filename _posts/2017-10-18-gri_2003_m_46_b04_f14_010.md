    clean_transcription: 2  I shall probably work on Tiny<br/>on Wednesday.  I am
      at present<br/>working on a water-colour of the<br/>Regency Jug in the library
      and hope<br/>to finish it this afternoon.  I have<br/>been doing seasonal odd
      jobs like<br/>making marmalade and patch-<br/>ing the carpet in one hall--also<br/>I
      have been to Hastings 3 times<br/>for various shopping--I have<br/>bought the
      draped suit pattern<br/>that I admired--and some blue<br/>grey stuff for it
      with a diagonal<br/>weave.  I will send you a pattern.<br/>I shall also buy
      some shoes.<br/>Clifford went to wipples and ordered<br/>a suit which cost 35!!  He
      has<br/>been rather depressed ever since<br/>though he preached such a good<br/>sermon
      today that it cheered<br/>even him up!<br/>Please could your good 2 forms<br/>for
      the "RI of Painter in Waterclours"<br/>Please.
