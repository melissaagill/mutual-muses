      I wish I were with you while you painted at the Oak and in the garden. I remember

      is the poem about H.M., rather influenced by Ezra P. I don't think it is success-ful
      really but I am glad I tried it.\n\nIn the two days at home I have written a
      film article about Strangers on a Train and His Kind of Woman: both have sorts
      of doppelganger. I have quite finished the part concerning the former - a little
      remains of the latter to do. (Perhaps I can finish it in the train today.) I
      am planning also an article comparing Sartre's Morts sans sepulchres and an
      American prison film Brute Force.\n\nClifford and Marjorie's reaction to the

      They seem to be persecuting the girl. Are they guilty? I take it they must be.
      I quite agree with you about having a soft spot for Carol and I do not think
      for one moment that she thinks you foolish for it. My impression is that she
      appreciated you very much indeed.\n\nYour dreams express exactly how I feel
      also. I long to see you. I thought of you last night very passionately for I
