      SONG FOR SYLVIA
      Fore shortened lovers see their teats and toes
      And in between the mound of Venus
      On that poetical member of the range
      From which the Hippocrene cascades

      The [unclear]lawn[/unclear] of flesh breaks the paper hymen
      Prudish custom holds across the ring
      Leap Minerva through the ring-mastered top hat
      Acrobat of knowledge and desire

      Lovers' contrposto is a tangle
      Only those in the [unclear]?[/unclear] can unravel
      But we will stay tied and never open
      The parcels underneath of solitude

      THE LION AS HERMIT
      The world was created to tempt and test
      Church fathers in the [unclear]lurching[/unclear] desert:
      The caves, the flora, and the clouds
      Were only there to snare the guilty flesh

      So I am tested by the flooded fields,
      The lochs and vegetation of the miles
      Which separate me [unclear]not[/unclear] from fictive god,
      But from my love, rural, distant, watery

      The charm of flesh breaks the paper hymen

      SONG FOR SYLVIA

      And in between the mound of Venus
      On, that poetical member of the range
      From which the Hippocrene cascades

      The lawn of flesh breaks the paper hymen
      Prudish custom hold across the ring
      Leap Ninerna through the ring-masters top hat
      Acobat of knowledge and desire

      Lovers' contraposts is a tangle
      Only those in the knot can unravel
      But we will stay tied and never open
      The parces underneath of solitude.

      THE LION AS HERMIT

      The world was created to tempt and test
      Church fathers in the lurching desert:
      The caves, the jeara, & the clouds
      Were only there to snare the guilty flesh.

      SoI am tested by the flooded fields,
      The locks and vegetation of the miles
      Which separate me, not from fictine god,
      But from my love, rural, distant, waiting.

      SONG FOR SYLVIA

      Fore shortened lovers see their teats and toes
      And in between the mound of Venus
      On that poetical member of the range
      From which the Hippocrene cascades

      The clown of flesh breaks the paper hymen
      Prudish Custom holds across the ring
      leap Minerva through the ring-master's top hat
      Acrobat of knowledge and desire

      Lover's contraposto in a tangle
      Only those in the knot can unravel
      But we will stay tied and never open
      The parcels underneath of solitude.

      THE LION AS HERMIT

      The world was created to tempt and test
      Church fathers in the lurching desert:
      The canes, the flora, & the clouds
      Were only there to snare the guilty flesh.

      So I am tested by the flooded fields,
      The lochs and vegetation of the miles
      which separate me, not from fictive god,
      But from my love, rural, distant, waiting.
