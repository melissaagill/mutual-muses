      Petrarchan Compliment in a Native Form:

      Ambling along asymmerrical lanes
      With Marjorie in the month of March
      To where on the map a kissing-gate crosses
      The path from Pett to the Smuggler's Porch
      Travel like treasure, desired but untouched,
      Because of the lions blue between cloud-lilies.
      No Anti-Christ curses [unclear][/unclear] the church
      Vigilant of vice and virtue on the ridge.
      Shaggy towers of stinging nettles surround
      The kissing gate hanging on rusty hinges.
      O in a landscape of light bouncing on leaves
      To come on a gate to be rescued from ruin.
      In a derelict world I limped in a dream
      Through crinoline hoops and cracking harbours:
      Wide boys and widows lay under walls,
      Fallen from windows or has they been pushed.
      'breath from his lips boils in the air', wondered a bride[unclear][/unclear].
      'Take pity on our pieces', pleaded the city.
      But I left them all in the lee of sleep,
      Free of furze and nettle I found the gate
      And once I went into its opened arms
      I met the landscape, mild in March, the country
      Where you wander while I dream of maps.

      Petrarchan Compliment in a Native Form:

      Ambling along asymmetrical lanes
      With Marjorie in the month of March
      To where on the map a kissing-gate crosses
      The path from Pett to the Smuggler's Perch
      Travel like treasures, desired but untouched,
      Because of the lions blue between cloud-lilies.
      No Anti-Christ curses the church
      Vigilant of vice and virtue on the ridge.
      Shaggy towers of stinging nettles surround
      The kissing gate hanging on rusty hinges.
      O in a landscape of light bouncing on leaves
      To come on a gate to be rescued from ruin.
      In a derelict world I limped in a dream
      Through crinoline hoops and cracking harbours:
      Wide boys and widows lay under walls,
      Fallen from windows or had they been pushed.
      'Breath from his lips boils in the air', wondered a bride.
      'Take pity on our pieces', pleaded the city.
      But I left them all in the lee of sleep.
      Free of furze and nettle I found the gate
      And once I went into its opened arms
      I met the landscape, mild in March, the country
      Where you wander while I dream of maps.
