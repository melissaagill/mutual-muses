    clean_transcription: Pett 2.3.51<br/>Dearest Lawrence,<br/>As I shall need your
      help with luggage and pictures I shall catch the 9.0 - which will I think arrive
      about 12 o'clock - I will check. <br/>I have been to the 'bus office and the
      time at Lewisham is 11.38. I should be so grateful if you could manage to meet
      me. I will try not to have a heavy suitcase. There is no later 'bus.<br/>Thank
      you so much for your letter and for sending the form.<br/>I am amused and horrified
      by your Chelmsofrd hosts.<br/>I hope you had a pleasant and successful time
      with Ithyl - I wonder if you went to the dance! I hope you did as it would be
