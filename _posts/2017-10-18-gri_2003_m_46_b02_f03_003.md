           I [unclear]ravy[/unclear] John: he went to Cambridge
      and while there, he said, got 'flu.
      He will look after the books. He seems
      very friendly. Unreliable he certainly
      is, but of his friendliness we cannot
      doubt either, I think. We must judge the
      two aspects of his nature when dealing
      with him in future.

           After you left yesterday I went
      to Gainsborough's. He was not there so
      I shall write to him, suggesting a review
      of the Guercino book.   It was a curious
      sensation being without you. I felt
      nothing at all except a kind of detachment
      and indifference. Your problem, of course,
      is entirely different, my sweetheart.

           The weather here is fitful with ex-
      citing fast moving clouds. St Pancras
      is far behind with its queer shape and
      queer detail. Here cloud shadows
      more pleasantly on the countryside
      visible from the train.

           I am nearly at H. I must gather
      my 'things' together.

           I love you, my dearest Sylvia, and will write again very shortly.

           I love you - Lawrence
