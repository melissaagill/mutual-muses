      2   and I must say I miss it.

      Thank you very much for your letter and
      delightful poem.

      [unclear]Tiny[/unclear] has been too busy bottling to sit
      for me, but no doubt she will at the
      end of the week.

      Shall I bring all my paintings with
      me?  Do you think Miller will want
      to see some more - I've a good mind
      to write and ask him.  Shall I
      send something in to the S. E A. ?
      [unclear]For[/unclear] October the 1st I think.

      I am interested in the "Western" idea
      don't forget the "Fallacy of Height".

      The Rebuilding at the Redfern is most
      unlucky for me - I fear they may
      not have time put mine up before
      the next exhibition.

      Dearest Lawrence, forgive me to-day
      if my letter is short but I must
      go back to my roses.

      Please will you tell me which of
      the books you wanted me to bring.

      Dear Poet - I love you so - my
      Lawrence, dear love.

      I love you
      Sylvia.

      and I must say I miss it.
      Thank you very much for your letter and delightful poem.
      Tiny has been too busy battling to sit for me, but no doubt she will at the end of the week.
      Shall I bring all my paintings with me? Do you think Miller will want to see some more - I've a good mind to write and ask him. Shall I send something in to the S.E.A.? It's October the 1st I think.
      I am interested in the "Western" idea don't forget the "Fallacy of Heights"
      The rebuilding at the Redfern is most [unclear]unlucky[/unclear] for me - I fear they may not have time to put mine up before the next exhibition.
      Dearest Lawrence, forgive me to-day if my letter is short but I must go back to my roses.
      Please will you tell me which of the books you wanted me to bring.
      Dear Poet - I love you so - my Lawrence, dear love.
      I love you
      Sylvia
