      Saturday 28th: Jugoslav. lecture.
      Sunday 29: T.G. lecture - special party
      Monday 30:  [unclear]Morpenden[/unclear]
      Tuesday 1DEC:  TG public lecture
      Wed 2  NG and BANSTead.
      Thur 3  TG
      Fri 4  Walnerhampton, 1.

      In addition I must send off the next US Alt News article by
      the 5th - before if possible - and write the Painting, 1953 piece
      for the Encycl. Brit. by the 8th.  (The Walnerhampton lecture
      will take quite a bit of work, too, being of a pair I am doing,
      as you know.)  With all that ahead of me I should feel
      easier and be able to be so much more attentive if we go
      to [unclear]Giorgious[/unclear] on 10th.  You do understand my darling? let
      me know your feeling about it.
      Lion must go to town (lantern slides at the V & A) as usual.
      Think of me.  You are never out of my thoughts.
      love and adore you
      Lawrence

      P.S.   I enclose my Klee piece.
