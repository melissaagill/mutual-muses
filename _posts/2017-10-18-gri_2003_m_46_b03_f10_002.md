Consequently neither they nor I enjoyed it particularly & the discussion was faltering, the chairman half-baked. My previous impressions of Redcar are amply confirmed.

      Glacial bedroom, as usual, at Redcar but excellent food and this time I am able to do justice to it.

      Redcar I XI 50
      Dearest Sylvia
      Perhaps I shall hear soon, I go to Whitby this afternoon, of your picture at the S.E.A. exhibition. I long to hear that it is accepted: it certainly deserves to be form your account of it and from the dazzling, luminous standard of all your work that I do know.
      My lecture last night was, I think, excellently shaped & phrased but the small audience did not make up in quality what it lacked in quantity.  Consequently neither they nor I enjoyed it particularly & the discussion was faltering, the [unclear]claim[/unclear] half-baked. My previous impressions of Redcar are amply confirmed.
      I enclose 2 drawings of Dandy. The lanes one can [unclear]c[/unclear] little of the extensive desolation of the Yorkshire coast for mile after mile: everything exudes smoke except the pieces that are thrown away is they rot and rust between the active places. Mist and red sunshine invest the area with a perverse beauty - somewhere between melancholy AND the sublime.
      Glacial bedroom, as usual, at Redcar but plenty of excellent food and this time I am able to do justice to it.
      Donald Matlis, the Regional director, seems charming and apparently Miss Chick is to blame for  my lack of information about the places I am lecturing in for she seems to have neglected to forward me information the regional offices sent her.
      Did you know that last night was Hallo e'en, or however it is spelt. Even the warlocks were too busy to come to the lecture. I imagine it was pretty noisy and disturbed at Pett...
      It is almost lunch time so I shall stop now and finish my packing. Dandy sends you a great big hug and all, all his love. I adore you my dearest love & I hope that you are well and strong.
      I love you
      Lawrence
