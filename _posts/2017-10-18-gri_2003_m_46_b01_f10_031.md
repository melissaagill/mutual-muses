      11, Mansel Road,
                  Wimbledon.
      16th November, 1946

      Dearest Sylvia,

          Thank you so much for my weekend. What a pleasure it is to see, hear, touch you and talk to you instead of thinking about you and writing. Your presence, your expressions and gestures, are so vivid and loving. I was pleased that you came to Hastings with me: my heart broke as the bus drew away and you vanished. Oh I love you Sylvia, without reservation I love you.

          As we said I would I wrote a poem in the train which I have just revised. It is called AT HASTINGS:

      Leaving the promenade and the flat
        Horizon-hugging sea
      Fraying into a surf of seagulls
        We turned inland to shops
      Laden with tables mirrors chairs
        Staffordshire gentlemen
      And cups fluted like a ram's horn.
        Remark, a chiffonier,
      A Bew[unclear]i[/unclear]ck book, a pepper pot
        A classical landscape --
      Fainted blue upon a plate --
        Where lovers edge round lakes
      Spanned by perilous slanted planks.
        These tempt, these take the eye.

        The poet looking at houses --
      Wishing for a painter's eloquence --
        Looks hastily for words
      To catch the cadence of perspective,
        A three-storeyed bow
      Elegant as the upraised arm
        Of Madame Moitessier,
      The scooped shell of a white porch,
        And frames his pleasure at
      Each linear verandah.
        Fanlights radiate like fonts
      Or ferms above the wellworn doors
        Of terraces that own
      Allegiance to a reasoned past
        And to this wilder time.
      In the foreground my vivid muse
        Commends topography.

      Now I must away to town but I shall write again this evening. I love you, dearest,
                              I love you - Lawrence

      16th November, 1948

      Dearest Sylvia,

      Thank you so much for my weekend. What a pleasure it
      is to see, hear, touch you and talk to you instead of
      thinking about you and writing. Your presence, your
      expressions and gestures, are so vivid and loving. I
      was pleased that you came to Hastings with me: my heart
      broke as the bus drew away and you vanished. Oh I love
      you Sylvia, without reservation I love you.

      As we said I would I wrote a poem in the train which
      I have just revised. It is called AT HASTINGS:

      Leaving the promenade and the flat
      Horizon-hugging sea
      Fraying into a surf of seagulls
      We turned inland to shops
      Laden with tables mirrors chairs
      Staffordshire gentlemen
      And cups fluted like a ram's horn.
      A [unclear]Bewick[/unclear] book, a pepper pot,
      A classical landscape -
      Painted blue upon a plate -
      Where lovers edge round lakes
      Spanned by perilous slanted planks.
      These tempt, these take the eye.

      The poet looking at houses -
      Wishing for a painter's eloquence -
      Looks hastily for words
      To catch the cadence of perspective,
      A three-storeyed bow
      Elegant as the upraised arm
      Of Madame Moitessier,
      The scooped shell of a white porch,
      And frames his pleasure at
      Each linear verandah.
      Fanlights radiate like fonts
      Or ferns above the wellworn doors
      Of terraces that own
      Allegiance to a reasoned past
      And to this wilder time.
      In the foreground my vivid muse
      Comends topography.

      Sylvia,<br/><br/>Thank you so much for my weekend. What a pleasure it<br/>is
      to see, hear, touch you and talk to you instead of<br/>thinking about you and
      writing. Your presence, your<br/>expressions and gestures, are so vivid and
      loving. I<br/>was pleased that you came to Hastings with me: my heart<br/>broke
      as the bus drew away and you vanished. Oh I love<br/>you Sylvia, without reservation
      I love you.<br/><br/>As we said I would I wrote a poem in the train which<br/>I
      have just revised. It is called AT HASTINGS:<br/><br/>Leaving the promenade
      and the flat<br/>Horizon-hugging sea<br/>Fraying into a surf of seagulls<br/>We
      turned inland to shops<br/>Laden with tables mirrors chairs<br/>Staffordshire
      gentlemen<br/>And cups fluted like a ram''s horn.<br/>A Bewick book, a pepper
      pot,<br/>A classical landscape -<br/>Painted blue upon a plate -<br/>Where lovers
      edge round lakes<br/>Spanned by perilous slanted planks.<br/>These tempt, these
      take the eye.<br/><br/>The poet looking at houses -<br/>Wishing for a painter''s
      eloquence -<br/>Looks hastily for words<br/>To catch the cadence of perspective,<br/>A
      three-storeyed bow<br/>Elegant as the upraised arm<br/>Of Madame Moitessier,<br/>The
      scooped shell of a white porch,<br/>And frames his pleasure at<br/>Each linear
      verandah.<br/>Fanlights radiate like fonts<br/>Or ferns above the wellworn doors<br/>Of
      terraces that own<br/>Allegiance to a reasoned past<br/>And to this wilder time.<br/>In
      the foreground my vivid muse<br/>Comends topography.<br/><br/>Now I must away
      to town I shall write again this evening. I love you, dearest,<br/>I love you
      - Lawrence'
