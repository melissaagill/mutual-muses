      Pelt

      Dearest Lawrence,
      I am delighted to hear about
      the lectures at the Tate though
      I wish that it was more exciting
      financially!  She found quite interest-
      ing to her and I imagine will
      not mean to much study for
      you.  I am very pleased about
      the I.C.A. discussions -- particularly
      of Reads book.  I think I should
      do "growth and form" if you can
      it would be nice to do something
      with Sylvestere and I think you
      should have something very interesting
      to say.
      I will enclose a p.o. to pay
      for the [unclear][/unclear] -- I do think thats quick
      tell me if it is not enough.
      I hope tiny will sit for me when
      I have posted this
