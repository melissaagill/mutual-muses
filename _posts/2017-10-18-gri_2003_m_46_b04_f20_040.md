      applied to the N.G. and will\napply for the Tate - (which) - the\nlatter, would
      suit you very well I\nshould think. I wonder if Reyner-\nBanham will be after
      it (he doesn't\nappear to have a Christian name!) I\nnotice in Art News that
      he is lectur-\ning at the Tate this week on the\nPre-Raphaelites and Alfred
      Stevens -\n(in reverse order). Have you seen\nGainsborough - R.-B. seems to
      get\nan awful lot of work for Art News\nhe seems to have a feature every week.\nI
      am so glad that you are\n"
