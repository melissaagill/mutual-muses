      that old romantic comedy (I can't remember its name) in which they sink an ocean liner at the end of the film to bring the lovers together.  In all I consider the exam rather in that light.

           Did I tell you that last Tuesday I went to hear one of my rivals for the relief-relief lectures at the Gallery but she didn't turn up and at 11.15 Clare appeared.  So the battle narrows -it appears.  I'm full of Zumbaran.  I rate him above your [unclear]Zeille-on points[/unclear], I must confess.  I wish you were going to be in the audience with your curls -- occasionally challenging an opinion or hasty judgment.

           I am working on about three sonnets for you at present.  All of them rhyming - I feel that every poetic manner must be enlisted in your praise.   You might like to know that the couplet in lines 9-10 is a French and not an English habit.  I love you and I must polish them up before sending them to you so that Minerva will see a clear image of herself in them.  like a mirror can project for your portrait.
