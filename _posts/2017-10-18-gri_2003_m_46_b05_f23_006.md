      Dearest Lawrence,
      Your post is still being re-directed here, and I rushed to the post this morning to send it back - including a letter of mine which I had hoped you would get for the week-end. I hope the one I sent off yesterday will reach you direct. I will see miss [unclear][/unclear] about it if any more come.
      I very much appreciated the review and was delighted to have it so soon - and I am so disappointed that you have not had my letters.
      I will find out trains to-morrow, I think I will come to you on Saturday -
