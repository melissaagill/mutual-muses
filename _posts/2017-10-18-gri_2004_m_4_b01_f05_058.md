      one dull, Banstead successful) and Thursday I went to see Gainsborough. He wants
      me to do a regular fortnightly column covering the sale rooms. It will mean

      you. You have the rebus right as far as you go but there is another word in

      means the begonia):\nTonight we cannot sleep with the doors open \nFor wind
      will tear the pages of the books\nImpair the equilibrium of flowers\nAnd shuttle
      icebergs down the lovers' spines\nInside the mountain guiltless Venusberg\nLovers
      survive despite the distant sun\nAnd for the winter we must love behind\nThe
      frosted panes of glass and undercover\n\n'What a pity', says Hetty, 'that I
      am not suitable for the portrait exhibition\". I think she is tired of only
      having me to admire her and wishes for your good opinion again.\n\nThe exhibition
      for John is finished and he likes it. Miss Chic must read it and then we have

      of my time early this week; Wednesday I had two lectures (the school one dull,
      Banstead successful) and Thursday I went to see Gainsbourough. He wants me to
      do a regular fortnightly coloumn covering the sale rooms. It will mean a constant

      Blackheath
      Sunday

      Dearest Sylvia,

      I am glad my poems please you. You have the rebus right as far as you go but there is another word in it. Here is another poem - a Wintry one - without any riddles (the third lines means the begonia):

      Tonight we cannot sleep with the doors open
      For wind will tear the pages of the books
      Impair the equilibrium of flowers
      And shuttle icebergs down the lovers' spires

      Inside the mountain guiltless Venusberg
      Lovers survive despite the distant sun
      And for the Winter we must love behind
      The frosted panes of glass and undercover

      'What a pity', says Betty, 'that I am not suitable for the portrait exhibition'. I think she is tired of only having me to admire her and wishes for your good opinion again.

      The exhibition for John is finished and he likes it. Miss Chick must read it and then we have to see Gabriel White about it in whom rests the lAST WORD. It took up a lot of my time early this week; Wednesday I had two lectures (the school one dull, Banstead successful) and Thursday I went to see Gainsborough. He wants me to do a regular fortnightly column covering the sale rooms. It will mean a constant to guinea cheque. I have also reviewed the Towne exhibition for Gainsborough: he asked after you last time I saw him.

      The LSE class, did I tell you? I can't remember, was a success and they want me to go again next term.
