    annotation_text: "Blackheath\nMonday                          March 17th 52\nDearest
      Sylvia\n  Thank you for your letter with the welcome news that your cold is
      almost gone. I am glad to hear it. And how are your sleeping? Poor Clifford
      - a cold on top of everything else. I hope he is not too tired to get rid of
      it quickly. As for Tiny - I could shake her really! Gloomy again - and yet being
      cheered up by Miss Peace! Oh well: the main thing is that she has cheered up.
      \n  Good for George: the dresses sound very nice, especially the navy and white
      one. Do you need to do much work on them? They sound in a good state. I am glad
      you found Esther Waters at Ditchling: I am amused you missed a train because
      of the book's fascinations. The other night I went to [unclear]Lea[/unclear]
      instead of Blackheath in the train because I was immersed in Moby Dick: so,
      we are a pair! Incidentally I am reading Tennyson's Princess: and do you know
      in what edition? That little soft-covered book from Pett. We looked through
      it, and you sang your lion a Tennyson song about Owls. \n  At Petersfield I
      glimpsed Looking at Pictures - the Arts Council exhibition I designed. EXH.
      is the art-historical abbreviation for exhibition.\n  Saturday night Father
      & I (Mother being at a Dance) saw Out-cast of the Islands again. Afterwards
      I missed my train home so had to stay the night. In the morning I had to take
      Father to Nel-son Hospital because a splinter under his nail refused to come
      out. Casualty soon removed it, however, and he was alright again.\n  I have
      read an entire book on Rodin. Tomorrow's lecture is nearly ready now. I spent
      a nice evening with Turnbull last week: he admires Giacometti but thinks him
      Gothic, life-denying. He wants a more life-enhancing art: those were not his
      words but that is what he meant.\n  This afternoon I am going to the Charlton
      to Lewisham libraries. Then back home to read Rodin's own book ART. \n  I saw
      Mrs Cregan's Saturday lecture. It was smaller than my Saturday lectures, although
      the subject was Impressionism! Did I tell you, by the way, that I have a 9th
      lecture this week? 1 Tuesday: 3 Wednesday: 2 Thursday: 3 Saturday."

      Blackheath
      Monday

      Dearest Sylvia
      Thank you for your letter with the welcome news that your cold is
      almost gone. I am glad to hear it. And how are you sleeping?
      Poor Clifford - a cold on top of everything else. I hope he is not too
      tired to get rid of it quickly. As for Tiny - I could shake her really!
      Glooming again - and yet being cheered up by Miss Peace! Oh well: the
      main thing is that she has cheered up.
      Good for George: the dresses sound very nice, especially the long
      and white one. Do you need to do much work on them? They sound in
      a good state. I am glad you found Esther Waters at Ditchling: I
      am amused you missed the train because of the book's fascination.
      The other night I went to Lex instead of Blackheath on the train because I was
      immersed in Moby Dick: so, we are a pain! Incidentally, I am
      reading Tennyson's Princess: and do you know what edition?
      That little soft-covered book from Pett. We looked through it,
      and you sang your lion a Tennyson song about owls.
      At Petersfield I glimpsed Looking at Pictures - the Arts Council
      exhibition I designed. EXH. is the art-historical abbreviation for
      exhibition.
      Saturday night Father & I (mother being at a Dance) saw Out-
      cast of the Islands again. Afterwards, I missed my train home so
      had to stay the night. In the morning I had to take Father to Nel-
      son Hospital because a splinter under his nail refused to come out.
      [unclear]Casualty[/unclear] soon removed it, however, and he was alright again.
      I have read an entire book on Rodin. Tomorrow's lecture is
      nearly ready now. I spent a nice evening with Turnbull last
      week: he admired Giacometti but thinks him gothic, life-denying.
      This afternoon I am going to the Charlton & Lewisham [unclear]library[/unclear].
      Then back home to read Rodin's own book ART.
      I saw Mrs. Cregan's Saturday lecture. It was smaller than
      my Saturday lecture, although the subject was impressionism!
      Did I tell you, by the way, that I have a 9th lecture this
      week? 1 Tuesday: 3 Wednesday: 2 Thursday: 3 Saturday.

      Blackheath
      Monday
      Dearest Sylvia
      Thank you for your letter with the welcome news that your cold is almost gone. I am glad to hear it. And how are you sleeping? Poor Clifford - a cold on top of everything else. I hope he is not too tired to get rid of it quickly. As for Tiny - I could shake her really! Gloomy again - and yet being cheered up by Miss Peace! Oh well; the main thing is that she has cheered up.
      Good for George; the dresses sound very nice, especially the [unclear]rory[/unclear] and white one. Do you need to do much work on them? They sound in a good state. I am glad you found Esther Waters at Ditching; I am amused you missed a train because of the book's fascination. The other night I went to Lee instead of Blackheath in the train because I was immersed in Moby Dick; so, we are a pair! Incidentally I am reading Tennyson's 'Princess'; and do you know in what edition? That little soft-covered book from Pett. We looked through it, and you sang your lion a Tennyson song about owls.
      At Petersfield I glimpsed Looking at Pictures - the Arts Council exhibition I designed. EXH is the art-historical abbreviation for exhibition.
      Saturday night Father & I (Mother being at a Dance) saw Outcast Of The Islands again. Afterwards I missed my train home so had to stay the night. In the morning I had to take Father to Nelson Hospital because a splinter under his nail refused to come out. Casualty soon removed it, however, and he was alright again.
      I have read an entire book on Rodin. Tomorrow's lecture is nearly ready now. I spent a nice evening with Turnbull last week; he admires Giacometti but thinks him Gothic, life-denying. He wants a more life-enhancing art; those were not his words but that is what he meant.
