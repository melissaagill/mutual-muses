      3rd February 1949  Blackheath

      Dearest Sylvia,

      I am enchanted with news of your new painting - I am glad that you are working so well. It sounds a lovely thing - delicious thoughts of the colour come into my head as I write this. I am glad you think of your two drawings done here as studies for oils - the trees in the landscape in particular which you drew so well.

      I cannot send the Bosch, though I should like to, as the only copy is in Gainsborough's hands. When it is published I'll send the Woods a copy with pleasure though.

      Ruskin complains of 'base Renaissance architects' who 'covered their work with comic masks and musical instruments'. As I have been looking at Villa Madama and Vatican Loggia photographs I wrote the following for you - GROTESQUE. Its long think shape is meant to give it a pilaster's leanness and flatness.

      A sphinx grows
      Into a rose
      Stucco putti
      Lounge or flutter
      Among festoons
      Of honeysuckle
      Hung with lanterns'
      Dazzling buckles
      Amoretti
      Sit on parrots
      Music-trophies
      Hang on trees
      And of the battle
      Lute and lorica
      Score and helmet
      Bells and comets
      Wings and petals
      Tassels eyes
      Flasks of scarlet
      Anatomies
      Nuptial vase
      Immense guitars
      Tambourines
      Tangerines
      Curlicues
      And Cameos
      An odalisque
      Behind bars
      In a silver cage
      Motive of captivity

      Dearest Sylvia,
             I am enchanted with the news of your new painting - I am glad that you are working so well. It sounds a lovely thing - delicious thoughts of the colour come into my head as I write this.

             Ruskin complains of 'base Renaissance architects' who 'covered their work with masks and musical instruments'. As I have been looking at Villa Madama and Vatican Loggia photographs I wrote the following for you - GROTESQUE. Its long thin shape is meant to give it a pilaster's leanness and flatness.

As I have been looking at Villa Madama and Vatican Loggia photographs I wrote the following for you - GROTESQUE. It's long thin shape is ment to give it a pilaster's leanness and flatness.
