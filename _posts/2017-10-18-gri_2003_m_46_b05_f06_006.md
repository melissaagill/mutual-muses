      Blackheath

      Monday

      Dearest Sylvia,

      Thank you very much for your letter. I am so very pleased to hear Clifford's portrait is going so well and that you are about to start on your theatrical picture.  The weather here yesterday was rotten but so far today (It is eleven o'clock) it is sunny, though with a slight wind: so perhaps you may be able to finish your beach scene soon. I hope so for I admired it so much.

      Delighted to hear that the digging I did in the garden has been a help. I wll do some more when I come. It is this evening I shall learn for sure that I can come. I hope I can: I expect I can.

      Of course I shall go the Kensington Gallery, in the course of a day or two I shall make a special journey to the Salon. I will tell you all about it.

      Thank you for 'The Times' cutting: I have not read the article yet but I like the pictures very much. I do agree with you about the Ramsey: it is very French but I cannot quite think which Frenchman. Duplessis, perhaps: you remember his Gluck portrait from Vienna?

      Here are some poems: the first six are Pett poems. The sequence is not quite complete. If I have taken a long time about them it is because I am trying to make them genuinely simple and terse. The other two poems are occasional: one a memory of the road up and of the tube, is anti-urban;  the other deals with the popular defiled woman them of Stanley and Stella, and 'Sanctuary', and 'No Orchids'.

      Father looked in last night and was very amiable. Today as you know Robert is coming. I plan to do the shopping this morning, put Antal away (!) , and do some work before he comes for tea.

      I am reading, a chapter a night in bed, 'A Cycle of Cathay', an American book about Chinese influence on Europe, especially England, in 17th and 18th centuries. Apparently at a time when 'chineiserie' was popular the Deists admired Confucious for his rationalism.

      I love and adore you, Sylvia, I adore you,
      Lawrence

      Monday

      Dearest Sylvia,

      Thank you very much for your letter.  I am so very
      pleased to hear Clifford's portrait is going so well and
      that you are about to start on your theatrical picture.
      The weather here yesterday was rotten but so far today
      (it is eleven o'clock) it is sunny, though with a slight
      wind:  so perhaps you may be able to finish your beach
      scene soon.  I hope so for I admired it so much.

      Delighted to hear that the digging I did in the gar-
      den has been a help.  I will do some more when I come.
      It is this evening I shall learn for sure that I can come.
      I hope I can:  I expect I can.

      Of course I shall go the Kensington Gallery, in the
      course of a day or two I shall make a special journey to
      the Salon.  I will tell you all about it.

      agree with you about the Ramsey:  it is very French but

      aps:  you remember his Gluck portrait from Vienna?
