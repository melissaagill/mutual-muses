      Dearest Sylvia
         I love you so much and long to see you in 4 days time:  Saturday (when I am going to the V&A & Wimbledon), Sunday, Monday (working at home on [unclear]bath [/unclear]days), and TUESDAY when I see you at last.  I hope the time goes quickly until Tuesday - then I wish it to move slowly.
         I saw Parsons last night.  We have talked over a project and should start work on it next week.  I'll tell you all about it when we meet.  He lives in Paddington, in a charming flat & with a charming wife.  I think there is no reason why we should not get on well & get a book written smoothly:  or very little time.
