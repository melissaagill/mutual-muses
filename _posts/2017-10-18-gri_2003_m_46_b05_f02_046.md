      Dearest Sylvia
      Lion is writing in the drawing room - your enchanting Venetian
      watercolour on the wall facing me. How it remindsme of those
      afternoons sitting on the steps of St Maria Maggiore, a few [unclear]metres[/unclear]
      above the water slapping the stone languidly.
      Yesterday, after the lecture (at least 70 people), Father took me
      to see Dieu a besoin des hommes (which in English means Isle
      of Sinners!). I enjoyed it enormously. Pierre Fresnay plays
      brilliantly the man in a primitive Breton community who [unclear]they[/unclear],
      takes on the duties of priest when the '[unclear][/unclear]' of the is -
      hardens makes the pastor leave impatient. His conflict of
      respectful superstition and 'spiritual pride' is touchingly
      handled (tho' perhaps Clifford would not be very sympathetic).
      He is forced to confess, someone absolves them, and, finally, is
      almost forced in the sacrilege of [unclear]mass[/unclear]. Then the [unclear]painter[/unclear] comes
      but the islanders prefer the [unclear]lay man[/unclear]: 'what we tell you
      goes straight to God - not back to the mainland', as one
      sinner puts it. Lying to the police is not a sin' the 'lay'
      priest tells them. No wonder they prefer hi,. Jean Delannoy
      (who directed L'Eternal Retour) made the film.
      I have not got your letter here so I cannot answer the
      points in it (I will in my next letter) but, thank you so
      much for your long letter.
      The Tate have some new acquisitions not yet on view - a
      hideous Lucian Freud and some new Sironi's - I believe of
      the third that we saw in Milan  admired so much. I have not
      seen them yet but I am hopeful. The Director is going to
      Paris shortly; last time he went Giacometti  Picasso works
      were purchased. Keep your fingers crossed.
      No cheque yet unfortunately I shall remind Birmingham
      so it should come fairly soon. I die psychologically every
      time we part. I am congealed and inert without you.
      I love you so much and ache for our next meeting.
      My ravishing love I adore you.

      Wimbeldon
      Sunday
      Dearest Sylvia
      Lion is writing in the drawing room - your enchanting Venetian watercolour on the wall facing me. How it reminds me of those afternoons sitting on the steps of St Maria Maggiano, a few inches above the water slapping the stone languidly.
      Yesterday, after the lecture (at least 70 people), Father took me to see Dieu a Besoin des Hommes (which in English means Isle of Sinners!). I enjoyed it enormously. Pierre Fresnay plays brilliantly the man in a primitive Breton community who, tho' lay, takes on the duties of priest when the 'barbarity' of the islanders makes the pastor leave in protest. His conflict of respectful superstition and 'spiritual pride' is touchingly handled (tho' perhaps Clifford would not be very sympathetic). He is forced to confess someone, absolve them, and, finally, is almost forced to the sacrilege of mass. Then the pastor comes but the islanders prefer the lay man - 'what we tell you goes straight to God - not back to the mainland', as one sinner puts it. 'Lying to the police is not a sin' the 'lay' priest tells them - no wonder they prefer him. Jean Delannoy (who directed L'éternel Retour) made the film.
      I have not got your letter here so I cannot answer the points in it (I will in my next letter) but, thank you so much for your long letter.
      The Tate have some new acquisitions not yet on view; a hideous Lucien Freud and some new Sironi's - I believe of the kind that we saw in Milan & admired so much. I have not seen them yet but I am hopeful. The Director is going to Paris shortly - last time he went Giacometti & Picasso works were purchased. Keep your fingers crossed.
      No cheque yet unfortunately. I shall remind Birmingham so it should come fairly soon. I die psychologically every time we part: I am congealed and inert without you. I love you so much and ache for our next meeting.

This conflict of respectful superstition and 'spiritual pride' is touchingly handled (tho' perhaps Clifford would be very sympathetic).

Then Dr. Porter comes but the islanders prefer the lay man: 'what we tell you goes straight to God - not back to the mainland', as one sinner puts it. 'lying to the police is not a sin' the 'lay' priest tells them: no wonder they prefer him. Sean Delanvey (who directed L'Eternel [unclear]Retous)[/unclear] made the film.
