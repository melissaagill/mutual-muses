      3 Sitting on the little tiled terrace outside

      yesterday too. - St. Luke's summer -

      I painted for a short time - just over
      an hour yesterday morning and this
      morning and I hope I shall paint
      longer to-morrow but I haven't felt
      well enough to stand very long.
      I have now finished the gate, and
      shall work on the fence next, then
      build up the hedge - which is mainly
      brambles - back against the sunny
      vista with details of reflected light
      [unclear]in[/unclear] leaves, then the sunny wood is the fore
      -ground with its cast shadow. I
      love you so well - and paint for you.
      Tiny was back and we were so
      happy to see her - and I think it
      cheered her up to be here again and
      also tell me all about it! She
      came looking dreadful - and so thin -
      we have I think persuaded her of
      the importance of this and she will
      try to eat more instead of smoking quite
      so much. She is very depressed about
