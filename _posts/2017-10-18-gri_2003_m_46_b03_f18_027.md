      Dearest Lawrence,
      Like a fool I did not remember your Birmingham lecture; I do hope you are not too rushed in preparing for it. I hope it is a great success and you have a pleasant time in Birmingham. Are you coming down here after Birmingham - I hope you are - we should all be delighted to see you. If not I fear I cannot come until Tuesday afternoon . So i hope you can.
      My pictures from the Kensington need to be collected either on Saturday morning or Monday. If you come I will ask them to keep them until Tuesday for me. If not perhaps you could fetch them - could you let me know.
      We have been going to Clifford's lectures which are, of course, very good indeed - I have taken notes.
