      Yes I have seen Le Corbeau and enjoyed it very much.

      You must be tired after your wonderfully industrious days in Paris.  If you feel tired do have a rest now and again even if it means missing an altarpiece or two.  Your journey to Italy  - starting at midnight - sounds shocking but I expect you will have recovered by now (thursday).

      by now (thursday). "
