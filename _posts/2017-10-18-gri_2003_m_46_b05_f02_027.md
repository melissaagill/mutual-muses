      Here are some fragments:
      Rapport of lips & weather
      of baskets raised on the head -
      And so carried. Falling tents
      of flesh sucked by lightning.

      and
      The marmalade of orchards
      Unites with the speed of glass

      and
      The night splayed like heads on my corner.
      A one-track warning trained my patience.
      The among the hoardings of 12 o'clock
      The phallus of Rimbaud came to rule
      Graffiti of the Kingless Town.

      and
      The clothes-horse of fatigue gouges my scalp.

      (I think they will go into a poem about
      Journeys and Cities - something of that
      kind.)

      weather<br/>of baskets raised on the head -<br/>And so carried. Falling tents<br/>of
      flesh sucked by lightning.<br/><br/>and<br/>The marmalade of orchards<br/>Unites
      with the speed of glass<br/><br/>and<br/>The night splayed like heads on my
      corner.<br/>A one-track warning trained my patience.<br/>The among the hoardings
      of 12 o'clock<br/>The phallus of Rimbaud came to rule<br/>Graffiti of the Kingless
      Town.<br/><br/>and<br/>The clothes-horse of fatigue gouges my scalp.<br/><br/>(I
      think they will go into a poem about<br/>Journeys and Cities - something of
      that<br/>kind.)<br/><br/>Science & Industry at Barnstead tonight.
