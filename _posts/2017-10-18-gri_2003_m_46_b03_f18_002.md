      I was very tempted to have a photograph too - it would be useful for your present lectures -

      -stone bridge (dark)
      - bronze statuette
      -Vista of river with [unclear][/unclear]
      - pile of books with leaves red and gold
      -blue green coat
      -young artist drawing

      The vista is that lovely cool blue which appears in the Vauxhall pictures.
      I like the stotards - particularly the Shuee illustrating the AE vid - I did not much like the venues nnoise from the sea - the colour was rather garish - pinks and reds.  uiee quality of paint though.  the A. Kaufman was not interesting.  The Wilson and Mortimer was charming - though it didn't look much like Wilson - however I did not examine it very carefully.
      Michael has pointed out to me that Seaton Casew is near Van-burgh's most Basoiee work
