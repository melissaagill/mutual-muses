    annotation_text: 2.  I hope to finish my review today or tomorrow - It is a most
      tiresomely written book - like an over-written guide book which "jollys" one
      along all the time.  I had to go into Hastings again today, yesterday I did
      foot-paths with Tiny morning & afternoon - I am hoping to settle down to some
      painting during the weekend.  Please could you get my Library [unclear][/unclear]
      back to me as soon as possible as Michael is coming to London Tuesday morning
      early and needs them to get some books for his lecture.  I will send the Holland
      back to you during the weekend.  I love your drawing of Dandino and Oswald  Thank
      you for it.  Shall I send the Elak book straight to them or to you?
