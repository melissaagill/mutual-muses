      3.
      out in a little while.
      Philip Poises has invited me to a party
      on Saturday and, although I think you
      think I slip into urban excesses when you
      are away, I shall reject this invitat-
      ion to a gay, heady, whirling nught - of
      it with Charley and Philip and Peggy anx
      I tremble to think who else.
      D. Tintoretto sends you his love and
      Lionel tells me that it was Willy Gil-
      son at the Tate Gallery for he met him
      there himself. Lionel is profoundly
      shocked at my replacement in the Mun-
      ich pictures and he even considers letters
      to the National Press about it. D.
      Tintoretto even offered to beat Mr.
      Smythe up for me but this I reluctantly
      forbad him. He grumbled a bit and
      agreed  with bad grace.
      Today  I will ring Antal, Beckett,
      and Time and Tide - if I  have enough
      pennies. I shall  try and see the first
      two this week - before you come.
      Oh how I long for you to be here. I want
