      appeal to her. She would rake an original art critic, I must say,
      comparing you with Stanley Spencer.

      I have just finished Gide's Les Faux-Monrayeurs. Have you read it?
      It is an astonishing delicate non-commital novel: rather long and
      full of perverse adolescent boys. I am baffled and enchanted by it.

      Reverting to Muriel: you won't want to hear all my lectures at the
      Tate. I should imagine, so if you went on one of those days we could
      economise fairs and meet in town after your visit. How long will
      you stay, my darling.  As long as possible, please, please, please.

      My poem is developing but is still in pieces.  Here are a few pieces:

      The larsitude of slowest mornings
      When thought aims to Westermise the sun,
      Incorrigible fountain, savage
      leaping hurried lands like stairs, there at a time.

      Like alarms & ardours of a youth
      Slower to challenge than the glove he owns:
      On a bride with ceremony weighed
      Nostalgically tendering the veils to Rangers.

      At night journeys uncoil like snakes
      which it is a temptation to tread on.
      Sleeping women are the flowers
      Put out by the tendril night.

      and like hanging baroque works in museums
      where workmen of awake put autumn stiffs.

      I love you so much: not as much as but more than ever.  Oh my
      love, my muse, my heart.  I love you, I love you

      appeal to her. She would make an original art critic, I must say, comparing you with Stanley Spencer.
      I have just finished Gide's Les Faux-Monrayeurs. Have you read it? It is an astonishing delicate, non-commital novel: ratherer long and full of perverse adolescent boys. I am baffled and enchanted by it.
      Reverting to Muriel: you won't want to hear all my lectures at the Tate, I should imagine, so if you want one of those days we could economise fairs [fares] and meet in town after your visit. How long will you stay, my darling. As long as possible, please, please, please.
      My poem is developing but is still in pieces. Here are a few pieces:

      The lassitude of slowest mornings
      When thought aimsto Westernise the sun,
      Incorrigible fountain, savage
      leaping hurried lands, like stairs, three at a time.

      Like alarms & ardours of a youth,
      Slower to challenge than the glare he owns:
      On a hide with ceremony weighs
      Nostalgically tendering the nails to hangers.

      At night journeys uncoil like snakes
      which it is a temptation  to tread on.
      Sleeping women and the flowers
      Put out by the tendril night.

      and

      like hanging baroque works in museums
      where workman of awake put autumn stiffs.

      I love you so much: not as much as but more than an ever. Oh my only love, my muse, my hear. I love you, I love you
