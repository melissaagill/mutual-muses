      25-2-51  Pett  Dearest Lawrence,
      Dear one, how I think of
      your golden head and sapphire eyes
      my beautiful lion.  I hope your lect-
      ure was a success - from the end
      of your letter I guess it was a
      triumph!  I'm glad Paul was
      there to enjoy it - Thank him for
      his message and send him my
      love - say how I [unclear]"swanke"[/unclear] to all
      my friend that my work it ad-
      mired by an abstract painter!
      I am glad there were some compen-
      sations for the day with Charles,
      and that you found an intersting
      companion - I had always realized
      that Baeon was anal-sadistic
      but not that it contained castration
      fears - I didn't think it had
      reached the genital stage!
      I shall work on "The Flight"
      and "the Savage" tomorrow -
