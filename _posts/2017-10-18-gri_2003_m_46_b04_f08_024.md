      [24-8-51]  Blackheath  Monday  Dearest Sylvia,
      Thank you for your letter which persuade me that I
      should, after all, accept and of the jobs, if I get a
      chance.  One source of misgiving to me was how you
      would feel living in Leeds or Birminham but I see you
      would prefer it to a precarious existance here - and I
      am sure you are right.  I love you and do wish to live
      with you all the time.  When I read your letters the
      sun was very bright and I wrote the following poem:  do
      read this one as it should express my allegiance to
      'reality' better than its spce in prose could:

      Sunlight ricochetting silently
      Off objects, wounds the darkness
      Willing to snooze in rooms, in heads:

      WIndows star at the volleys,
      Walls are changed; burly shadows
      Fall from hills and die in valleys.

      Phoebus shoots - not arrows now -
      But Dawn's a comely Westerner.

      I see myself as a Mallarme in Leeds or Birmingham, correct

      externally, and inwardly outrageous and dedicated to you,

      my Muse.

      I will write again soon but I do not feel like writing
      more at the moment.

      Paul sent his love.

      I love you,
      Lawrence
