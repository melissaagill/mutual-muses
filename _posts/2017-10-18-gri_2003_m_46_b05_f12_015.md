      remodelling of places one knows. A walk along a street
      is chancy and unfamiliar. Cars are useless & edge along
      slower than pedestrians. In the evening beams of light
      have a weird tangibility. The upset conditions produce
      an air-raid kind of intimacy with people who who grin at
      you, roll their eyes heavenward, and so on. As I am
      not going any farther than the post tomorrow it does not
      worry me now I am home but I hope it clears by Mon-
      day. (The TG almost deserted: a dozen came to the
      lecture.)
      In early January there will be a Matisse exhibition
      at the TG so that will mean a fresh subject to lecture on,
      in addition to the pleasure of seeing his work (possibly
      including sculpture, I believe). Later in January there will prob-
      ably be another exhibition in the Tate. This is not fixed
      yet but is very probable. It is the large Mexican exh-
      ibition from Paris. It will take up the entire sculpture
      hall and 4 or 5 galleries as well. I have agreed to
      lecture on it tho' at present I know nothing about Mex-
      ican art.
      The Dutch exh. is wretchedly hung but contains fas-
      cinating groups of paintings of Rembrandt, Hals, van
      Goyen, Cuyp, Terbrugghen, Steen. No Branwen unfor-
      tunately. I think you will enjoy it.
      I went to the National Film Theatre last night and
      saw Griffith's True Heart Susie. In a way I was enchanted
      but in another way furious. You might be interested in
      the fragment of an article I enclose about it.

      remodelling of places one knows. A walk along a street is chancy and unfamiliar. Cars are useless & edge along slower than pedestrians. In the evening beams of light have a wierd tangibility. The upset conditions produce an air-raid kind of intimacy with people who grin at you, roll their eyes heavenward, and so on. As I am not going any farther than the post tomorrow it does not worry me now I am home but I hope it clears by Monday. (The TG almost deserted: a dozen came to the lecture.)

      In early January there will be a Matisse exhibition at the TG so that will mean a fresh subject to lecture on, in addition to the pleasure of seeing his work (possibly including sculpture, I believe). Later in January there will probably be another exhibition in the Tate. This is not fixed yet but is very probable. It is the large Mexican exhibition from Paris. It will take up the entire sculpture hall and 4 or 5 galleries as well. I have agreed to lecture on it tho' at present I now nothing about Mexican art.

      The Dutch exh. is wretchedly hung but contains fascinating groups of paintings & Rembrandt, Hals, Van Goyen, Cuyn, Terbruggen, Steen. No Bronmer unfortunately. I think you will enjoy it.

      I went to the National Film Theatre last night and saw Griffith's True Heart Service. In a way I was enchanted but in another way furious. You might be interested in the fragment of an article I enclose about it.
