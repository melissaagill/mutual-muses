      Dear Lawrence
      I hope that you "got off" comfortably this morning. I should think you should have a pleasant crossing the day is fine and calm. I got up early this morning to make lunch - or pastry for it so that if it is fine enough I can paint by the church. Yesterday afternoon I went to the Savages and made a fairly good start on Frankie, they are most helpful and interested and I think, I got on well with the child so that I have no doubt that it will succeed at the second attempt if not at the first. After tea I sketched in my "Flight" which is quite promising.

      Thank you so much for your letter, and for sending the tea

      I got up early this morning to make lunch - or pastry for it so that if it is fine enough I can paint by the Church. Yesterday afternoon I went to the Savages and made a fairly good start on Frankie. They are most helpful and interested,  and I think, I got on well with the child  so that I have no doubt that it will succeed at the second attempt if not at the first. After tea I sketched in my [unclear]"Flight"[/unclear] which is quite promising.
      Thank you so much for your letter, and for sending the tea
