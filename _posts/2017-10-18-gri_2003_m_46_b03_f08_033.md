      Tuesday           [12-9-50]
      Dearest Sylvia-
      I am writing-as you can tell, I am sure, from the pen in a post office. I have had lunch with Charles which was terribly boring: if you think I was slack in a fortnight in Paris you should hear what Charles did not do in his 9 days! I shall not waste space on him further.
      I was charmed to notice in Brighton the large number of very dignified cats-most of them employing the Regency setting better than their owners. Really, I have never seen so many fine cats at once. I enjoyed the Pavilion furnishings very much, though the arrangement is by no means comprehensive or ideal. One charming clock has a shepherd (Narcisus?) leaning on a [unclear][/unclear][unclear] holding the dial, below which is a lion's head spouting a glass spiral which rotates, & appears like water. There is a mirror base.
      I expect Ting has sat for you by now-I hope so. Tomorrow I am devoting to lectures which I must get ready & the end of the week I shall devote to finishing the Hogarth chapter. I am thinking of analyzing a cowboy film in terms of the [unclear][/unclear] legend. John McHale & I are going to the pictures this evening-probably to another Western as Orflee is off. I shall have written some of it when you come, I hope. I have posted all my child art review. I enclose a new poem for you-about you.
      I'm glad you enjoy Great Morning-as I did. The Redfern is being somewhat rebuilt at the moment & the pictures are still the 2nd installment.

                         [12-9-50]
      Tuesday
      Dearest Sylvia -
          I am writing - as you can tell, I am sure, from the [unclear]pen[/unclear]
      in a post office. I have had lunch with Charles which was
      terribly boring: if you think I was slack in  a fortnight in Paris
      you should hear what Charles did not do in his 9
      days! I shall not waste space on him further.
           I was charmed to notice in Brighton the large number of
      very dignified cats - most of them employing the Regency
      setting better than their owners. Really, I have never seen
      so many fine cats at once. I enjoyed the Pavilion [unclear]furnish[/unclear]-
      ings very much, though the arrangement is by no means com-
      prehensive or ideal. One charming clock has a shepherd (Narcissus?)
      leaning on a plinth holding the dial, below which is a lion's
      head spouting a glass spiral which rotates, & appears like
      water. There is a mirror base.
           I expect Tiny has sat for you by now - I hope so. Tomorrow
      I am devoting to lectures which I must get ready & the end
      of the week I shall devote to finishing the Hogarth chapter.
      I am thinking of analyzing a cowboy film in terms of the
      [unclear]graal[/unclear] legend. John McHale & I are going to the pictures
      this evening - probably to another Western as Orphee is off.
      I shall have written some of it when you come, I hope.
      I have posted off my Child Art review. I enclose a new
      poem for you - about you.
           I'm glad you enjoy Great [unclear]Morning[/unclear] - as I did.
      The Redfern is being somewhat rebuilt at the moment
      & the pictures are still the 2nd installment.
                         I love  you, my beauty,
                             I love you
