      Thank you for your letter and the brilliantly vivid action study of Dandy! I am having an epidiascope - which saves time in some ways! and is awful in others! I haven't finished my lecture yet but hope to to-day. I was working on it this morning and should have had at least an hour before lunch when poor Desiree fainted - I was called in to aid and spent the rest of the morning in a cheering and administering capacity! The poor child had a temperature and has a cold - she shouldn't really have come out at all, added to that I think she has been over-working.
