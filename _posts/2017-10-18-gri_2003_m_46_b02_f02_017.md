      Blackheath                    6 ii 1949
      Dearest Sylvia,
      What a lovely image-that of the cassone. It enchants and comforts me. You are a poet yourself-in such an image you show it, and in your landscape and sky descriptions, too.
      I am intrigued at your news of an idea for a large composition...
      Also about your colour scheme for Aberdeen House.
      Thanks you so much for the clothing coupons. I hope to be able to dazzle and please you when next we meet by leaning back in the train and crossing my legs.
      As well as my Banstead lecture I have got one in the morning at the N.G. to children. It is called "Looking at Pictures". A lot of new primitives are up so I shall talk about them. Also tomorrow I am meeting Helen Rosenau at the B?M. She wants me to vet a letter she is writing to the Burlington in reply to an attack Douglas Cooper has made on her appropos David.
      Today I am working on Hogarth-accurately rather than happily. I have just had a
