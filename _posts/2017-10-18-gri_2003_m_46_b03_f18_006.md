      [unclear]almost by Thurs Use - [/unclear] and sorry that Redcar was so dreary - though that was not unexpected! I am most excited to hear your new poem - and I love the animals postscript. Have you finished the Ciree - Orpheus poem now?
      I don't know if I can finish my cabbages - I shall try tomorrow. We went to the sale yesterday - we did not buy anything, but I was glad to see the things again - I don't think the Wrights really are - perhaps they are Lates! I will bring the photos.
      I have still got rather a cold - or else acute catarrh.
      I love you dearest one - and shall see you so soon after this - I hope you will have had a pleasant week-end.
      I love you
      Sylvia
