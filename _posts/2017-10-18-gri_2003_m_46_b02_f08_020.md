      Blackheath  13 ix 1949
      Dearest Sylvia,
      Your letter did not come first post and I have only now, in the afternoon, received it.
      I am so distressed to year that you are suffering from insomnia.  My poor dear creature, I fear that your sleepless periods are worrying as well as tiring.
      Your lion has a bed in which he hopes you might be able to sleep better and would love you to sleep there on Saturday.  (Saturday is better for me than Thursday because I have appointments both Thursday and Friday and I have kept the week-end free in case you came.)  My first impulse was to see you at the earliest possible moment, of course, but Saturday is the actual day in any case.
      However, if you are still in a very nervous state would you prefer not to travel?  I long to see you, again, but if you think the journey would disturb you in your present state I will wait until the following Thursday to see you.
      I hope, my wonderful love, that your health permits you to ravel but if it should not I will understand.  The health giving properties of lions is well-known and, perhaps Dandy could be prevailed upon to lecture for hours about Hogarth so that you would fall fast asleep.  Seriously, my love, allow your health to decide - that is most important.
      My poor love, be well soon.  I shall think of you every night as I have been doing and hope that you will rest.  I love you, I love you,
      Lawrence

      Blackheath  13 ix 1949

      Dearest Sylvia,

        Your letter did not come first post and I have only now, in the afternoon, received it.

        I am so distressed to hear that you are suffering from insomnia.  My poor dear creature, I fear that your sleepless periods are worrying as well as tiring.

        Your lion has a bed in which he hopes you might be able to sleep better and would love you to sleep there on Saturday.  (Saturday is better for me than Thursday because I have appointments both Thursday and Friday and I have kept the week-end free in case you came.)  My first impulse was to see you at the earliest possible moment, of course, but Saturday is the actual day in any case.

        However, if you are still in a very nervous state would you prefer not to travel?  I long to see you, again, but if you think the journey would disturb you in your present state I will wait until the following Thursday to see you.

        I hope, my wonderful love, that your health permits you to travel but if it should not I will understand.  The health giving properties of lions is well-known and, perhaps, Dandy could be prevailed upon to lecture for hours about Hogarth so that you would fall fast asleep.  Seriously, my love, allow your health to decide - that is most important.

        My poor love, be well soon.  I shall think of you every night as I have been doing and hope that you will rest.  I love you, [unclear] commence [/unclear] I love you.
