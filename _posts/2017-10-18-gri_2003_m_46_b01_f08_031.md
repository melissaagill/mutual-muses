      Dearest Sylvia
      I was overwhelmed by my owl reception. Garlands of roses as you promised and also an owl orchestra playing a Benjamin Britten anthem. This morning I went to see Bedfords Towers (up beyond Landsdowne) and my white and tawny companions were enchanted at it. I could hardly drag them away; they kept swooping round it and disappearing inside. We were four - Diedre 13 years old as I told you - was with me and we were lucky enough to find some mushrooms. Now again I was grateful to the supernatural powers you have granted your owls for they flew ahead spotting for us although it was broad day.
      From where I write I can see the [unclear]sham[/unclear] Castle on the hill. The Tawny Owl has snatched the opportunity - we've just had Sunday dins - [unclear]to[/unclear] have a lie down on the bed and the white one is reading a Bath Guide with great interest because he had not realized - he is only young - that Minerva had so much to [unclear]die[/unclear] with Bath from the earliest days. The Tawny one intends to take the waters while he is here - he had a twinge in the left wing last evening and a Beau Owl, who met us at the station, told him he could soon be cured at the Baths.
      Picking mushrooms reminded me very fiercely of a week ago at Pett. I cannot believe it is so little time since we met. [On the 30th by the way, Convent Garden Opera are doing The Magic Flute. But you will tell me I trust what you want to see]. How pleasantly In anticipate seeing you again and I hope, more than seeing. How well do you know Bath? Do tell me the parts you like best. I wish that I could write at greater length, and more tenderly but I am a bit harried because it is time for me to go out to tea. I have snatched time to write this.

      Baltimit
      Bath
      Somerset

      19 IX 1948
      Dearest Sylvia,
      I was overwehlmed by my own reception. Garlands of roses as you promised and also an owl orchestra playing a Benjamin Britten anthem. This morning I went to see Bedeford's Towes (up beyond Lordsdowne) and my white and Tawny companions were en-chanted at it. I would fondly drag them away : they kept swoop-ing round it and disappearing inside. We were four - Dierdre 13 years older I told you - was with me and we were lucky en-ough to find some mushrooms. How again I was grateful for the supernatural powers you have granted your owls for they flew ahead spotting for us although it was broad day.

      From where I write I can see Shan Castle on the hill. The Tawny owl has snatched the opportunity - we've just had Sunday dins - have a lie down on the bed and the white One is reading a Bath Guide with great interest because he had not realised - he is only young - that minerva had so much to die with Bath from the earliest days. The Tawny one intends to take the waters while he is here - he had a twinge in the left wing last evening and a Beau Owl, who met us at the station told him he could soon be cured at the Baths.

      Picking mushrooms reminded very [unclear][/unclear] of a week ago at Pett. I cannot beliee it is so little time since we met. [on the 30CS by the way Covent Garden Opera are doing The Magic Flute. But you will tell me I trust what you want to see.] How plea-sureably I anticipate seeing you again and I hope, more than seeing you. How well do you know Bath? Do tell me the parts you like best. I wish that I could write at greater length and more [unclear][/unclear] but I am a bit worried because it is time for me to go out to tea. I have snatched the time to write this. But I wanted just to assure you of my great love for you, dearest minerva. I send you all my love

      Laurence
