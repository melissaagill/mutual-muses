      2. It is quite a pleasant day - I shall work in the garden this afternoon digging trenches for the peas and manuring them. I have nearly finished my small still-life I have only to finish off the table.
      I hope "Athene" goes well. The I.C.A sounds very boring and trite!
      I have no news, of course - Lent is in "full swing" now with 2 extra services a week. Clifford is extremely tired which makes him very critical and rather infalliable! Tiny is more cheerful. I am glad I shall be able to hear his lecture on the 10th.
      To-morrow the Savages are taking me to the pictures to see "Streetcar Named Desire"! I am having them to a cold supper after.

      hope "Athene" goes well. The I.C.A.<br/>sounds very boring and trite!<br/>I
      have no news of course -<br/>Lent is in "full swing" now with 2<br/>extra services
      a week. Clifford is<br/>extremly tired which makes him very<br/>critical and
      rather infallable! Tiny<br/>is more cheerful. I am glad I<br/>shall be able
      to hear his lecture on<br/>the 10th.<br/>To-morrow, the Savages are taking us<br/>to
      the pictures to see "Streetcar<br/>Named Desire"! I am having them<br/>to a
      cold supper after.<br/>
