      Pett
      Dearest Lawrence,
      Although I am better I am still
      in bed as I still feel rather mouldy
      and cannot get rid of the tightness
      in my chest so I shall not come to
      town on Thursday.  I think it would
      be foolish to travel in this cold weather
      and I don't suppose I shall be
      quite well then; and as my being
      in bed has made me a "bit behind"
      with my framing I shall not come
      to town until the 19th when I
      come up in the car. I shall ask
      Mrs. Salter to come up
      a little earlier than agreed and
      if he can maange it go on to
      Cambridge.  Then I will return to
      London and stay some days with'
      you if you would like that.  If M.
      cannot see me in Cambridge I will
      stay and try to meet him in town.
      P.S. I shall try to fetch at leas some of the
      pictures at B'heath.

      Pett         3.2 53

      Dearest Lawrence,

         Although I am better I am still in bed as I still feel rather mouldy and cannot get rid of the tightness in my chest so I shall not come to town on Thursday - I think it would be foolish to travel in this cold weather and I don't suppose I shall be quite well then; and as my being in bed has made me a "bit behind"  with my framing I shall not come to town until the 19th when I come up in the car. I shall ask [unclear]Mme[/unclear] Salten to come up a little [unclear]earlier[/unclear] than arranged and if he can manage it go on to Cambridge. Then I will return to London and stay some days with you if you would like that. If M. cannot see me in Cambridge I will stay and try to meet him in town.

      P.S I shall try to fetch at least some of the pictures at B'heath.
