      I can't see myself painting
      out of doors until this
      cold spell is over - There has
      been an east wind for about
      3 days. But I am getting
      an with the dressing - table
      painting which is going well.
      I have finished the landscape
      on the [unclear][/unclear] and am working
      on my reflection in the mirrow,
      which I hope I shall finish
      to-day.
      I hope your lecture went
      well yesterday. You seem to
      have a free week as far as
      the Tate is concerned next week.
      I'm glad you are working on
      your film book again. The film
      "Talk about a Stranger" sounds
      very interesting. I should love
      to see it with you - and I
      hope very much to see "[unclear][/unclear]"

      Dearest Lawrence

      I can't see myself painting
      out of doors until this
      cold spell is over - there has
      been an east wind for about
      3 days. But I am getting
      on with the dressing-table
      painting which is going well.
      I have finished the landscape
      on the right and am working
      on my reflection in the mirror
      which I hope I shall finish
      today.

      I hope your lecture went
      well yesterday. You seem to
      have a free week as far as
      the Tate is concerned next week.

      I'm glad you are working on
      your film book again. The film
      "Talk about a Stranger" sounds
      very interesting; I whould love
      to see it with you - and I
      hope very much to see "[unclear][/unclear]"
