      25 Nov. Blackheath Dearest Sylvia
      I have had a letter from Dannatt. He is going to Clepstow Road today - Wednesday. He promises the report for
      the end of the week. I am so anxious to hear. I
      feel excited inside - a small physical twitch in the
      solar plexus - when I think about it.

      Your marvellous scarf keeps me warm. It was ad-
      mired at the ICA last night incidentally. Magda
      & the others did not come for some reason but I
      had a very pleasand time - mainly with Peter Wat-
      son & David Sylvester. I met Stephen Spender who is
      nicer than you think - at least, nicer than I expected.
      The Symporium is definetely going to appear in En-
      counter, by the way. Victor's piece was excellent.
      Bell, Williamson, Coldstream: very boring.

      By the way: I suggested the 3rd as the day on which
      we ought to catch Rulemamn's lecture on Giorgione.
      But I think we ought to make it the 10th. I hate
      to delay being with you but when I said 3 rather
      than 10th I was being over-optimistic. Let me
      tell you my schedule next week.

      25 NOV.

      Dearest Sylvia
      I have had a letter from [unclear]Dammatt[/unclear]. He is going to Clapstow
      Road today - Wednesday. He promises the report for
      the end of the week. I am so anxious to hear. I
      feel excited inside - a small physical twitch in the
      solar plexus - when I think about it.

      Your marvelous scarf keeps me warm. It was ad-
      mired at the iCA last night incidentally. Magda
      & the others did not come for some reason but I
      had a very pleasant time - mainly with Peter Wat-
      son and David Sylvester. I met Stephen Spender who is
      nicer than you think - at least, nicer than I expected.
      The symposium is definitely going to appear in En-
      counter, by the way. Victor's piece was excellent.
      Bell, Williamson, Coldstream: very boring.

      By the way: I suggested the 3rd as the day on which
      we ought to catch Ruhlmann's lecture on Giorgione.
      But I think we ought to make it the 10th. I hate
      to delay being with you but when I said 3 rather
      than 10th I was being over-optimistic. Let me

      25 NOV.

      Dearest Sylvia

      I have had a letter from [unclear]Dammott[/unclear]. He is going to Chepstow Road today - Wednesday. He promises to report for the end of the week. I am so anxious to hear. I feel excited inside - a small physical twitch in the solar plexus - when I think about it.

      Your marvellous scarf keeps me warm. It was admired at the ICA last night incidentally. Magda & the others did not come for some reason but I had a very pleasant time - mainly with Peter Watson & David Sylvester. I met Stephen Spender who is nicer than you think -  at least, nicer than I expected. The symposium is definitely going to appear in Encounter, by the way. Victor's piece was excellent. Bell, Williamson, Coldstream, very boring.

      By the way: I suggested the 3rd as the day on which we ought to catch [unclear]Rulewamn's[/unclear] lecture on Giorgione. But I think we ought to make it the 10th. I hate to delay being with you but when I said 3 rather than 10th I was being over-optimistic. Let me tell you my schedule next week.
