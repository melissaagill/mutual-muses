      [5-4-53] Blackheath Easter Sunday

      Dearest Sylvia  Thank you for your letters.  Oh. weat on Easter card!  Strictly for Minotaur!  I am glad to hear the model is so accomodating.  Pleased, too, that you & Tiny seem to be getting on well - with a small conspiracy to keep C from realising he is not too - well.  However, he cannot be very bad if he is writing ( I know how little he enjoys doing that):  it sounds a very inter-esting subject indeed.  Don't worry about the Unknown Palit. Pris.  Ballet.  It won't make any difference to A Prizes A - anyway - by yesterday only 47 people had rated - such is the ox-like, bone head lethargy of the Eng. art-love, art-hater.  Of course, stay with me as long as you can till aunt Do is ready to visit you.  (Be warned I have to go and see one or two of the sculptors to interview them for my article but that will only take a little time.) "Dig That" means "do you get that?", "surprise".  It is rare for   [unclear]Ethell[/unclear] to give things away you see.  I lent Paul H. Neurotica.  He showed it to Kenneth Huma, who he lives with, & KH showed it to Hermione Ainglat who adored it.  She has even adapted a sentence from it as a new tag-line p that is to say, catch-phrase. "Well, that's enough for one evening - eh?"

      I know you think I do too many things and diffuse my creative energy but it is possible this flexibility may pay off soon.  I expect to write - "on spec" it is time, with Frank Cordell & Slon Carter - a ballet for TV.  Also Paul, & I are considering writing the treatment of a film.  He is in the business now and that is a help.  He might be able to sell it if we can create something suitable.  (Also - no money in this - Frank Cordell is interested in one of my ideas for an avant-garde movie which he might make - the late summer.)  The only time I am going out today is to post this letter.  Otherwise I am staying in to write.  Love you Lawrence xxxxx

      Blackheath                  [5-4-53]
      Easter Sunday

      Dearest Sylvia

         Thank you for your letters. Oh, what an Easter card! Strictly for Minotaur!
         I am glad to hear the model is so accommodating. Pleased, too, that you & Tiny seem to be getting on well - with a small conspiracy to keep C from realising he is not too-well. However, he cannot be very bad if he is writing (I know how little he enjoys doing that): it sounds a very inter-esting subject indeed.

         Don't worry about the Unknown Polit. Pris. ballot. It won't make any difference to the prizes & - anyway - by yesterday only 47 people had voted - such is the ox-like, bone head lethargy of the Eng. art-lover, art-hater.

         Of course, stay with me as long as you can till aunt Do is ready to visit you. (Be warned I have to go and see one or two of the sculptors to interview them for my article but that will only take a little time.)

         'Dig that' means 'do you get that?', 'surprise'. It is rare for Ithell to give things away you see.

         I lent Paul H. Neurotica. He showed it to Kenneth Hume, who he lives with, & KH showed it to Hermine Gingold who adored it. She has even adapted a sentence from it as a new tag-line - that is to say, catch-phrase. 'Well, that's enough for one evening - eh?'

         I know you think I do too many things and diffuse my creative energy but it is possible this flexibility may pay off soon. I expect to write - 'on spec' it is time, with Frank Cordell & Alan Carter - a ballet for TV. Also Paul H & I are considering writing the treatment of a film. He is in the business now and that is a help. He might be able to sell it if we can create something suitable. (Also - no money in this - Frank Cordell is interested in one of my ideas for an avant garde movie which he might make in the late summer.)

         The only time I am going out today is to post this letter. Otherwise I am staying in to write.
                              love you
