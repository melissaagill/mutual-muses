      nearly finished the double portrait in the rose garden.\nDo come on the 7th.
      Of course I want you to come then. I will meet you where and when you say. Why
      not come by train?\nHow nice you should have suggested the Holmes quotation
      for Key To The City. In fact it is already quoted: one seems to  be following
      the same train of thought. Your letter implies that you think I am not working.
      Yesterday morning I wrote 750 words to finish Key To The City: then I saw Ace
      In The Hole at Lewisham; back home at 4 I wrote and completed The Tragic Bluff
      (1250 words) about that film. And I wrote an additional 250 words for Shadow
      on Sunset Boulevard.  I started writing before 10; I finished over 12 hours
      later.\nThough I have to see Donald Parsons today I hope to finish V. Dent by
      the weekend to do another film article. And get Van Dyck ready for the 12th.
      I'm glad you'll be in town for that lecture, my darling, \nI have lots of ideas
      for plays at the moment; our Venetian one; a libretto, half-way between Offenbach
      and Andre Breton - half masque, half automatic poem. We must discuss them when
      you come to Blackheath.\nI love you\nLawrence"

      How nice you shoul have suggested the Holmes quotation for Key
      To The City. In fact it is already quoted: we seem to be follow-
      ing the same train of thought. Your letter implies that you think I
      am not working. Yesterday morning I wrote 750 words to finish
      Key To The City: then I saw Ace In The Hole at Lewishan; back home at
      4. I wrote and completed The Tragic Bluff (1250 words) about that film. And I wrote an additional 250 words for Shadow On
      Sunset Boulevard. I stated writing before 10; I finished over
      12 hours later.
      Though I have to see Donald Parrons today, I hope to finish V. Dent by
      the weekend & do another film article. And get Van Dyck ready
      for the 12th. I'm glad you'll be in town for that lecture, my darling,

      I have lots of ideas for plays on the moment: our Venetion one;
      a [unclear][/unclear], half-way between Affenbach and Andre Breton - half
      marque, half automobic poem. We must discuss them when you
      come to Blackheath.
