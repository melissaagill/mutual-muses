      My dearest Lawrence
      I am so happy to have your letter.
      I regret to say I am still in bed with
      a god-awful cold. It was on my
      chest yesterday but luckily with a
      lalere and leprechaun wive it is
      much better.  I shall try very hard
      to get well as I do want to come
      up to town.  Tiny thinks I ought
      not but I will see.  I feel rather
      imprisoned here, and Tiiny, consciously
      or "unes"ly worries on all my fears.
      Will you really write to Cardiff, do
      you still steal, your "bad" social
      attitude, they gave me quite an
      lecture on it which I got back
      and Tiny is become quite "un American"
      again!  They really think of course
      that I should give you both up
      and settle down here with my work
      but I feel that my situation
