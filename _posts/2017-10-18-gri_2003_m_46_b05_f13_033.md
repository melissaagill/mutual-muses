      2    in Art News.  So I hope she
      may "make one"!
      We shall probably catch the
      2.10 to Charing Cross arriving
      3.58.  I think Tiny is coming
      too.  Then I thought I could
      leave my case at the station
      and take my picture to
      Mr. Bergman--(with you I hope) have a cup
      of tea there--leave a
      hold all at the flat and
      then to Clifford's lecture.  Then
      we shall sup together--won't
      it be fun--they are so much
      looking forward to seeing you.
      You make them gay!
      I adore you, my sweetheart
      take care of yourself in this
      cold weather.  I'm so sorry
      it was so chilly at S.O.
      I love you
      Sylvia
      P.S. Thank you so much for the packing. S.
