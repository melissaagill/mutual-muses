      Dearest Lawrence
      Thank you so much for your letter and the delightful poems.  I am very happy to hear of your financial improvement - What are your plans?  When would you like me to come? I think I cannot come before Thursday - so you are lecturing on Wednesday- and also also there would be a bit of a rush - on the other hand I am in the middle of a picture and do not know if I shall finish it in time --as m,. is reclining on a [unclear]Kdlin ref[/unclear] which is for the flat.  Would you like to come here for a day or two if you have time - or for the weekend--the woods would love to see you?  Then you could see my big painting?  What do you think?  On the other hand I would like to see the Kensington Gallery.

      Dearest Lawrence
      Thank you so much for your letter
      and the delightful poems. I am
      very happy to hear of your financial
      improvement -  What are your plans?
      When would you like me to come?
      I think I cannot come before Thurs-
      day - as you are lecturing on Wed-
      nesday - and also [unclear]that[/unclear] would be
      a bit of a rush - on the other
      hand I am in the middle of
      a picture and do not know if
      I shall finish it in time - as
      M. is reclining on a [unclear]kitchen ref[/unclear]
      which is for the flat. Would you
      like to come here for a day or two
      if you have time - or for the week-
      end - the Woods would love
      to see you ? Then you could see
      my big painting? What do you think?
      On the other hand I would like
      too see the Kensington Gallery.

    clean_transcription: Pett 26 . 11 . 50<br/>Dearest Lawrence<br/>Thank you so much
      for your letter<br/>and the delightful poems. I am<br/>very happy to hear of
      your financial<br/>improvement -  What are your plans?<br/>When would you like
      me to come?<br/>I think I cannot come before Thurs-<br/>day - as you are lecturing
      on Wed-<br/>nesday - and also that would be<br/>a bit of a rush - on the other<br/>hand
      I am in the middle of<br/>a picture and do not know if<br/>I shall finish it
      in time - as<br/>M. is reclining on a kitchen ref<br/>which is for the flat.
      Would you<br/>like to come here for a day or two<br/>if you have time - or for
      the week-<br/>end - the Woods would love<br/>to see you ? Then you could see<br/>my
      big painting? What do you think?<br/>On the other hand I would like<br/>too
      see the Kensington Gallery.

      Dearest Lawrence
           Thank you so much for your letter and the delightful poems.  I am very happy to hear of your financial improvement.  What are your plans?  When would you like me to come?  I think I cannot come before Thursday - as you are lecturing on Wednesday - and also that would be a bit of a rush - on the other hand I am in the middle of a picture and do not know if I shall finish it in time - as M. is reclining on a [unclear] Kelin [/unclear] rug which is for the flat.  Would you like to come here for a day or two if you have time - or for the weekend -  the woods would love to see you?  Then you could see my big painting?  What do you think?  On the other hand I would like to see the Kensington Gallery.
