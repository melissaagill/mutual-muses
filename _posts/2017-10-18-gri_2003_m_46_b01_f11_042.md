      11 Mansel Road,
      Wimbledon.
      18th December.
      Dearest Sylvia,
      I love you. When I think of you
      suddenly my heart gives a distinct
      little beat, an extra jump.
      When you come in January consider
      the bridges back as little as possible,
      dearest. Try to reduce the
      conflict when you come. You must trust
      my love as I trust yours. You ought
      not to hope for a compromise. Although
      it will be difficult at first I will
      make you content.
      I do not believe Clifford when he
      says obstacles have helped our love.
      The fact our love has survived when
      there have been so many things to suppress
      or weaken it, is proof of the integrity
      of our love.
      How happy I was in Camber Castle—
      I admired your reconstruction (between
      kisses) of the plan. What a lovely
      landscape was there—flat, roomy, the
      light changing. I have not yet finished
      my poem about it but I have got
      a sonnet ready in time for this letter:
