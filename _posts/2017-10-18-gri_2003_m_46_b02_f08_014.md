      Lullaby for Sylvia

      Sleep, my darling, in the shadowed nest,
      Lulled not disturbed by sounds of waves,
      Lazy and hypnotic rollers
      Sounding in the ear's soft cove.
      The vigilant and nervous stars
      Die  on the passage of a cloud
      Or the closure of an eyelid:
      Retract allegiance to the day -
      Remember Phoebus' warmth, not light.

      Owls glide upon the clouds
      Like sleepy nymphs on the low tide:
      Neptune's trident slowly falls
      To a languorous horizontal.
      Words on signposts fade away
      With the restless commerce of the day.
      Detumescent sundials lounge
      In the garden like stone beaux.

      As you forget the daylit claims
      Of action, order, and discretion,
      Let the blood's firm rhythm
      Conduct imagination
      To vague allusive pastorals
      Where the willows swish like skirts
      Over softly passing boats
      And slow motion festivals
      Lull your sense with monochrome:
      Penny theatres of the ballet
      Dancing on your oblivious comb.

      Night is the complement of day,
      Its languorous and yielding double.
      Be not its enemy with thoughts
      Of day's restless crystal bubbles
      Disturbing coastal plains of water.
      Relax, my love, your worried hands.

      Lullabye for Sylvia

      Sleep, my darling, in the shadowed nest,
      Lulled not disturbed by sounds of waves,
      Lazy and hypnotic rollers
      Sounding in the ear's soft cove.
      The vigilant and nervous stars
      Die on the passage of an eyelid:
      Retract allegiances to the day -
      Remember Phoebus' warmth, not light.

      Owls glide upon the clouds
      Like sleepy nymphs on the low tide:
      Neptune's trident slowly falls
      To a languorous horizontal.
      Words on signposts fade away
      With the restless commerce of the day.
      Detumescent sundials lounge
      In the garden like stone beaux.

      As you forget the daylit claims
      Of action, order, and discretion,
      Let the blood's firm rhythm
      Conduct imagination
      To vague allusive pastorals
      Where the willows swish like skirts
      Over softly passing boats
      And slow motion festivals
      Lull your sense with monochrome:
      Penny theatres of the ballet
      Dancing on your oblivious comb.

      Night is the compliment of day,
      It's languorous and yielding double.
      Be not its enemy with thoughts
      Of day's restless crystal bubbles
      Disturbing coastal plains of water.
      Relax, my love, your worried hands.
      Remember for a moment me,
      A figurehead upon the ship,
