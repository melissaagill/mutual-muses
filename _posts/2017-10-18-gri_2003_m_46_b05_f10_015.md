      Several Gothic gates congest traffic but this only increases
      my pleasure in them. On the whole the town plan has a nice
      sense of enclosure and openess, happily mingled: you wriggle
      through one of the gates and an entirely new set of roads and
      houses appears. The river is almost lost in ricketty medieval
      houses and then opens into a great bay with Victorian warehouses,
      and so on.

      The castle is interesting - partly for a marvellous pano-
      rama from the top of the observation tower - and partly, to this
      decadent lion, for the Assize Court which is contained within
      the thick spacious walls. It is Regency Tudor (1826) by Sir
      Robert Smirke: absolute symmetry with Gothic windows, battle-
      ments, and flanking slender paired towers like classical pavil-
      ions. In front of the houses a light Tudor loggia.

      Lion must write some business letters now, alsa.

      Oh, Sylvia, I adore you. I lovy you
      Lawrence

      P.S.
      Dandy climbing the
      observation Tower
      in the castle.
