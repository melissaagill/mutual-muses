      Pett 23.2.52

      Dearest Lawrence,
      Thank you so much for your letter and the cheque - I hope you are not still so short - how long they take to pay! I was very happy to have Dandy lion's compliments.  I wonder if I could take out a subscription & "Lion News and Review" You must let me have more details!
      Let me say before I forget that in to-day's 'Times' I note that Hugh Sevulton has been appointed to the Walker Gallery Liverpool - so I wager [unclear][/unclear] will be free - we must look out for it - if only you "Hogarth" would come out soon it would help so much. Another thing that [unclear][/unclear] to me is that you might send Sir O. the Gilpin chapter and any other 18 papers you have

      you must let me have more details!
      Let me say before I forget that
      in today's "Times" I note that Hugh
      Scrutton has been appointed to the
      Walker Gallery LIverpool.  So I imagine
      Whitechapel will be free.  We must
      look out for it.  If only you
      "Hogarth" would come out soon it
      would help so much. Another thing
      that occurred to me is that you might
      send Sis O. the Gilpin chapter and
      any other 18th papers you have
