      Dearest Lawrence,
      Thank you for your letter - though it was more tantalizing than informative - as like the savage, you seemed to think it enough to have your activities to evoke them!  There was one piece of news which I forgot to tell you in my last letter - that a congregational minister (!) is to come to the Village Hall to talk of "Art and the Common Man" and Miss Shears asked me to chair it!  I rang her up, and declined the honour effusively(!)  As I am sure that I could not have forborne to insult the speaker in every capacity!
      So far I have not done much in the garden - I think I shall to-morrow though I might [unclear][/unclear] some seeds to-day.  So far I have only picked broccoli, inspected my beans coming up and transplanted some seedlings
