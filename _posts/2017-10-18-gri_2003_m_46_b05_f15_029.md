      Pett
      Dearest Lawrence,
      Saturday and Sunday seem the
      worst possible days to travel as I
      feared.  The only train on Sunday that
      is near a Pett bus is 4:48.  I
      could get out at London Bridge I think
      and you could, perhaps, be so kind as
      to meet me at Blackheath station;
      that would be about 7:00 or 8:00.  I could
      of course come by bus but it would
      not make much difference as it would
      have to be the 2:20.  On Saturday I
      could catch the 10.7 the 11.7 or
      the 2.07 which gets in at 3:58 or
      lthe 5.07 which gets in at 7:35.  Let
      me know what you think.
      I must now try to catch the
      post.

      Pelt 20.3.52

      Dearest Lawrence,
      Saturday and Sunday seem the
      worst possible days to travel as I
      feared. The only train on Sunday that
      is near a Pelt 'bus is 4.48 I
      could get out at London Bridge I think
      and you could, perhaps, be so kind as
      to meet me at Blackheath station;
      that would be about 7.0 or so. I could
      of course come by 'bus but it would
      not make much difference as it would
      have to be the 2.20. On Saturday I
      could cath the 10.7 the 11.7 or
      the 2.07 which gets in at 3 58 or
      the 5.07 which get in at 7.35. Let
      me know what you think.
      I must now try to catch the
      post.
      Sylvia
