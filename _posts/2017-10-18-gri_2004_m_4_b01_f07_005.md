      I am working on one or two other poems, also, which
      I hope to complete by the time you come, one of them based
      on the Feast of the Gods.

      One of the chairs, without a cover, is quite a nice
      green so I think we might keep it so.  The other one
      certainly needs a cover and the one Mrs Harreson is mak-
      ing is a not nice Chintz but there seems to be nothing I
      can do about it.

      I hope Giorgione is doing well.

      I have ordered your canvases.

      I love you,
      Lawrence

      I am working on one or two other poems, also, which I hope to complete by the time you come, one of them based on The Feast of the Gods.
      One of the chairs, without a cover, is quite a nice green so i think we might keep it so.  The other one certainly needs a cover and the one Mrs. Harreson is making is not nic Chintz but there seems to be nothing i can do about it.
      I hope Giorgione is doing well.
      I have ordered your canvases.
      I love you,
      Lawrence
      Dandy reading the Sunday Times
      P.S.
      Lionel says - is there not time for one more [unclear] Warsily [/unclear] picture...please...
