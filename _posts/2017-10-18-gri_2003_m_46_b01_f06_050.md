      Your advice, almost a warning, is entirely semi- [unclear]ble[/unclear]: I mean about the cake being thrown out of the window for want of a slice! May I slip in a diagram here: that is the cake and this is my slice.  Do not give my complaints more attention than is conventionally given to lovers' conventional complaints.  I say, quite seriously, that I am in excellent company.  Your love is so important to me that I shall certainly not imperil it is I can help it by excessive demands.  You know that. I [unclear]seamed thing[/unclear] that I am pretty good on the whole given the intensity of my love.  I am occasionally sad for you I am less frequently sad than ever before since before adolescence in [unclear]de[/unclear] blissful pre-sexual stages.  On no account be sad for what you have done for me.  Rather feel a glow because of your good [unclear]works[/unclear] inside the citadel of my ego.  A Russian philosopher - I don't know which one - likened sexual love to the destruction of the walls of a tower, or fort.  Non-Freudians statements of this nature are often suspect but this one is signification, don't you think?

      You are in Italy by now, following the footsteps of [unclear]Van Oyck (on Ruben's best varre)[/unclear] ,[unclear]Dures (until his fear of Venetian poison)[/unclear], Brueghel, Velasquez, and Thomas Patch. How fortunate you are, my dearest.

      Back in [unclear]Ris[/unclear] island I heard a Louis [unclear]Macheice[/unclear] version of Cinderella, sometimes [unclear]vulgar[/unclear], funny sometimes.  I was delighted [unclear]at[/unclear] the godmother. an [unclear]odd[/unclear] thing until a [unclear]Belise[/unclear] Square Central European accent who [unclear]eary[/unclear] "I fly through the air with the greatest of ease" when [unclear]Cronelly[/unclear] by broomstick.

      Your advice, almost a warning, is entirely semi-[ble]: I mean about the cake being thrown out of the window for want of a slice! May I slip in a diagram here: that is the cake and this is my slice. Do not give my complaints more attention than is conventionally given to lovers' conventional complaints.  I say, quite seriously, that I am in excellent company. [unclear] alone is so important to me that I shall certainly not imperil it if I can help it by excessive demands. You know that. I should think that I am pretty good on the whole given the intensity of my love. If I am occasionally sad for you I am less frequently sad than ever before since before adolescence in the blissful pre-sensual stages.  On no account be sad for what you have done for me. Rather feel a glow because of your good works inside the citadel of my ego. A Russian philosopher - I don't know which one - likened sexual love to the destruction of the walls of a tower, or port. Non-Freudian statements of this nature are often suspect but this one is significant, don't you think?
      [Ran] [unclear] in Italy by now, allowing the footsteps of Van Oyeke (on Rubens' best [unclear]), [unclear] (with his fear of Venetian poison), Brueghel, Velasquez, and Thomas Patch. How fortunate you are, my dearest.
      Back in this island I heard a Louis MacNeice version of Cinderella, sometimes [vulgar], funny sometimes. I was delighted for the godmother, an old thing with a Belsize Square central European accent who sang "I fly through the air with the greatest of ease" when travelling by broomstick.
      I had time for this postscript I'm glad to say.
      I love you.
