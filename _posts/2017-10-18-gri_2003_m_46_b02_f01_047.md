      Blackheath
      31st January 1949
      Dearest Sylvia,

      I hope that you caught the train or
      that, if you did miss it, you caught
      a bus easily at the other end.

      I was sad when I got back without
      you but I set to work and this morning
      completed my Ben and Frances review.
      Also my Observer reviews, at last. By
      working hard I shall keep going until
      you come again!

      Last night I started the Epithalamium,
      writing 72 lines straight off. Lots of
      work still to be done, of course, but it
      is a start. It is the direct result
      of your visit, inspiring me, literally as
      a Muse does, and I can only hope that the music
      and the images are not too unfaithful to
      your beauty and the longing you rouse in
      me. I will send you passages soon.

      I know that this room is unpleasing
      but I do value your acceptance of it for
      the time being and it will leave us a
      lot of time to work, with two meals settled.
      I am glad you saw the flat for I know you
      were not hopeful about it.
