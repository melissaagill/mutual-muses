      I suppose that you do not have much
      chance to paint with the Fete and your
      rehearlals, but do let me know
      any work you do, no matter how
      small. I look forward to hear-
      ing, too, how the Fete turn out. To-
      day the weather is what I call divine.
      Maybe Tiny was right about the
      rain - getting it over I mean.

      My lectures are going well and last
      night's discussion at the ICA seemed
      to me about the last I've been in or
      heard. David Sylveste & Patrick
      Heron were excellent. (Both David &
      Robert Nelville said how much they liked my
      Sutherland piece in Art News, which was
      nice of them.)
