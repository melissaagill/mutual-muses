      very flattering letter from Albert Ellis
      at 12.15 yesterday afternoon I
      was quietly home after having called on
      Beryl for 1/2 hr. after painting on the
      level. I am going to "Humphreys", what
      I'm sure George would call their "new
      abode" tomorrow late
      afternoon to help Beryl to cook their
      fish meal on the electric cooker -
      she promises me sherry! Poor George
      has had such awful neuralgia he
      could not sleep or even wash his face -
      codeine, recommended and
      provided by nurse See has done the
      touch!
      I will find out about the Slans.
      There is going to be a pantomime
      with Mr. Thorpe on the "Dame!
      "Aladin and Out" - I ask you,
      as mother would say! Mrs. Bangor
      is not having anything to do with
      it and I am not included
