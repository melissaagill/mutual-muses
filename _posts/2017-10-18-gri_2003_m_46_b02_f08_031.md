      Blackheath     21 ix 1949

      Dearest Sylvia,

      Your two letters have just come and thank you for
      them so much.  Especially the first one which is charm-
      ing and loving.  You must read the poems once more for
      you have misread In Defence of Water if you find anything
      of dissatisfaction it it.  It is a description of how
      happy I was loving you, expressed in terms as if Water
      were a neglected minor painter whom we wished to re-
      habilitate.  Certainly the one about Time was divided
      but not the other:  read it again immediately, please.

      'Look not Westward to the fall of Don Phoebus,
      but to the East;  Eastward Hoe'.  (Chapman)

      Like gardeners sleepy on the cliff
      Appearing upsidedown to the birds
      The poet sleeps through the laws of speech
      Ennuciated by the stones
      And planetary totems:

      Syntax is the beachboud shells
      I make as formal as a sigh
      Or a gesture of repose
      All the lasitude of reason
      Careless and certain of its news.

      Aubades are endless and profane
      Exclude regressive visitors
      To the market of the sky.
      Dew dissolves the slaves of bitumin.
      Cantatas bubble in the air.

      The corridor of dream and day
      Is out province and our centre
      with blue mosaics underfoot:
      Magic carpets and gold birds
      Spin their cartwheels in the sky
      When I wake to Sylvia.
