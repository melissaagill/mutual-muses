      2 I must say I find it highly unatt-
      ractive.
      If it weren't going to be your
      birthday I wouldn't write - why
      should I, you get my letters days
      late and I don't know where you'll
      be - I'm fed up with you for being
      so dammed secretive about it.

      Marjorie has gone off to little
      Hampton to-day until Wednesday
      night. Clifford has gone up to Harley
      Street to clear matters up and
      go to the funeral which is to-
      morrow morning. If he has time,
      (i.e. does not have to se tho [unclear][/unclear]
      afterwards) he will come
      to your lecture - if you are giving
      it - at the Tate. I asked him
      to bring you up at Wimbledon if
      he doesn't get to the lecture -
      it's really a wasted of time to
      tell you for I'm sure you will be
