      The Blackheath Press - you know, publishers
      of the guide - will do it for under 12.

      Molly is much better tho, it seems, her chest
      is still sensitive.

      The 100s of Lions new coinage is under
      discussion at present. Here is the 100s of Lions
      half-crown:

      However, rad-
      ical lions
      wish this de-
      sign to be
      used:

      The weight of opinion is with the rec-clarric
      lions, however. The night had me [unclear]modello[/unclear]
      & [unclear]Warrily[/unclear].

      The weather - surprise - is now wet &
      snowy. Just the weather for happy Ban-
      stead. "Bring the family to our snowy
      crests" - if they don't behave themselves -

      By the way VP has a sweet, friendly
      kitten.

      I adore you Sylvia
      love you
