      3. Saturday. Thank you for your dear letters -
      I can't thank you enough for all your
      kindness to me. I do appreciate it,
      expecially as I know you I so busy.
      I enclose another 25 envelopes -
      you shall have more if you need
      them, also some stamps - you shall
      have more of those too if you let me
      know. I think "Modern Woman" a wonder-
      ful idea - I can't think what to say
      to "Homes and Gardens" But I will think
      of something over the week-end. I
      will write to Iris.
      Thank you so much for ringing
      Chase and for ringing again to-day.
      I told him to send you 50 cards direct.
      I will tell him to send 75. I
      realize that we are not so rushed as
      I thought - but I'm rather glad I thought
      so for I think as Mrs Burrell would
      say Chase to rather "an afternoon customer".
      Thank you for the dates - I will
      make arrangements accordingly. I
      am longing to see you. Thank you so
      much for getting my Pengilly's picture.
