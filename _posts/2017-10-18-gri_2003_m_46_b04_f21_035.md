      Garden furniture - she is hoping that
      Lionel will come to tea! I very much
      like the picture of Dandy lecturing. How
      did your mother and Dorothy enjoy it?
      Is Dorothy at all congascent with
      painting? It sounds an awfully good
      lecture, I wish I had heard it!
      I must say I envy the Smiths hearing
      your lectures - they sound fascinating - and
      I am very charmed that they like me
      and miss me - it's rather unusual - all

      doubts as to your own popularity
      after all these years! and their liking
