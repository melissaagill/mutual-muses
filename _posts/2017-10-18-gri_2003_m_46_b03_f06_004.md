      2nd July
      Good morning, my sweetheart. I hope you slept as well as I did for I had a
      much needed sleep just short of 10 hours. I feel a little heavy as a result but I
      shall be better soon. I have moved the arm chair and table so I am seated
      [unclear]thus[/unclear], ready to work hard in maximum comfort:

      So I can have books all round me, you
      know how many I use when I start writing.
      The round table is still perfectly firm &
      supports a [unclear]mass of MSS[/unclear]. [unclear]Haning[/unclear] outlined
      the decor for my day's work so I do hope
      that you will be able to continue with
      your work today - either The Rest on the Flight or one of your landscapes as
      it seems to be very fine indeed. I have fixed me Reading into its frame and
      hung it on the wall near the door and I think it anybody at Pett who did not
      like it were to see it now their objections would be reduced - it looks
      really admirable. I am delighted by it.
      By the way my father has given me a copy of the ISPA with all [unclear]those[/unclear] int-
      eresting articles that we read. IC is imperfect if the loss of the back [unclear]voge[/unclear] so
      Father was able to give it to me. Isn't that lucky - for you know how expen-
      sive it is.
      Thank you for all THREE ration books. I will send them back on Tuesday
      after I've got the tea.
      I love you so much my rose, my exquisite love, beauty. I think of you
      all the time & feel so happy at images of you. I adore you. Would you were
      here, my sweetheart. However you are present as Minervan Muse, inspiring
      me to work, which I shall now do.
      I love you
      Lawrence
