      Blackheath
      27 I 1950

      Dearest Sylvia,

      I have got your button. I would have bought more than one if I could, but this was the only one they had left.

      Schimanski was very nice and not at all as his letter made us suspect him. He has given me a book about Edward ("Omar") Fitzgerald to review and is reading my Third Man article: without having read it he almost committed himself to publishing it and he wants me to see Bicycle Thieves and The Miracle and write about one of them. He also wants to see a Hogarth chapter with a view to publishing it: I shall give him the chapter I am writing now.

      You've seen the Statesman today? Both my reviews are in.

      I enclose the Mahon review which I got at Gainborough's yesterday.

      Here is a poem, my dove:

      No news my rocaille, my spoon
      Of delights and shafts tumescent,
      How is it that you have not heard
      By way of dream or hunch or moon
      What I perform in the Void,
      The Interregnum, the Royal absent?

      You are, then, exempt from the visit
      Of roofless muse and mouse of fear
      Rattling in the wainscot, running
      Along the veins to flutter in the wrist,
      Or like someone lately sunning
      Deluged by baroque states of a tear.

      BLACKHEATH 27 I 1950

      Dearest Sylvia,

      I have got your button. I would have bought more than one if I could, but this was the only one they had left.

      Schimanski was very nice and not at all as his letter made us suspect him. He has given me a book about Edward ('Omar') Fitzgerald to review and is reading my Third Man article: without having read it he almost committed himself to publishing it and he wants me to see Bicycle Thieves and The Miracle and write about one of them. He also wants to see a Hogarth chapter with a view to publishing it: I shall give him the chapter I am writing now.

      You've seen the Statesman today? Both my reviews are in.

      I enclose the review which I got at Gainsborough's yesterday.

      Here is a poem, my dove:

      No news my rocaille, my spoon
      Of delights and shafts tumescent,
      How is it that you have not heard
      By way of dream or hunch or moon
      What I perform in the Void,
      The Interregnum, the Royal absent?

      You are, then, exempt from the visit
      Of roofless muse and mouse of fear
      Rattling in the wainscot, running
      Along the veins to flutter in the wrist,
      Or like someone lately sunning
      Deluged by baroque states of a tear.
