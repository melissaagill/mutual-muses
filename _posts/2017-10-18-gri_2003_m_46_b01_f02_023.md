    annotation_text: "Hotel de l'Anenis\nRue Gay Lussac\nParis, V\nSaturday\nMy dearest
      Sylvia,\nI was in a book shop in les Reu de Rivoli this afternoon, thinking
      of you as usual, when I saw a book that reminded me of you, and had to buy it.
      Proust's La Prisonniere. I read the first few pages in the Tuileries Gardens.
      Toy boats in the pond, Proust's invalid [unclear]precisions[/unclear], a baking
      sun. I am very tired tonight so this letter will not be finished until to-marrow
      but I feel impelled to [unclear]ealte[/unclear] on. \nHave you, I wonder, decided
      on your hat as yet? Have you made any decision about the altar cloth yet? The
      clothes here  are admirable - the men's far more than the women's. Naff in the
      champs elysees, perhaps, but here in the Latin Quarter it is [unclear]so[/unclear].
      The selection of [unclear]siems[/unclear] on the other hand (unlike the range
      of [unclear]nadder[/unclear] and cambridge blue ties in [unclear]strips[/unclear])
      is very poor. I've  seen 2 tedious Italian [unclear]seims[/unclear]. London
      offers more-much more.\nVery roughly I imagine my remaining money will last
      two more weeks, or just one. I have 13,000 + left. I could make it last longer
      but, you know Sylvia, I don't want to postpone (spelling?) seeing you again.
      I get moods of ex-ceptional distraction. I expect your reception of the new
      will be ambivalent, but what can I do - I am helplessly in the grip of such
      desire. \nI have not done the [unclear]culists[/unclear] yet so occupied have

      Hotel de L'Arenis
      Rue Gay Lussac
      Paris, V
      Saturday
      My dearest Sylvia
      I was in a bookshop in the Rue de Rivoli this afternoon, thinking of you as usual, when I saw a book that reminded me of you, and had to buy it.  Proust's 'La Prisonniere'.  I read the first few pages in the Tuileries Gardens.  Toy boats in the pond, Proust's invalid precisions, a baking sun.  I am very tired tonight so this letter will not be finished until tomorrow and I feel impelled to battle on.
      Have you, I wonder, decided on your hat as yet?  Have you made any decisions about the altar cloth yet?  The clothes here are admirable - the men's far more than the women's.  Not in the Champs Elysees perhaps but here in the Latin Quarter it is so.  The selection of films on the other hand (until the range of [unclear]madder[/unclear] and [unclear]cambridge[/unclear] here lies in strips) is very poor.  I've seen 2 tedious Italian films.  London offers more much more.
      Very roughly I imagine my remaining money will last two more weeks, or just one.  I have 13,000 f left.  I would make it last longer but, you know Sylvia, I don't want to postpone (spelling?) seeing you again.  I expect your reception of the news will be ambivalent but what can I do - I am helplessly in the grip of such desire.
      I have not done the cubists yet so occupied have I been with the Vienna pictures but I've not forgotten and I think I can borrow a typewriter which is fortunate for Clifton Taylor.  He won't have the ordeal of my handwriting.
      Before going to bed I must repeat - I adore you.  When I come back we must somehow have a night.  Can you - is there any hope of arranging it?  I do hope so, my love.
