      at the moment. I have too much critical work on hand. I plan to complete it in the near-future, however - if I abandoned rhyme it would be relatively simple but I want to complete it in the form I have used so far. I apologise for my laborious note. So glad C. likes The Giants.

      This morning I must arrange about the lantern for the Sex Evening. I shall say I want a blue lens. I'll let C know what I arrange, shortly.

      I am glad your cold is better. Be careful to be warmly dressed when you paint out-of-doors, won't you. It is fine today, here, but really awfully cold.

      I treasure you my love

      adore you
      Lawrence

      P.S. 'Fructides' in the poem is the equivalent of late-August, early-September (including 17th) of the French Revolutionists' new calendar.
