      Dearest Lawrence,
      Thank you for your Wimbledon letter and the delightful drawing of Dandylion gazing at my venetian water-colour, I'm so glad that you still like it.
      I am very pleased to hear of your large audience - what was the lecture? Did your father enjoy it? I'm glad you went to the pictures with him - it sounds a good one.
      Yes, mind you answer my letter!
      You know what see's are!
      I wonder if you would be so kind as to answer by return to tell me if you are expecting me definitely within the next week - say Friday? Because M. would like to know if I am coming up this week=end to Cambridge

      at my Venetian<br/>water-colour, I'm so glad that<br/>you still like it.<br/><br/>I
      am very pleased to hear of your<br/>large audience - what was the<br/>lecture?  Did
      your father enjoy it?<br/>I'm glad you went to the pictures <br/>with him -
      it sounds a good one.<br/><br/>Yes, mind you answer my letter!<br/>You know
      what see's are!<br/><br/>I wonder if you would be so kind<br/>as to answer by
      return to tell me if<br/>you are expecting me definitely within<br/>the next
      week - say Friday?  Because<br/>M. would like to know if I am<br/>coming up
      this weekend to Cambridge<br/>
