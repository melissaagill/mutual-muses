      22nd November.

      Dearest Sylvia,

      Thank you for your letters which came this morning. I was very happy to have them. The one you wrote on the 19th only came today with the one dated yesterday. So you see there had been a long gap.

      I am so pleased you like my poems. May I say, in return. how delightfully you receive them. I think that my poems are symbolised by the mirror I hold in our portrait, the mirror reflecting your garlanded head.

      Your black-berry leaves sound lovely. I do look forward to receiving a painting. You are spoiling me, I am glad to say, for you know  how I adore your work.  Have you done anything to your profile in our portrait?

      Too bad about Lines' secretary. Is that the woman who paid me? All I can remember about her is her saying: `Aren´t you nervous? I would be. Don´t you feel nervous before a lecture? Don´t you mind. Oh, I would', and so on.

      I must correct Johnson´s account of Dennis and I who can more accurately be described as separable companions.

      I went to Hampton Court again yesterday and saw a new picture - an early 18th century view of the whole layout. There were charming knot gardens between the river and palace (trees now mainly) and in front of the palace a fine collection of fountains. Alas, no more.

      My plan for rooms was, if my enquiries among friends is fruitless, to look round in the ten days or so before Christmas and then, if I found somewhere suitable, take it, so we could move in soon after. It would only mean paying rent without being there for a short period then. What do you think?

      Dearest, I long for you. I love you.
      Lawrence

      22nd November.

      Dearest Sylvia,

      Thank you for your letters which came this morning. I was very happy to have them. The one you wrote on the 19th only came today with the one dated yesterday. So you see there had been a long gap.

      I am so pleased you like my poems. May I say, in return, how delightfully you receive them. I think that my poems are symbolised by the mirror I hold in our portrait, the mirror reflecting your garlanded head.

      Your black-berry leaves sound lovely. I do look forward to receiving a painting. You are spoiling me, I am glad to say, for you know how I adore your work. Have you done anything to your profile in our portrait?

      Too bad about Lines' secretary. Is that the woman who paid me? All I can remember about her is her saying: 'Arn't you nervous? I would be. Don't you feel nervous before a lecture? Don't you mind. Oh, I would ', and so on.

      I must correct Johnssn's account of Dennis and I who can more accurately be described as seperable companions.

      I went to Hampton Court again yesterday and saw a new picture - an early 18th century view of the whole layout. There were charming knot gardens between the river and palace (trees now mainly) and in front of the palace a fine collection  of fountains. Alas, no more.

      My plan for rooms was, if my enquiries among friends is fruitless, to look round in the ten days or so before Christmas and then, if I found somewhere suitable, take it, so we could move in soon after. It would only mean paying rent without being there for a short period then. What do you think?

      Dearest, I long for you. I love you,
      Lawrence

    clean_transcription: '22nd November.<br/><br/>Dearest Sylvia,<br/><br/>Thank you
      for your letters which came this morning. I was very happy to have them. The
      one you wrote on the 19th only came today with the one dated yesterday. So you
      see there had been a long gap.<br/><br/>I am so pleased you like my poems. May
      I say, in return, how delightfully you receive them. I think that my poems are
      symbolised by the mirror I hold in our portrait, the mirror reflecting your
      garlanded head.<br/><br/>Your black-berry leaves sound lovely. I do look forward
      to receiving a painting. You are spoiling me, I am glad to say, for you know
      how I adore your work. Have you done anything to your profile in our portrait?<br/><br/>Too
      bad about Lines'' secretary. Is that the woman who paid me? All I can remember
      about her is her saying: ''Arn''t you nervous? I would be. Don''t you feel nervous
      before a lecture? Don''t you mind. Oh, I would '', and so on.<br/><br/>I must
      correct Johnssn''s account of Dennis and I who can more accurately be described
      as seperable companions.<br/><br/>I went to Hampton Court again yesterday and
      saw a new picture - an early 18th century view of the whole layout. There were
      charming knot gardens between the river and palace (trees now mainly) and in
      front of the palace a fine collection  of fountains. Alas, no more.<br/><br/>My
      plan for rooms was, if my enquiries among friends is fruitless, to look round
      in the ten days or so before Christmas and then, if I found somewhere suitable,
      take it, so we could move in soon after. It would only mean paying rent without
      being there for a short period then. What do you think?<br/><br/>Dearest, I
      long for you. I love you,<br/>Lawrence'
