      Monday morning
      After a night in which I had complicated and anxious dreams about the PRB
      I have woken to the shining crystal of day which has 4 facets, one for each page
      of your letter.
      You say you may be able to come on Friday - that would be marvel-
      lous.  However, I shall - as Coleridge recommended - 'suspend belief'
      until you actually say when you are coming definitely.  Be sure I will meet
      you whenever it is.
      I am amused to hear that Desiree and Carol are now small sees - in every
      way be the essential ones, of course.  You should be flattered and not in
      the least ashamed.  No - on re-reading your letter it must be Mary Jane or
      Caro who are imitating you - for you describe them both as 'rapatrous (rap-
      acious) and that Desiree never is.
      Isn't it phantastic about the Kensington Gallery show!  They are all paying
      something towards it, of course. CJ & Payrer have sent me cards but I
      have no intention of reviewing it.  Moronic Raynor-Banlan to leave
      out Madeleine and yourself!  I kept my article as a surprise for my
      cat - I felt a reader of ART NEWS needed surprises!
      Savage reminds me of the art-dealer in Samuel Foote's Taste &
      CANTO 'the very mutilation of this piece are worth all the most perfect
      performance of modern artists'.
      NOVICE 'Great! Amazing! Divine! I'm ravished! Transported! So decent!
      So grave! - Is it a man or a woman?"
      and later on
      'How the Devil would we distinguish the works of the Ancients if
      they were perfect?
      The Bust's nose in missing:
      CANTO "The nose itself without the head, in another's possession, would
      be an estate."  But here are an Equestrian Statues of Marcus
      Aurelius without the Horse & a complete statue of the Emperor
      Trojan until only the Head & legs missing'.
      Today you will be painting Desiree.  I am sure that will be enjoyable.
      I shall be getting my lectures ready then this evening I am going to
      the Rex to see war film and a Western (War Correspondent & Hell Town)
      I love you, dearly, dearly.
      (adore you)

      ''rapatious'' (rap-<br/>acious) and that Desiree never is.<br/>     Isn''t it
      phantastic about the Kensington Gallery show! They are all paying<br/>something
      towards it, of course. CJ & Poyrer have sent me cards but I<br/>have no intention
      of reviewing it. Maranic Rayner-Bonham to leave<br/>out Madeleine and yourself!
      I kept my article as a surprise for my<br/>cat - I felt a reader of ART NEWS
      needed surprises!<br/>      Savage reminds me of the art-dealer in Samuel Foate''s
      Tarto &<br/>CANTO    ''the very mutilations of this piece are worth all the
      most perfect<br/>Performances of Modern Artists''.<br/>NOVICE     ''Great! Amazing!
      Divine! I''m ravished! Transported! So decent!<br/>so grave! -- Is it a man
      or a woman?''<br/>and later on<br/>      ''How the Devil would we distinguish
      the Works of the Ancients if<br/>they were perfect?<br/>The Bunt''s nose is
      missing:<br/>CANTO     "The Nose itself without the Head, in another''s possession,
      would<br/>be an estate"     But here are an Equestrian Statues of Marcus<br/>Aurelius
      without the Horse & a complete statue of the Emperor<br/>Trajan with only the
      Head and legs missing?<br/><br/>Today you will be painting Desiree: I am sure
      that will be enjoyable.<br/>I shall be getting my lectures ready, then this
      evening I am going to<br/>the REX to see a war film and a Western (War Correspondent
      & Hell Town).<br/><br/>I love you, dearly, dearly.<br/><br/>I adore you<br/>Lawrence
      <br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>'
