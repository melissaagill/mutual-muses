      4    I will buy some more from Heffers
      you must let me know how many
      you will want.  I'm sending to every
      one I can possibly think of!  Do
      save the Kensington cards for me to
      see.  I have had a train leave--
      I shall work out a letter with you
      to the Art Editor of Vogue--and say
      that I make all my own clothes
      from their patterns, that I shall be
      weaving these at the private room,
      and enclose a swap if they come
      out well?  What do you think?
      No harm done?
      I'm so glad the Banstead class is
      going well again.  I was very impress-
      ed by the lecture I heard.  I envy
      you the Wallace.  We must go
      again soon.  I will certainly let
      you have more work for your extra
      lecture.
      I must stop now as Mrs. Owers
      is going to post this.  Hope you enjoy
      the press films.  They sound good.
      I love you
