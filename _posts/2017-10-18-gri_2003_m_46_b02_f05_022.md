           It will take at least a week to get the total £175 (from Hodders and Father) but I shall book on Monday as I say. I don't know when I shall be able to book for but as early as possible is my idea. Will you be ready by the 22nd? I will send you more details after I have been for the tickets. I may need your passport but I'll tell you that in my next letter, too.

           Charles is back and I am having lunch with him on Tuesday. I shall borrow his Baedeker and his phrase-book and collect any advice I can, though I shall believe nothing directly he tells me, indirectly he may be of assistance. (He has a ghastly new suit!)

           Let me know any matters which you think I may forget, overlook, or not know about. I shall write to Domsch in Florence on Monday, too, thus ensuring us a dinner or two. He publishes books on art, as I think I told you.

           Here is a poem for you, my beauty:

                In the purple game of night, a ballet,
                Décor of stars - the souvenirs of day
                And herald of the day - I close with love
                In protean complexity of dreams
                Centered on your one identity.

                Day, and light cascades off the sky's
                Blue roof and dreams are haunted signals
                Flown at the mast of night but lowered

      It will take at least a week to get the total £175 (from Hodders and Father) but I shall book on Monday as I say. I don't know when I shall be able to book for but as early as possible is my idea. Will you be ready by the 22nd? I will send you more details after I have been for the tickets. I may need your passport but I'll tell you that in my next letter.

      Charles is back and I am having lunch with him on Tuesday. I shall borrow his Baedeker and his phrase-book and collect any advice I can, though I shall believe nothing directly he tells me, indirectly he may be assistance. (He has a ghastly new suit!)
      Let me know any matters which you think I may forget, overlook, or not know about. I shall write to Domsch in Florence on Monday, too, thus ensuring us a dinner or two. He publishes books on art, as I think I told you.

      Here is a poem for you, my beauty:

      In the purple game of night, a ballet,
      Decor of stars - the souvenirs of day
      And herald of the day - I close with love
      In protean complexity of dreams
      Centered on your one identity.

      Day, and light cascades off the sky's
      Blue roof and dreams are haunted signals
      Flown at the mast of night but lowered
