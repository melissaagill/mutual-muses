      would catch the public fancy. So after Wright I think that would be a pleasant subject. (Antal suggested it, also, you may remember.)

      When I got there Sir Osbert was just sending his secretary off: they had been answering letters. He told me he had replied to a letter from one public character in these terms:

      Dear Sir,
      thank you for your stupid letter...

      I shall tell you lots more about him when we meet.

      I got your tea yesterday. I bought the more expensive lap-sang and had them send it here. Or do you want it at Pett? If so you can have the cheaper brand, if you want it, from my book, this month.

      How very shocking about Hinds' packing. I'm glad you told me. I had no time yesterday but tomorrow I shall go in to them indignantly. See fig ii.

      Today I intend to finish, if I can, the Hogarth chapter dealing with the Ascension, Lady's Last Stake, and Hogarth's death. Then tomorrow I can draft my David lecture, for which I must try and borrow extra slides from Charley and, perhaps, Helen Rosenau.

      I have been writing some poems (and thinking, incidentally, about poetry in general terms) but nothing is quite finished yet. If I work hard all day perhaps this evening I can finish them.

      Dearest Sylvia, it is as if I were starting this letter, but then I want to close it as I began, dearest Sylvia, with expression of my love. I love you, my ravishing Minerva, I love you,

      Lawrence

      would catch the public fancy.  So after Wright I think that would be a pleasant subject.  (Antal suggested it, also, you may remember.)

      When I got there Sir Osbert was just sending his secretary off:  they had been answering letters.  He told me he had replies to a letter from one public character in these terms:

      Dear Sir,

      Thank you for your stupid letter . . .

      I shall tell you lots more about him when we meet.

      I got your tea yesterday.  I bought the more expensive lap-sang and had them send it here.  Or do you want it at Pett?  If so you can have the cheaper brand, if you want it, from my book, this month,

      How very shocking about Hinds' packing.  I'm glad you told me.  I had not time yesterday but tomorrow I shall go in to them indignantly.  See fig ii.

      Today I intend to finish, if I can, the Hogarth chapter dealing with the Ascension, Lady's Last Stake, and Hogarth's death.  Then tomorrow I can draft my David lecture, for which I must try and borrow extra slides from Charley and, perhaps, Helen Roseneu.

      I have been writing some poems (and thinking, incidentally, about poetry in general terms) but nothing is quite finished yet.  If I work hard all day perhaps this evening I can finish them.

      Dearest Sylvia, it is as if I were starting this letter, but then I want to close it as I began, dearest Sylvia, with expression of my love.  I love you, my ravishing Minerva, I love you,
