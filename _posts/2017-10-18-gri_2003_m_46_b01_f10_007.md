      11 Mansel Road,

      Dearest Sylvia,

      Because the grand-father clock and the
      black one in the dining-room are not quite
      co-ordinated 11 o'clock is celebrated with
      22 chimes which amuses me very much.

      I saw Robert Hart and as far as I can
      make out things are no worse than when
      you were in Italy and the wine-tax seems to
      be negligible. The exhibition at the
      Palazzo Strozzi included Castagno frescoes
      and the Donatello bronze doors but not, I
      asked specially, any Titians. There was
      a suite of Empire furniture, made in Genoa,
      where the style was popular. When Hart
      went to Palazzo Publico in Siena he
      found an American film company there and
      the frescoes powerfully illuminated as a
      background for Tyrone Power who is play-
      ing, alas, Cesare Borgia. The Brera is
      not open, and has not been yet, but the
      'student' can always get in so we'll be
      alright.

      The book on Hogarth to be published by
      The Studio is not formidable. You know
      the orangepocket size books they put out
      before the war. It's one of those - so
      all is well.
