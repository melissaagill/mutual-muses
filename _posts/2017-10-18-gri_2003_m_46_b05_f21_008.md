      Pett
      Dearest Lawrence
      Thank you so much for your dear
      letter. I do hope that you are quite
      well again now.
      By the way have you written to
      [unclear]Limes[/unclear] yet? Tiny says was that cutting
      any good? I said I thought
      so. [unclear]Avel[/unclear] Clifford says you will be sure
      to give him the written lecture on
      Thursday as he is depending on it!
      Think of the American publicity!
      This morning I have been working
      on the "Rinaldo and Armida", it being
      dull with a very cold north wind,
      and have more or less finished A's
      torso having only the legs to do and
      the couch before putting in the background
      and the sky. I am pleased with it!
      and very relieved to have done with
      that bit, for as you know it is very
      awkward!
