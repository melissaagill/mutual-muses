      Blackheath Tuesday 5.8.52

      Dearest Sylvia,
      I spent Sunday evening with my parents who were very well, engorged and fat. So fat is father that I have 'inherited' a new sports shirt which he has worn only once!
      The decorators are coming in to 11 Mansel Road so I had an energetic time helping Father clear certain rooms, take up all the staircarpets, and so on. Splendid exercise...splendid...

      Then in the afternoon Edwards took us for a drive. We went [unclear][/unclear] in Surrey and had a home-made tea at The [unclear]Refectory[/unclear]- a 15c building which has been dolled up but is, nevertheless, charming. We whizzed through a sequence of pretty villages so Lion saw a spire here, a porch there, a green, a statue. The new Red Cross Country House is in the neighbourhood so we visited it. A county mansion built in the 30s it is a horrible fussy Wren pastiche but the grounds are charming, extensive, varied, perched on the side of a great hill. We obtained some peaches from the gardener.

      Tuesday Blackheath Dearest Sylvia,

      [unclear][/unclear] and fat. so fat is father that I have 'inherited' a new
      sports shirt which he has worn only once!

      The decorators are coming in to 11 Mansel Road, so I had an
      energetic time helping Father clear certain rooms, take up all
      the staircarpets, and so on. Splendid exercise... splendid....

      Then in the afternoon Edwards
      took us for a drive. We went to
      Godalming in Surrey and had a
      home-made tea at The Recfectory -
      a 15  building which has been dolled
      up but is, [unclear][/unclear] charming.
      We whizzed through a sequence of
      pretty villages so Lion saw a
      spire here, a porch there, a green,
      a statue. The new Red Cross
      County House is the neighbourhood so we visited it. A county
      mansion built in the 30's it is a horrible fussy Wren particle but
      the grounds are charming, extensive, varied, perched on the side
