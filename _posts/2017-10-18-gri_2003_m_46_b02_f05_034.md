      Tuesday 17 May
      Dearest Sylvia
      Your watercolour (waiting for me when I got
      home last night) is enchanting. When you
      can paint like that for your love with
      such felicitous grace and lyrical feel-
      ing then I cannot be too worried by
      your misgivings on the phone. It is a
      beautiful love-message and let me
      say in passionate return that I love
      you, love you, love you.

      I'm sorry not to have been a good corres-
      pondent last week but your letters did
      not inspire and I felt rather limp. Your
      letter is fairly confident and loving and
      - taken with your watercolour - does your
      lion much good. On the phone, though,
      you had misgivings. I'm glad I am com-
      ing on Friday. I love you - do not
      doubt it and do not, being sure of it,
