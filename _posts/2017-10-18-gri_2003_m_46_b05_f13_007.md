      Pett
      Dearest Lawrence,
      Its quite right.  I'm just frightfully
      over tired.  I ache.  I worry too
      much I think.  Tiny thought perhaps
      I had a temperature.  I hadn't, but
      I'm slightly more below normal than
      one shoulnd be, for normally than
      one should be, for normall I am
      nomral!  I'm sleeping well however and
      shall take things easy, My Witlow is
      still swollen, but I think it will be all
      right as the infection seems to be at the
      side of the nart ad not underneath
      I keep bathing it.
      I think I will take the 10:10
      on the 6th.  for I would very much
      like to hear it your lecture and then I could relax
      on the 7th.  The train arrives about
      12:30  if you can't meet it don't worry
      for I shall come on and find you out
      the Tate.
      I'm so gald that you are writing
      poems, and shall so look forward

      quite right - I'm just frightfully over-tired - I ache - I worry too much I
      think. Tiny thought perhaps I had a temperature - I hadn't, but I'm slightly
      more below normal than one should be - for normally I am normal! I'm sleeping
      well however and shall take things easy- my [unclear]witlon[/unclear] is still
      swollen, but I think it will be all right as the infection seems to be at the
      side of the nail and not underneath - I keep bathing it.\n   I think I will
      take the 10.10 on the 6th. for I would very much like to hear it (your lecture)
      and then I could relax on the 7th. The train arrives about 12.3. If you can't
      meet it don't worry for I shall come on and find you at the Tate.\n   I'm so
      glad that you are writing poems, and shall so look forward "
