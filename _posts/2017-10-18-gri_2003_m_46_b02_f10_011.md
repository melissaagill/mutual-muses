      Charles has given me two more lectures and he was pleasantly helpful about the small  points concerning [unclear]Ingres[/unclear] about which I asked his advice.

      With rare good fortune - of the kind that comes to this lion more often than one should strictly expect - I focerd 2nd hand in Birmingham the very Burlington Cornelius Russell had been recommending, containing the article about Watteau's borrowing from the Carracie.

      I rang Sherwood but he has no news of your [unclear]Morours[/unclear] Paper unfortunately. He said, which seemed curious, "if I'd know it were yours - and I had found it I should have sent it to you" which made me think , for a second, he had had it and had it no longer. That is was a guilty slip. But when I talked further with him the suspicion evaporated. If you have time I recommend a scientific look for it at Pett.

      [unclear]Charlie[/unclear] & I,  by the way, mentioned [unclear]Stokes' [/unclear]new book and he said it sounded very interesting. I shall have it for you in about a week - Mineverva, my muse, my scholar, erudite cat and consummate beauty.
      I fear the fog may delay the train's arrival in Londen. It was ten minutes late at Snow Hill! So, perhaps, I'll be back about six.

      I send you the most beneficient  [unclear]winds[/unclear] for your Monday lecture. [unclear]Aia muse[/unclear] of great experience I know you will [unclear]take[/unclear] the PARAGONE in your studio.

      Oh Sylvia I love you - I adove you

      and had it no longer. That is was a guilty slip. But when I talked further with
      him the suspicion evaporated. If you have time I recommend a scientific look
      for it at Pett.  & I, by the way, mentioned Stokes' new book and he said it
      sounded very interesting. I shall have it for you in about a week-Minerva, my
      muse, my scholar, erudite cat and consummate beauty. I fear the fog may delay
      the train's arrival in London. It was ten minutes late at Snow Hill! So, perhaps,
      I'll be back about six. I send you the most beneficient wishes for your Monday
      lecture. As a muse of great experience I know you will take the PARAGONE in
      your stride.  Oh Sylvia I love you. I adore you Lawrence
