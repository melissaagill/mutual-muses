      garden for sylvia
      Tall pink and scarlet tulips master
      The foreground with their height
      And wind rouses the laburnams.

      Equestrians of cloud
      Rear above the green balustrades
      That ring three sides of the lawn.

      The copper beech burns like a trophy:
      Such colours as of sun and blood
      Against the green and silver trees.

      Under the chestnut a pink pool
      Of fallen blossom on the path
      Is like reflected colour from the rose.

      This is the garden I have picked for you,
      My beauty of the open and the flower.
