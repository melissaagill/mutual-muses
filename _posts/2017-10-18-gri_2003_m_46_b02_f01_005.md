      2nd January 1949 Wimbledon
      Dearest Sylvia,
      Thank you for your letter -which came by the afternoon post- I hope mine did too.
      Yes, please come to London on Wednesday - although you could go direct from Hastings- so that we can do most of the journey together. I will get the tickets and times on Monday. I do not know any hotels in Birmingham but Paul says that it will not be difficult to get anywhere we like as the midlands hotels are not crowded.
      I shall bring the current Burlington which has two articles on Wilson. Are there any books of mine which you would like me to bring?
      I do agree about Des Demoiselles d' Avignon.  I just sat down and 'stared' at it for ages. Some totem dolls from America reminded me very much of the giants, in shape not size, I hasten to add, in Jack and the Beanstalk which I saw the other evening. I also liked two of the Miros very much.

      Thank you for your letter - which came by the afternoon post - I hope mine did too.

      Yes, please come to London on Wednesday - although you could go direct from hastings - so that we can do most of the journey together.  I will get the tickets and times on Monday.  I do not know any hotels in Birmingham but paul says that it will not be difficult to get in anywhere we like as the midlands hotels are not crowded.

      I shall bring the current Burlington which has two articles on Wilson.  Are there any books of mine which you would like me to bring?

      I do agree about les demoiselles d'avignon.  I must just sat down and 'stared' at it for ages.  Some totem dolls from America reminded me very much of the giants in shape not size, I hasten to add, in Jack and the beanstalk which I saw the other evening.  I also liked two of the miros very much
