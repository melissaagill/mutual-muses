      Provided it is not during<br/>my lecture I can meet you. I can get<br/>to Chasing
      X by 4:30 or - if you come by<br/>''bus - Lewisham by about 5:00.<br/><br/>There
      is a train to  Monday evening<br/>at 4:20 which gets in at 10:53. I<br/>think
      I might well catch that, don''t you?<br/>That shouldn''t be too late and<br/>we
      will have Tuesday free, then.<br/><br/>I do hope that you will soon feel better.<br/>I
      will do my best to soothe you, my<br/>poor ruffled cat. The holiday will<br/>do
      you worlds of good, I know: me,<br/>too.<br/>I love & adore you<br/>Lawrence<br/>'
