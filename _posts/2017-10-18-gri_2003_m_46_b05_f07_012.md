      Would it worry you to lend me 13 for
      the rent?  I woe Mrs. Harrison two months.  I
      have the money for one month, but not for the
      other month.  I will pay you back, either
      when Britania and Eve accept my Western article
      or in October after my weekend course for which
      I recieve 15, so it is guaranteed back to you
      by October (3 months off) and cannot harm
      your exhibition money.  I would not let
      any action of mine threaten your show:  you
      know that.
      This morning I hunted for your pearls but
      without success.  I have not had the drawers
      out, however, so do not be too hopeless yet.
      I have a lecture, here (the NG) at 12.00.
      To some American students of economics.
      This afternoon I am going to the private view
      of XXth Masterpieces at the TG before return-
      ing home.
      If you can help me with a cheque I will
      be grateful and I promise it is safe.  By the
      way, I have started writing to publishers again:
      something may come of it.
      I adore and love you
      I love you.
