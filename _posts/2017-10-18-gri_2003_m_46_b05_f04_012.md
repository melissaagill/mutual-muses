      him very well. He enquired after you and sent his love to you.
      Lion went to the pictures yesterday and saw Viva Zapata: it has some silly moments but it has also some admirable things. It is Steinbeck versus Mexico and happily Mexico has a say in it. Brando is good as the peasant - less good after his rise to power. He is not able to think on screen very well, I feel. Nonetheless were you to have the chance to see it in Hastings I think you should: the violence is small and not well done so you wouldn't mind too much.
      I am so glad that you are still in The Golden Amulet. You know that your power is absolute on stage! But absolute. I hope that you will abuse it shamefully. Seriously, do tell me all - all - about it.
      I love you so much. I shall think of you all weekend. Think of me. I shall be writing letter for publishers part of the time.
           I love you   I love you

      him very well. He enquired after you and sent his love to you.
      Lion went to the pictures yesterday and Viva Zapata: it has some silly moments but it has also some admirable things. It is Steinbeck versus Mexico and happily Mexico has a say in it. Brando is good as the peasant - less good after his rise to power. He is not able to think on screen very well, I feel. Nonetheless were you to have the chance to see it in Hastings I think you should: the violence is small and not well done so you wouldn't mind too much.
      I am so glad that you are still in The Golden Amulet. You know that your power is absolute on stage! But absolute. I hope that you will abuse it shamefully. Seriously, do tell me all - all - about it.
      I love you so much. I shall think of you all weekend. Think of me: I shall be writing letters for publishers part of the time.
      I love you love you
      Lawrence
