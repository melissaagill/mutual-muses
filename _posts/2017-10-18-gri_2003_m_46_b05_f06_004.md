      THE RESORT
      Placid collapse of sky,
      Pushing water to this flatness,
      Dulling words to silence.

      Succulent words and flashing signs
      Are blackened and inert
      Against the glaring sun.

      Two clowns named Day and Noon
      Worked for the Swanee tribe:
      black masks and white of words.

      SUMMER

      I can remember when the grass
      Grew when I wasn't looking
      Grew when I turned my back.

      The white hats of tomorrow
      Are tiny and high up
      On the blue hat stand of the sky.

      I remember how you lay still
      As I looked at the grass
      And had not moved when I returned.

      ON HEROINES IN CERTAIN SOUTHERN WRITERS AND RO-
      MANTIC PAINTERS

      Mostly the women are supposed to fall
      Off columns, like a sculptured pediment
      And on the ground yield to the common weeds.

      In that oral south, all words and julip,
      Except for swinging negroes, porticoes
      lead upwards to a violated roof.

      Or like a painter's timeless shore, the piers
      Reduced to sections, scattered in the sand:
      Only the dying footprints lead away.

      The exercise of honour has fallen
      Into disuse, its muscles are buried.
      Only the machine of a horse
      Afternoons the garden with a phallic shadow.

      SUMMER
      I can remember when the grass

      Grew when I turned my back.
      The white hats of tomorrow
      Are tiny and high up
      On the blue hat stand of the sky.
      I remember how you lay still
      As I looked at the grass
      And had not moved when I returned.
      ON HEROINES IN CERTAIN SOUTHERN WRITERS AND ROMANTIC PAINTERS
      Mostly the women are supposed to fall
      Off colums, like a sculptured pediment
      And on the ground yield to the common weeds.
      In that oral south, all words and julip,
      Except for swinging negroes, porticoes
      Lead upwards to a violated roof.
      Or like a painter's timeless shore, the piers
      Reduced to sections, scattered in the sand:
      Only the dying footprints lead away.
      The exercise of honour has fallen
      Into disuse, its muscles are buried.
      Only the machine of a torse
      Afternoons the garden with a phallic shadow.

      THE RESORT

      Placid collapse of sky
      rushing water to this flatness,
      Dulling words to silence.

      Succulent words and flashing signs
      Are blackened and inert
      Against the glaring sun.

      Two elements named Day and Moon
      Worked for the Swanee tribe:
      Black masks and white of words.

      SUMMER

      I can remember when the grass
      Grew when I wasn't looking
      Grew when I turned my back.

      The white hats of tomorrow
      Are tiny and high up
      On the blue hat stand of the sky

      I remember how you lay still
      As I looked at the grass
      And had not moved when I returned.
