      will need water for a day or two - it can be put on the window sill now as I am sure that there cannot be any green fly left.
      I am very pleased with the prospect of my show and shall work very hard - at least it will make me produce a lot of work and I hope will make a ripple on the surface of  - I can't finish this rather silly metaphor!
      I have arrived safely at Pett, and managed to catch the 4.45 'bus - which was very pleasant. Tiny and Clifford seem well and cheerful - they asked tenderly after you.
      I shall mend stockings this evening and go to bed early - to tidy up tomorrow and continue with my painting.
      I will try to find that negative for you, and if I do, enclose it.
      I love you so much and long to be with you again.
      I love you
      Sylvia
