      3 Somerset Maughan has been popular with film makers and Noel Coward's one-act plays have also been used; America has reverently taken O. Henry from the shelf which usually only appears in trailers; Max Ophuls has adapted Guy de Maupassant. Original film scripts are often reminiscent of the first story type, too: many critics compared the episodies of Paisa de Maupassant.
      The short-story in the de Maupassant-Maughan manner encourages distrust. We read the story, watch the scene established vividly - provincial France, the British Empire - or what have you : we may be taken with the man's economy and precision. We meet, as it were, the people: the charming woman or the beastly man, say, and if one is au fait with the idiom a question rises. This charming woman, will she seem charming at the end of the story, this brute, is he totally low? Unlikely, for this type of short story requires a twist, either of situation, values, or character: complacency is overturned, heartlessness is circuitously vindicated, affection brilliantly short circuits itself, and so on. The obligatory angle is the expression of a Digest-scepticism. The short story is a vehicle for fragmentary insights, produced by the dictates of literary form as much as by an attitude to life. The attitude follows the form, not the other way about. I venture to guess, without any statistical support whatsoever, that most readers of the short story are not students of literary form. However they frequently accept the crisp and tiny worldliness of the short story and assume it to be valid outside the formal limits of the game.
