      -II-

      I have got an interesting book [unclear]released from the our theory[/unclear] of European painters. [unclear]Piers della Froncerca on Perspective, Poursim[/unclear] letters, selections from numerous treatises, [unclear]veronare's[/unclear] interview (the minutes) until the Inquisitions about [unclear]Germans, Russoons, Parrots,[/unclear] etc. It is a fat American volume. By the way, will you keep the Morison article on Cervantes for me, please? At the moment I'm trying to find time to read La Perte.

      By the way, Ricky seems to know a friend of Michael's, Bridgeman, I believe, his name is. He told Ricky that in his (Bridgeman's) opinion, you were not very happy. All this he volunteered, but Ricky was ponderously discreet, you may be sure. And I remember Grace Stewart (that is her name [unclear][/unclear] isn't it?) saying the same thing. How I love you, and, though in some ways your suffering may be sharpened, I feel that I have made you happy.

      Now I must stop, have breakfast, and set about my work. I have written this early in the hopeI can post it in time to reach you Saturday morning. I hang upon your next word, my dearest.

      I love you
      Lawrence

      P.S. After the 19th of this month the subsidy is being taken off China tea so that its price will jump to 6s or 7s a lb. You better let me have all the ration books you can muster between the 12th (when the new period starts) and that date and I'll get [unclear]Ian Sang[/unclear] on whatever brand you want while it is feasible.

      I have got an interesting book selected from the art theory of European painters. Piero della Francessca on Perspective, Poussin letters, selections from numeroustreatises, Veronese's interiors (the minutes) until the Inquisition about Semons, Buffoons, Parrots etc. IC is a fat American volume. By the way, will you keep the Horizon article on Cervantes for me, please? At the moment I'm trying to find time to read la Poste.

      By the way, Ricky seems to know a friend of Michael's. Bridgeman, I believe, his name is. He told Ricky that in his (Bridgeman's) opinion, you were not very happy. All this he volunteered, but Ricky wasponderously discreet, you may be sure. And I remember Grace Stewart (that is her name right isn't it?) saying the same thing. How I love you and, though in some ways your suffering may be sharpened, I feel that I have made you happy.

      Now I must stop, have breakfast, and set about my work. I have written this early in the hope I can post it in time to reach you Saturday morning. I hang upon your next word, my dearest.
      I love you
      Lawrence
      P.S. After the 19th of this month the subsidy is being taken off China tea so that is price will jump to 6s or 7s a lb. You better let me have all the ration books you can muster between the 12th (when the new period starts) and that date and I'll get Lap Song or whatever brand you want while it is feasible. L
      As there is this tiny margin at the bottom there is time to say once more what is always in my mind, in my body - I love you.
