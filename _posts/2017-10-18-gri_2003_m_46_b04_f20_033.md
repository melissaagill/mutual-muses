      struggling alone.
      On Thursdays - which was a perfect day Michael went to help Mr. Prior of Elms Farm with the harvest - he is a very nice man and it is convenient-ly near. Jimmy Owens works there and is already most expert at farm work and very happy - he is the one we saw a "snap" of with a fox. Aunt Margaret and Audrey and I went down to the beach where Clifford and Dierdre joined us. It was quite perfect - there wasn't even a wond - or very little! I wish you and Hetty and Lionel and Yawolla had been there. Carol preferred to bathe with Johnny Warnes!! Aunt Margaret and Audrey took me to tea at the "Boat House". It was nice, but not as good as it used to be- of course, we were rather late.
