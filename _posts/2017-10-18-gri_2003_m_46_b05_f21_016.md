      Pett  15-9-52

      Dearest Lawrence,
      I don't feel very loving but extremely
      irritated.  Where are you and what
      are you doing?  I imagine you went
      to Blackheath on Saturday and back
      to Wimbledon on Sunday--but you
      don't seem to have had the letter
      I posted on Friday which should
      have reached you on Saturday--I
      think it was unkind not to have
      written me on Friday.  I felt rather worried
      about you--and you seem to be
      behaving in a very unwise way going
      to the cinema and theatre when you
      are so much below par--for not
      only I you liable I pick up other
      germs but the rapid change of
      atmosphere is extremely bad for
      glads--however I can only
      suppose you like being invalidism

      Dearest Lawrence
      I don't feel very loving but extremely irritated - where are you and what are you doing? I imagine you went to Blackheath on Saturday and back to Wimbledon on Sunday - but you don't seem to have had the letter I posted on Friday which should have reached you on Saturday - I think it was unkind not to have written me on Friday I felt rather worried about you - and you seem to be behaving in a very unwise way going to the cinema and theatre when you are so much below par - for not only are you liable to pick up other germs but the rapid change of atmosphere is extremely bad for glands - however I can only suppose you like being invalidish
