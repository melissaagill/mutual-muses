      Pett 16.10.51
      Dearest lawrence,
      I am so sorry to hear that you have so bad a cold - it is not surprising, if course. I do hope that you will not find this Wednesday too much of a strain and I hope that you will be able to rest a little during the remainder of the week. Poor Lion - it's very hard! I hope also that your poor Papa is alright and not too uncomfortable.
      Tiny is back for the parish meeting - there was one yesterday and there will be one tonight. Apparently all the people at Cliff End save 2, want passionately to belong to Pett rather than Fairlight. They think Fairlight
