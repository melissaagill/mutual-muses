      Dearest Sylvia
      Here is the first draft of the [unclear]Tudor[/unclear] up
      [unclear]to[/unclear] Elizabeth chapter - at least, my part
      of it. Do please let me have your crit-
      icizms of it (though you needn't [unclear]bother[/unclear]
      [unclear]M[/unclear] with it). The [unclear]homes, castle,[/unclear] tapest-
      ries will come in Elizabeth's reign.
      Today I am lunching with friends of
      [unclear]Mac Mole[/unclear]: somebody connected with [unclear]Jilming[/unclear]
      will be there. I doubt if there is a [unclear]chance[/unclear]
      of a job there but I can [unclear]talk[/unclear] the matter over
      with him.
      You [unclear]mention[/unclear] [unclear]Regres-Barlam[/unclear]: I heard his
      lecture on the pre-Raphaelites. He might
      have been at home - or blind - for all the at-
      tention he gave to the pictures around him. I
      think he knew who I was for each time he
      made generalizations I looked thoughtfull
      (& conspicuous) around: then he [unclear]qualified[/unclear]
      what he said, seeing my [unclear]venement[/unclear]. He had
      read a good deal about the (19th [unclear]Ct it[/unclear]

      Dearest Sylvia
      Here is the first draft of the Tudor by
      to Elizabeth chapter--at least, my part
      of it.  Do please let me have your crit-
      icisms of it (though you needn't bother
      M with it).  The hauve, latte, tapest-
      ries will come in Elizabeth's reign.
      Today I am lunching with friends at
      Moe Hole:  somebody connected with filming
      will be there.  I doubth if there is a chance
      of a job there but I can talk with the matte, over
      will him.
      Your Metrlim rayne Bandom:  I heard his
      bedtime on the pre-Raphaelites.  He might
      have been at home --or blind--for all the at-
      tention he gave to the pictures around him.  I
      live heknew who I was for sad time he
      made generalizations.  I looked thoughtful
      be impressional around;  then he qualified
      but he said, seiing my moment.  He found
      record a good deal about the (19th but it
