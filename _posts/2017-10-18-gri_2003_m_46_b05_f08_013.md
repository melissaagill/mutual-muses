      Monday 11-8-52

      Thank you for this morning's letter. I am sorry to hear that the rain which fills the garden stops the art. How frustrating.

      This morning's lecture went well (60-5) though it was not the best I have given I felt. My next one, the last, is a 'request programme': Picasso [unclear]( )[/unclear]; [unclear][/unclear] 'Nude'; [unclear]Molevick[/unclear], and- oh dear I fear I've forgotten something...

      Mrs. Orslow-Ford has given me one of her son's books and promised me another. She is a very sweet woman. You know Gordon Orslow-Ford? I will show you the books when you come. I think I will write to him. He is now in San Francisco. I understand he fled the draft-board in 1940!

      I will give you the train time for next Saturday in tomorrow's letter.

      I am dying to see you

      love you
      Lawrence.
