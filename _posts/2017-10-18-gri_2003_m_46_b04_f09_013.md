      Blackheath
      Sunday Evening
      Dearest Sylvia
      It is half-past ten. I wonder if you are with the Woods - or if you are in bed - or reading. I imagine you in these different situations and wish you were here, with me. Had you been here today I would have read you passages from Holman Hunt's long book about the PRB. As it is I shall tell you a few of the things I have learned: Hunt's Strayed Sleep was painted on the cliffs of Fairlight in 1852. He stayed at Clineden Farm until Lear - Lear being there as his pupil because he wanted to work up his many drawings into paintings. When the 2 men arranged to hire the farm Lear stipulated that they divide the house (as you do with the Woods): later he admitted that he feared Hunt might be a lover of bull-dogs, hence the precaution of living separately. Millais visited them & together they used to walk along the head in Wivelelses - where Lear stayed subsequently. (This simplifies my earlier remark about Lear at Fairlight which was inaccurate.)
      Hunt's book is really very good- somewhat solemn but dignified & ardent in his account of his arc and ideas. I rather admire the man and, very much, some of his drawings.
      Although the curtains are now drawn, all four plants, I am glad to report, are in bloom. I meant to tell you before and now that they are not visible I have remembered. I think you will be here in time to see the flowers.
      My parents have given me a silver salt cellar for Charles Johnson & Madge - (whatever her name is). here is a sketch of it.
      I think that it is suitable - sufficiently impressive to show attentiveness on part, but, yet, perhaps just within my means. Just the thing for a graduated pupil to offer on this ardent occasion. I do hop that it works for both of them.
      I am going to have a bath - then bed. Goodnight - my love.
      L.
