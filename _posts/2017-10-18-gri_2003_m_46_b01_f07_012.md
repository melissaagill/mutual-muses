      Sylvia,\n\n     I had to stop my last letter before I intended to because I
      discovered Saturday morning when I should have finished it that the V and A
      library is closing for a week, and that work I intended to do on Monday had
      to be done Saturday. So I experienced yet more memories of you yesterday when
      I had lunch in that milk bar at South Kensington where we have been, it's called
      'Nic's', I'm afraid. I was sorry not to be able to get a seat where we had been.
      The weather is no better than in my last letter. The Summer seems to be ending
      with a band. Not with a whimper. Perhaps it will revive. You will return to
      a brownish Inghihterra.[unclear][/unclear] You know what Durer said about Germany
      in Venice? 'Oh how cold it will be after the sunshine'.\n\nI have been typing
      out my notes for my first lecture on Tuesday. I have found a mistake in Johnson's
      Flemish Dutch syllabus: He says Vermeer influenced Metsu[unclear][/unclear]
      whereas in fact M foreshadowed V. De Groot points this out in his great work.
      Has not Johnson read this? It was printed 40 years ago. \n\nI don't think that
      the Paris cafe prices are too high but rather that students are not in Paris
      now and that makes a big difference.\n\nYour dress, the Minerva one, does sound
      charming. How I look forward to seeing it. By the way, my trousers are not yet
      dyed. I wasted a lot of time trying to find a cleaner with pastel shades at
      his disposal, and how the best of them is full up and not dying men's things.
      (I think they'll have to be nigger.) Other colors are for export - Fawn and
      so on.\n\nYour account of Pallas and Apollo, side by side was delightful. And
      your sight of space composition in the life must have been thrilling. The huge
      pink shell sounds both Umbrian and like the shell from which Venus stepped.\n\nWhen
      we meet next I shall be very excited to hear if this feast of painting has given
      you any special ideas for new paintings. Of course you were in Italy before
      but this trip is altogether more professional. Will Sienese mannerism be apparent
      in your draftsmanship I wonder? There is so much to talk about. I long for to
      see you. I long for you. \n"

So I experienced yet more memories of you yesterday when I had lunch in that milk bar at South [unclear]Kensington[/unclear]. where we have been, it's called "Nic's", I'm afraid. I was sorry not to be able to get a seat where we had been. The weather is no better than in my last letters. The Summer seem's to be ending with a bang. Not with a whimper. Perhaps it will revive. You will return to brownish Inghihterra. You know what Durer said about Germany in Venice? "Oh how cold it will be after the sunshine".

      I have been typing out my notes for my first lecture on Tuesday. I have found a mistake in Johnson's Flemish Dutch [unclear]e[/unclear] syllabus: he says Vermeer influenced Metsu where as in fact M foreshadowed V. De Groot points this out in his great work. Has not Johnson read this? It was printed 40 years ago.

      I don't think that the Paris cafe prices are too high but rather that students are not in Paris now and that makes a big difference.

      Your dress, the Minerva one, does sound charming. How O look forward to seeing it. By the way, my trousers are not yet died.

      to because I discovered Saturday morning when I should have finished it that the V and A library is closing for a week and that the work I intended to do on Monday had to be done on Saturday. So I experienced yet more memories of you yesterday when I had lunch in that milk bar^ where we have been, its called 'Nici's' i'm afraid. I was sorry not to be able to get a seat where we had beer. the weather is no better than in my last letter. The summer to be ending with a bang. not with a whimper. Perhaps it will revive. You will return to a brownish Ingihiterra. you know what Durer said about Germany in Venice?. 'Oh how cold it will be after the sunshine'.

        I have been typing out my notes for my first lecture on Tuesday. I have found a mistake in Johnson's Flemish^^ syllabus: he says Vermeer influenced Metsu whereas in fact M foreshadowed V.  De Groot points this out in his great work.   has not   Johnson read this?. It was printed 40 years ago.

       i don't think that this Paris cafe prices are too high but rather that/students are not in Paris now and that makes a big difference.

        Your dress, the Minerva one does sound char-ming. how I look forward to seeing it. by the way, my trousers are not yet dyed. I wasted a lot of timetrying to find a cleaner with pastel shades^^^
      and now the best of them is full up and not dying men's things. (I think they'll have to be nigger.)
      Other colors are for export - Fawn and so on.

      Your account of Pallas and Apollo side by side was delightful. And your sight of space composition in the life' must have been thrilling. The huge pink shell sounds both Umbrian and like the shell from which Venus stepped.
       When we meet next I shall be very excited to hear if this feast of painting has given you any especial ideas for new paintings. Of course you were in Italy before but this trip is altogether more professional. Will Sienese mannerism be apparent in your draughtmanship I wonder?. There is so much to talk about. I long for to see you.
      I long for you

      Dearest Sylvia,
      I had to stop my last letter before I intended to because I discovered Saturday morning when I should have finished it that the V and A library is closing for a week, and that work I intended to do on Monday had to be done on Saturday.  So I experienced yet more memories of you yesterday when I had lunch in that milk bar at South Kensington where we have been, it's called 'Nic's', I'm afraid.  I was sorry not to be able to get a seat where we had been.  The weather is no better than in my last letter.  The Summer seems to be ending with a bang.  Not with a whimper.  Perhaps it will revive.  You will return to a brownish Inghihterra.  You know what Durer said about Germany in Venice?  'Oh how cold it will be after the sunshine'.

      I have been typing out my notes for my first lecture on Tuesday.  I have found a mistake in Johnson's Flemish & Dutch syllabus:  he says Vermeer influenced Motsu whereas in fact M foreshadowed V.  De Groot points this out in his great work.  Has not Johnson read this?  It was printed 40 years ago.

      I don't think that the Paris cafe prices are too high but rather that students are not in Paris now and that makes a big difference.

      Your dress, the Minerva one, does sound charming.  How I look forward to seeing it.  By the way, my trousers are not yet dyed.  I wasted a lot of time trying to find a cleaner with pastel shades at his disposal and now the best of them is full up and not dying men's things.  (I think they'll have to be nigger.)

      Your account of Pallas and Apollo, side by side was delightful.  And your sight of space composition in the life must have been thrilling.  The huge pink shell sounds both Umbrian and like the shell from which Venus stepped.
