      I hope you had a pleasant
      evening with your family, and
      above all that you did not tire
      yourself and that your lecture
      went well. You didn't ans-

      Dearest Lawrence
      How nice to hear from us again - it seems so long- I had a strange dream last night of longing and fear - I dreamt Kathy was going to marry!
      I am interested to hear about the book-case and shall look forward to seeing it in situ.
      I hope you had a pleasant evening with your family - and above all that you did not tire yourself and that your lecture went well. You didn't answer my query about Charles and your book. I remember the Spinello Arctino very well I am glad you are able to use Autal - I find him most fascinating - I must read some
