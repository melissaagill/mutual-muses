      Dearest Lawrence,
      I adore you, and hope your
      rest at Wimbledon has done you good
      and that my Lion is quite recovered.
      I arrived safely and read quite
      a bit of George! I found a wee letter from my paper inclosing "Stills"
      from a cine camera of him [unclear]ahoy!!
      [/unclear]
      I had seen them already. I wonder if you asked to see the enlargement
      of the snap of yourself?
      I was discussing with Tiny the
      question of noise in American Cinemas
      of course she said that she had not
      been to the cinema since 1933 (in
      New York) she said there were extremely
      sumptuous, like palaces
      or cathedrals, with boudoirs, cafes
      coffee rooms, paper rooms, enormous
      staircases - etc. Tiny thinks that
      the machines mentioned in "W.O"
      must be in the foyer. of course

      Pett 10.9.52
      Dearest Lawrence
      I adore you, and hope your rest at Wimbledon has done you good and that my Lion is quite recovered.
      I arrived safely and read quite a bit of George! I found a nice letter from my paper inclosing "stills" from a cine camera of [unclear]his diary[/unclear]! I had seen them already. I wonder if you asked to see the enlargements of the snap of yourself?
      I was discussing with Tiny the question of noise in American cinemas of course she said that she had not been to a cinemal since 1933 (in New York) She said these were extremely sumptious, like palaces or cathedrals, with boudoirs, cafes, coffee rooms, paper rooms, enormous staircases - etc. Tiny thinks that the machines mentioned in "W.O." must be in the foyer. Of course
