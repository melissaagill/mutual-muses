      and [unclear]damning[/unclear] children's books of the
      character of yours. This is a pleasure
      [unclear]andies[/unclear] you have taught me, Minerva.
      Abruptly I remember you one evening
      in [unclear]Ceffand's[/unclear] room, when the Stewarts
      were there. You had on that short dress and
      firmly kept your knees together and your
      eyes absolutely blazed as you got
      slightly tight. I cannot go on writ-
      ing down delicious memories of you
      and you must take farther lovage
      for granted. But - I love you, I
      love you. I miss you so much. Sylvia.
      Alas, my writing gets no clearer but I
      hope that any love is not abused by this
      strange hand. I shall print it, he says
      dimmly: I LOVE YOU. There, now there
      can be no mistaking it. Dearest.
      I have heard of a room which may be
      vacant about September: its between
      Hammersmith and Richmond. Not so im-
      material as it sounds. I shall have
      fuller information in a day or two I
      hope. Dandylion will set up on his own,
      yet, though the prospect of earning en-
      ough to live properly seems to him fab-
      ulous and remote. Its in every letter
      I have written recently it is time to go
      to sleep. I shall finish tomorrow.
