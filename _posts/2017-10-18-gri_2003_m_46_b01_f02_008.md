      To take the analogy further, as I hope do in a poem I'm thinking about now, it can stand for the contrast of being with you & being without you.  I want a [unclear]mean[/unclear] the two images more [unclear]Doroughs[/unclear] into went I've already written.  OWLS AND ROSES
      Carter's farm slumps into
      picturesque decay
      Barns are hollowed by wind
      mud rolls about the farm yard
      where some machines are wrecked.

      Painters visit here
      in polite weather or not
      attracted as [unclear]davgs[/unclear]
      Tealeaves in a skull
      recalling not [unclear]mediding[/unclear] journeys

      The poem just occurred to me,  It's very light of course.  I suddenly remember Vincent lines at his most rugged, most peed in the wind pose, and felt slightly irritated by it.

      I hope you are avoiding too much work and for heaven's sake don't take the kitchen too seriously.

      To take the analogy further, as I hope [unclear]to be[/unclear]
      in a poem I'm thinking about now, it can
      stand for the contrast of being with you
      being without you.  I want to weave the [unclear]love[/unclear]
      images more [unclear]thoroughly[/unclear] into what I've al-
      ready written.  OWLS AND ROSES.

      [unclear]Lanter's[/unclear] Farm slumps into
      Picturesque decay
      [unclear]Calm[/unclear] followed by wind
      Mud walls about the farm yard
      where some machines are [unclear]wrecked[/unclear]

      attracted as [unclear]though[/unclear]
      [unclear]Tealeaves[/unclear] in a [unclear]stall[/unclear]
      Recalling not predicting journeys

      The poem just occurred to me.  [unclear]It's[/unclear] very
      [unclear]light[/unclear] of course.  I suddenly remember
      Vincent Lines at his most rugged, most
      [unclear]proud[/unclear] in the wind rose, and
      felt slightly irritated [unclear]by[/unclear] it.

      I hope you are avoiding too much
      [unclear]work[/unclear] and for heavens' sake don't take
      the [unclear]kitchen[/unclear] too seriously.
