      Miss Sylvia Sleigh,
      Rectory Lodge,
      Pett,
      Nr. Hastings, Sussex
      February 17th., 1953
      Dear Sylvia Sleigh,
      Thank you for your letter received yesterday morning. I am very sorry indeed about the cards. I must accept the entire blame for the delay (it was an unfortunate misunderstanding between myself and our printer) I can only hope that the emergency measures have partially saved the day.
      Normally we do not find it necessary to proof a catalogue for the reason that there is hardly ever the time to do it and we like to try and get the numbers in right sequence. In view, however, of the narrow margin between February and March shows I have abandoned the idea of attempting a sequence and the catalogue is already in the printer's hands for proofing. He would like to know however, if you wish the catalogue to be printed in "Bondi" (as your card) or the Gill type, examples of which you have seen here. If you will let me know by return the answer to this question the catalogue shall be proofed forthwith. Incidentally for it s final colour I suggest the orange type on a green paper.
      The "New Statesman" rate for classified advertisements is 3/6d. per line (minimum 3 lines). Let me know your wishes in this respect when I see  you on Thursday.
      All good wishes,
      yours sincerely,
      O.MICHAEL CHASE
