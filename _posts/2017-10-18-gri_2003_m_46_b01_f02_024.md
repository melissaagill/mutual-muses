      SUNDAY
      I dreamt of you [unclear]easeriget[/unclear]. We were in a public place - a theatre - you showing
      people their places, managing only to kiss me or hold my hand in des-
      perate fragments. We had been separated. I wanted to keep you with me.
      That, quite exactly, was the dream.
      Although i have made a few rates for poems about Paris I find that
      it is easier to write to you and about you than choose a subject b-
      yond love. There is a necessity about you as muse as well as subject: I
      said so some time ago, as a conceit, and find that circumstances endorse
      it.
      I wish you had been with me in the zoo of the Jardin des Plantes
      the other day. Some beautiful peacocks there had opened their tails making
      a waterfall that fell upwards. One of them turned exposing the little

      Obviously cages could not be [unclear]devised[/unclear] to hold them. The patron of
      owls rescues them. Nor was there a blue satyr.
      The sun is out again this morning after a slow start. Water is

      I can see myself in 2 of the 4 mirrors with which even our small

      SUNDAY

      I dreamt of you last night. We were in a public place - a theatre - you showing people to their places, managing only to [unclear]kiss me as hold my hand issdes verate fragments.[/unclear] I wanted to help you [unclear]???[/unclear] That, quite exactly, was the dream.

      Although I have made a few notes for poems about Paris I find that it is easier to write to you and about you than choose a subject beyond love. There is a necessity about you as muse as well as subject: I said so sometime ago as a conceit, but find that circumstances endorse it.

      I wish you had been with me in the zoo of the Jardin des Plantes the other day. Some beautiful  peacocks there had opened their tails making a waterfall that fell upwards. One of them turned exposing the little machine that supports the fan. But otherwise I was oppressed by the air of tormented claustrophobia you find in zoos. There were no owls, obviously cages could not be devised to hold them. The patron of owls rescued them. None was there, blue satyr.

      The sun is out again this morning after a slow start. Water is running rapidly through the gutters. The tap is dripping. I'm half dressed. I can see myself in 2 of the 4 mirrors with which even our small room is supplied. French motor horns are wildly sounding. Albert is on the balcony singing tunelessly.

      Pett must be very lonely just now. I hope that your portrait of the [unclear]Deme[/unclear] girl is satisfactory and I am interested to know how you get on with her. [unclear]???[/unclear] how Michael feels about her now. I hope Clifford is more cheerful now than he appeared to be a week or so ago. I imagine he will be a little busier than usual as it is Easter. I hope he conveys elaborate [unclear]Jeriatical /unclear] instruction to his sheep. The ambivalent joys of love and sadism and so on. What Easter means to us.

      What Easter means to me is missing you.

      I love you
      Lawrence
