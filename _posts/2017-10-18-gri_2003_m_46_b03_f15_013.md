      The news @ "Attrene" is pleasing - I hope the name brings the fortune that it should!
      My shoes arrived almost at once - and I am delighted with them. I'm so sorry not to have mentioned them before. I am delighted too that you have found one garden pool.
      I must go to bed now for I am very tired - Aunt Margaret left after lunch - I enjoyed her visit she is a dear. And as I have been sleeping well my tiredness is not exhaustion!
      I am so glad you are working a Hogarth. Can you afford to have me on Friday do you think? I have a lecture at Fairlight on Dec. 6th I hope this will not prove inconvenient!
      I love you my dearest and think of you continually - my love I love you
