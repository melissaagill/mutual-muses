      Tuesday Blackheath

      Dearest Sylvia,

      Forgive my not writing yesterday. I had hoped to and carried writing materials in my briefcase but apart from to lectures I had to review the Walton, see my father, visit a photographers about the Chick exhibition, and go to the bank, and pick up Paul's hold all, and quite literally I had not a moment. I'm so sorry. I shall send off today the tea, return the ration books, and post The Eagle and Hillyard.

      Thank you for your latest delightful letter, which contains such good news about your paintings. The garden landscape almost finished - I am astounded at your vigour. Congratulations. I hope the weather will permit you to finish 'my' view soon.

      Yes, to answer your letter, I think I have solved D.O.A. I got up early yesterday and finished typing it before breakfast in case anybody in France is interested in it. I won't paraphrase my argument but show you the whole article when I come. Orphee? I'd love to write on it but I must see it again.

      I met Gainsborough accidentally yesterday and told him to keep me in mind when he starts covering films in Art News. I told him about The Third Man. Talking of Gainsborough reminds me I have just finished the Walton Review (it is 10.00) and must be off shortly to do the last-minute shopping and be at the gallery by 3.00 for my Titian lecture. The Walton show is a delight but I did not meet anybody there. I must certainly write about Walton in book ii.

      There are so may things I would like to write about at length but I really reel somewhat anxious about getting everything done today so forgive me, my darling, if I stop now, so soon in this letter, but at my back I hear... I will write you at length and lovingly from France. I shall write you at stages all along my journey tomorrow and remember when we made the journey last year. I am sure to write some poems. Do paint my rose, my so gifted painter, my love, my Muse, and tell me all about your pictures. I cannot tell you how happy your successful work makes me. I love you, love you, love you, and will write amply tomorrow.

      I love you
      Laurence

      P.S. I have your pictures from [unclear][/unclear] AIA.

    clean_transcription: '[12-150]<br/>Tuesday Blackheath<br/>Dearest Sylvia,<br/>Forgive
      my not writing yesterday. I had hoped to and carried writing materials about
      in my briefcase but apart from two lectures I had to review the Walton, see
      my father, visit a photographer about the Chick exhibition, and go to the bank,
      and pick up Paul''s hold all, and quite literally I had not a moment. I''m so
      sorry. I shall send off today the tea, return the ration books, and post the
      Eagle and Hillyard.<br/>Thank you for your latest delightful letter, which contains
      such good news about your paintings. The garden landscape almost finished -
      I am astounded at your vigour. Congratulations. I hope the weather will permit
      you to finish ''my'' view soon.<br/>Yes, to your letter, I think I have solved
      D.O.A. I got up early yesterday and finished typing it before breakfast in case
      anybody in France is interested in it. I won''t paraphrase my argument but show
      you the whole article when I come. Orphee? I''d love to write on it but I must
      see it again.<br/>I met Gainsborough accidentally yesterday and told him to
      keep me in mind when he starts covering films in Art News. I told him about
      The Third Man. Talking of Gainsborough reminds me I have just finished the Walton
      review (it is 10.00) and must be off shortly to do the last-minute shopping
      and be at the gallery by 3.00 for my Titian lecture. The Walton show is a delight
      but I did not meet anybody there. I must certainly write about Walton in book
      ii.<br/>There are so many things I would like to write about at length but I
      really feel somewhat anxious about getting everything done today so forgive
      me, my darling, if I stop now, so soon in this letter, but at my back I hear
      .... I wil lwrite you at length and lovingly from France. I shall write at stages
      all along the journey tomorrow and remember when we made the journey last year.
      I am sure to write some poems. Do paint my rose, my so gifted painter, my love,
      my Muse, and tell me all about your pictures. I cannot tell you how happy your
      successful work makes me. I love you, I love you, love you, and will write amply
      tomorrow.<br/>I love you <br/>Lawrence<br/>P.S. I have your pictures from the
      AIA'
