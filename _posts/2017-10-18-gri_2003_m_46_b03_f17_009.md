      Pett
      Dearest Lawrence
      I hope that this reaches you in time and of course I hope that all your lectures are a great success - especially the one on Renoir at Barningham - also I'm longing to hear about Ely - the Cathedral and how the boys respond. I think lecturing to children of that age can be very satisfactory - and may awaken an interest in the subject which will last.
      I am delighted to hear that Vudges designs are so good - that will be an addition to an already authoritative exhibition.
      No doubt your muse will be full [unclear]flight[/unclear] with you on your travels and you will write a lot of your proposed topographical poems. I hope you have managed comfortably to get all your work done.
      I do not know if Sitvan has any Northern Influence - perhaps Durce
