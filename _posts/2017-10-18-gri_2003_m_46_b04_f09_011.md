      I envy you C's talk on the Sitwells, I am sure it was absolutely marvellous. Your mention of Mr Hanley's discourse reminds me of William Gaunt. Happily he has put down his ramblings. May I give you a short quotation, which I find absolutely enigmatic (though, of course, the Gertrude Stein echoes predispose one to like it):

      Morris did not found the Arts and Crafts movement, though it is sometimes taken for granted that he did and he contributed help to its efforts. Was it not what he had intended? It was -and yet it was not. That others should, as he did, take a pride in the individual work of the hand, that was what he could have wished.

      As it is Sunday I dare not leave it too late in the afternoon to post this letter. So before going to the post, here is a poem, only one short one for the moment, I'm afraid, but still it's a start.

      Can epiphanies be blue,
      Can they have five points,
      To turn in the night's wards,
      Do they have two heads, one eye?

      Does it happen in Italy,
      Is there music or a calm,
      Do you know it when
      Wings kidnap sleeping girls?

      But I'm the epiphany
      Silently-spoke the rose: it's me
      The glass communicated,
      Where your love has been.

      The electric bulb
      Rushed outwards till it was
      A tree whose branches filled
      The room, the world.

      Oh I long to see you again. To think I have another week to wait. Dearest love, this prolonged absense disrupts equilibrium, opens old doors in dreams, blots paper waiting for poems. How I love you, my life, dearest beauty,

      I love you I love you
      Lawrence

      I envy you C's talk on the Sitwells, I am sure it was ab-

      Morris did not found the Arts and Crafts movement, though
      it is sometiems taken for granted that he did and he con-

      It was--and et it was not.  That others should, as he did,
      take a pride in the individual work of the hand, that was

      As it is Sunday I dare not leave it too late in the

      here is a poem, only one short one for the moment, I'm afraid,

      CAn epiphanies be blue,
      Can they have five points
      To turn in the night's wards,
      Do they have two heads, one eye?
      Does it happen in Italy,
      Is there music or a calm,
      Do yu know it when
      Wings kidnap sleeping girls?
      But I'm the epiphany
      Silently-spoke the rose:  it's me
      The glass communicated,
      Where your love has been.
      The electric bulb
      Rushed outwards till it was
      A tree whose branches filled
      The room, the world.
      Oh I long to see you again.  To think I have another week
      to wait.  Dearest love, this prolonged absence disrupts equi-
      librium, opens old doors in dreams, blots paper waiting for
