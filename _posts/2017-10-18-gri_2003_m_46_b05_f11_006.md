      FROM TRAJAN'S COLUMN DOWN

      A Book of Scripts. By Alfred Fairbank. (Penguin Books. 4s.)
      Sweet Roman Hand. By Wilfred Blunt. (James Barris. 15s.)
      Written By Hand. By Aubrey West. (Allen and Unwin. 7s. 6d.)
      Good Handwriting and How to [unclear]Acquire[/unclear] It. By John O. Tarr. (Phoenix House Ltd. 5s.)

      Carolingian minuscule was developed during the revival of
      learning associated with Charlemagne.  It was a hand of great
      clarity, free of cursive tendencies - though 'lower case'.  It
      developed into the Gothic Script of progressive heaviness and
      angularity.  Humanists of the 15th century rediscovered the
      pre-Gothic Carolingian minuscule: it was imitated, first in
      Florence, then in Rome, where it was named [unclear]Cancelleresee[/unclear].
      The cursive form of cancelleresea is what we mean by Chancery
      and Italic.  The four books reviewed here re-
      commend an italic revival.
      [unclear]Rr[/unclear] Alfred Fairbank's [unclear]Eing[/unclear] Penguin A Book of Scripts was
      published in 1949 and this year a third edition has appeared.
      Penguin Books Ltd. do not bother themselves with small editions.
      We can be certain that the editions were large and that a great
      many interested readers must have seen the book.  The question
      arises then, who is going to read the more expensive books of
      Mr. Blunt and Mr. West?  So importent is Mr. Fairbank's position
      in the field of modern handwriting that both writers have gone
      over the same ground with Fairbank with the same purpose.  Excellent as Mr
      Fairbank's book is, it is to be hoped that it will not stifle
      independence among his supporters.
      The pattern of the arguement runs like this (it is also
      found in the short historical section of Mr Tarr's book):

      FROM TRAJAN'S COLUMN DOWN

      A Book of Scripts. By Alfred Fairbank. (Penguin Books. 4s.)
      Sweet Roman Hand. By Wilfred Blunt. (James Barris. 15s.)
      Written By Hand. By Audrey West. (Allen and Unwin. 7s. 6d.)
      Good Handwriting and How to Acquire it. By John O. Tarr.
      (Phoenix House Ltd. 6s.)

      Carolingian minuscule was developed during the revival of
      learning associated with Charlemagne. It was a hand of great
      clarity, free of cursive tendencies - though 'lower case'. It
      developed into the Gothic Script of progressive heaviness and
      angularity. Humanists of the 15th century rediscovered the
      pre-Gothic Carolingian minuscule: it was imitated, first in
      Florence, then in Rome, where it was named Cancelleresea.
      The cursive for the Cancelleresea is what we mean by Chancery
      and Italic. The four books reviewed here re-
      commend an italic revival.)
      Mr. Alfred Fairbank's King Penguin A Book of Scripts was
      published in 1949 and this year a third edition has appeared.
      Penguin Books Ltd. do not bother themselves with small editions.
      We can be certain that the editions were large and that a great
      many interested readers must have seen the book. The question
      arises then, who is going to read the more expensive books of
      Mr. Blunt and Mr. West? So important is Mr. Fairbank's position
      in the field of modern handwriting that both writers have gone
      over the same ground as Mr. Fairbanks with the same purpose. Excellent as Mr.
      Fairbank's book is, it is to be hoped that it will not stifle
      independence among his supporters.
      The pattern of the argument runs like this (it is also
      found in the short historical section of Mr. Tarr's book):
