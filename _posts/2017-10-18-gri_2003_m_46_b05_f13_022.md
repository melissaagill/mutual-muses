      B waiting July to be awakened
      by love. I begin to fear
      that my darling [unclear]son[/unclear], lacks
      both - I still hope - but I fear - and if I am
      unduly hopeful what chance
      is there for us?  For as to
      features this is the best time
      of the year and if you are
      in a difficult position now
      how will it be in the summer.
      I would keep [unclear]you[/unclear] but my
      own position is far too precarious
      and were I to work for you
      my bitterness would be such as
      to poison any love. If
      you do not get a job in about
      a month I think you had
      better give [unclear]Mrs. Harrison[/unclear]
      notice and go back home
      where your lectures will
      keep you in pocket money -
      it would be a sad defeat
      or reversion to childhood

      will it be in the summer.<br/>I would keep you but my<br/>own position is far
      too precarious<br/>and were I to work for you<br/>my bitterness would be such
      as<br/>to poison any love. If<br/>you do not get a job in about<br/>a month
      I think you had<br/>better give out Harrison<br/>hotel and go back home<br/>where
      your lectures will<br/>keep you in pocket money -<br/>it would be a sad defeat<br/>an
      reverson to childhood
