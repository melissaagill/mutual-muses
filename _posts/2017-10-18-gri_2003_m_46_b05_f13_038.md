      Pett

      Dearest Lawrence,
      A note to say that Mrs.
      Blackwell rang up this morning
      to say Wednesday at lunch
      time would suit her better
      after all!  So we are as
      we were.  I shall come up
      to Charing X with Clifford
      and Marjorie by the 2.10,
      arriving 3.58.  So sorry
      to make such a middle--not
      my fault.  Please will you bring
      the picture will and the double
      "X" hook.
      I hope that your Birmingham
      lecture goes well.  I am think-
      ing of you!  as I work like
      mad on my picture.
      I am longing to see you.
      I love you.
      Sylvia
