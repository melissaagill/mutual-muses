      S.E.A.
      SOCIETY FOR EDUCATION IN ART - 17 VAUXHALL BRIDGE RD S.W.1
      Bank Holiday), by the Centripetal (Quartet). The centripetal form has, of course, no raison d'etre whatever as far as form goes. Le Ronde is, I imagine, horizontal: we must see it next week at the Rex. I look forward to taking you. I will tell you more about other terms when we meet.
      I take it that we shall meet on Monday. I leave the time and place (Paddington presumably) to you and I will meet you where and when you say. I hope to see Mrs Carlisle at the Arts Council in the early morning so I shall be in town; but, as you know, I would meet you in any case.
