      I wonder if Ithel came?  It would be more restful with Paul only!  But Ithel
      would be amusing, and no doubt would enjoy the two of you!  We had a pleasant
      drive here only we were rather too tired to enjoy it fully - how different it
      was from the time that we left it - still quite stark.  Tiny and Clifford were
      waiting for us, and Tiny had a delicious cold meal which was most welcome.  It
      was wonderful to dance again - and above all with you - I think we can easily
      go to a tea or coffee(!) dance here - I will find out about them.  I am delighted

      hope you had a pleasant Sunday, I wonder if Ethel came? It would be more restful
      with Paul only! But Ethel would be amusing, and no doubt would enjoy the two
      of you!<br/><br/>We had a pleasant drive here only we were rather too tired
      to enjoy it fully--how different it was from the time that we left it, still
      quite stark. Tiny and Clifford were waiting for us, and Tiny had a delicious
      cold meal which was most welcome.<br/><br/>It was wonderful to dance again,
      and above all with you. I think we can easily go to a tea or coffee (!) dance
      here. I will find out about them.<br/><br/>I am delighted to hear about
