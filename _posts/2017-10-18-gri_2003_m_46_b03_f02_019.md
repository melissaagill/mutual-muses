           I will tell you first about the lecture.  The resist-
      ance I had expected I did not encounter and, enboldened,
      I even ventured a little way onto psycho-analyticl
      interpretation - of one Ernst and one Miro.  I read them
      [unclear]Trava's[/unclear] lion Tamer, automatic texts by Picasso, poems by
      [unclear]Peret[/unclear], [unclear]Eluard[/unclear], and Miro himself.  They honestly seemed
      persuaded when I said - orthodox surrealism - that every-
      body could be a surrealist - Mrs Jarvis even admitting
      she could write such poems if she tried to.   The husband of one
      of the women came and seemed himself interested in
      what was going on: in the discussion when I mentioned
      the resistance surrealism often aroused he compared
      it to (super-ego) laws about bathing, &c.  I took along
      many books and did not leave until almost 10 o'clock.
      I had then admiring Alice [unclear]Paales[/unclear], Esteban [unclear]Frances[/unclear], as well
      as the more familiar earlier surrealists.  It is curious
      how swiftly they respond to colour.  One woman bro-
      ught along some [unclear]Harisons[/unclear] with surreal illustrations to
      pass about - which was very kind, I thought.
           On the way -- actually at [unclear]Morden[/unclear] -- I listened for
      a time to an election meeting (a conservative) : it was a
      curious occasion and one I was fascinated by.  The sky
      was getting appreciably darker & great clouds were rear-

      23.11.1950
      Dearest Sylvia
      I will tell you first about the lecture. The resistance I had expected I did not encounter and, emboldened, I even ventured a little way into psych-analytical interpretations of one Ernst and one Miro. I read them [unclear][/unclear] lion [unclear][/unclear], automatic  texts by Picasso, poems by Peret, Eluard and Miro himself. They honestly seemed persuaded when I said - orthodox surrealism - that everybody could be a surrealist - Mrs Jarvis even admitted she could write such poems if she tried to. The husband of one of the women came and seemed himself interested in what was going on: in the discussion when I mentioned the resistance surrealism often aroused he compared it to  (super-ego) laws about bathing, &c. I took along many books and did not leave until about 10 o'clock. I had them admiring, Alice [unclear]Paaless[/unclear], Estoban [unclear][/unclear], as well as the more familiar earlier surrealists. It is curious how swiftly they respond to colour. One woman brought along some [unclear]Harisons/unclear]  with surreal illustrations to pass about - which was very kind, I thought.
      On the way - actually at Morden - I listened for a time to an election meeting (a conservative): it was a curious occasion and one I was fascinated by. The sky getting appreciably darker & great clouds were seen way up from the horizon - as from a burning city. Great pink and orange 'flowers' of neon bloomed brighter as it
