      I love you so much Sylvia and I long for Monday. I can imagine the last few minutes in the train: I al-
      ways think Warrior Square is going to be my station.

      My love for you is as strong as it has ever been and confidence in our future is stronger than ever. I know the difficulties but I believe we can overcome them.

      Your signature in today's letters gives me such delight - your S looping about the word 'you' (me) just as your arms do about my neck or as your love does to me every moment. It is a delicious device and I adore it -

      Oh, Sylvia, I love you,
