      profound painting.
      Wally has a 'lodger' - named Paul, I don't know his other name - a South African who is a sculptor. I do not know what his work is like but he is very intelligent and we had a long discussion about mathematics and abstract painting. This made my Wimbledon visit more tolerable.
      How are all your flowers at Pett? In particular your geraniums? I am sure that seeing you again all will revive and grow strongly, dir-ecting their open eyes to you, as to the sun. The whole garden will be suffused with a will to life and everything will tremble as though
