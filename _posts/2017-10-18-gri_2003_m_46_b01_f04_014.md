      \n\nMany thanks for your letter. The critic in me more than the poet was appealed

      quotation is from a group of prose-poems that I wrote two summers ago and it
      is typical of my old attitude which also produces the Atumn poem you already

      you, even the slightest of them, and you have them all, you will see the difference,

      have no need for anxiety at all. Really my only fear is that my devotion may
      become boring. \n\nMy chances of passing the exam can be gauged by the fact

      [19-5-48] Wednesday 11 Mansel Road Wimbledon

      Dearest Sylvia:

      Many thanks for your letter.  The critic in me more than the poet was appealed to by your polemics.  The only bit that seems to me answerable is about your insecurity.  Your feeling of insecurity, I should say, and prefer to say.

      'So precarious is the intimacy which suspends solitude, that when talking to a dwarf whom I encountered in the deserted foyer of a derelict hotel, we decided to collaborate on a study of the erotic fallacy.  Like a rope, linking two ocean liners steaming on parallel courses, which will snap at the slightest divergence of either vessel, is the bond of what is popularly called love'.

      Now that quotation is from a group of prose-poems that I wrote two summers ago and it is typical of my old attitude which also produced the Autumn poem you already know.  If you compare it with any of the poems I have written since I have loved you, even the slightest of them, and you have them all, you will see the difference, the re-orientation you have caused.  You must see that where I am concerned you have no need for anxiety at all.  Really my only fear is that my devotion may become boring.

      My chances of passing the exam can be gauged by the fact that I have not heard of Stanislas' works at Nancy.  However I shall console myself by writing poems in the exam.  About a fellow student.

      I must assure you that your view of Mother's attitude toward me is very wrong and that it was necessary to get you of of mother's mind quickly.  From Molly I heard there is even possibility of disinheritance if anthing serious ...&c.

      I enjoyed the lecture yesterday.  That may mean something.

      I will meet you at the bus station, Friday.

      I love you

      Lawrence

      called love'.\n\nNow that quotation is from a group of prose-poems that I\nwrote
      two summers ago and it is typical of my old attitude\nwhich also produced the

      have written since\nI have loved you, even the slightest of them, and you have\nthem

      my only fear\nis that my devotion become boring.\n\n       My chances of passing
