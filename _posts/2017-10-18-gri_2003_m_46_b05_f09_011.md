      Dearest Sylvia,
      I see that Norman Haire is dead. I am very sorry
      indeed, tho' not surprised in view of C's apprehension. He
      was only 60: what a shame it is.
      What is the position of my lecture now? Will it take
      place as arranged? I f it does not would C still like
      my article? If he needs it he shall have it, as the Journ-
      al is so far advanced - or, possibly, an obituary will take
      up the remaining space.
      Poor George Savage. I am glad you were able to bring him
      'instant relief' as the advertisements say. How did The First
      Meal In The New House go, on the electric cooker? You are
      an expert on those machines - I hope Beryl soon learns to
      handle it.
      I have almost finished a poem called Aphoristic Remarks on
      Maladaptations of Giants: the 1st part by of the title was suggested by
      a Ferengi article, the latter part by some giants who figure in
      an abstract play by Kardinski (WASSILY, of course). But of course , the poem is about
      something else. I will send it tomorrow.
      How did you like the Kensington Gallery cards this month - I
      mean the 'one-man show card? I like your projected card more -
      I am reading some of Hardy's poems 'Times Laughing Stocks'
      is thenot un- typical title.
      I had a long talk with Molly on the 'phone yesterday: she is
      rather better than she was when I gave you news of her the other
      day. After a nose bleed she felt better.
      Your lion is eating and sleeping well so his glands will
      soon be down.Today I must read the later chapters of Finley's
      Turner for a lectureon T's  late work.
      Oh I miss you desperately. I am so impatient for the

      14th September '52
      Dearest Sylvia,
      I see that Norman Haire is dead. I am very sorry indeed, tho' not surprised in view of C's apprehension. He was only 60: what a shame it is.
      What is the position of my lecture now? Will it take place as arranged? If it does not would C still like my article? If he needs it he shall have it, as the Journal is so far advanced. Or, possibly, an obituary will take up the remaining space.
      Poor George Savage. I am glad you were able to bring him 'instant relief' as the advertisements say. How did The First Meal in The New House go, on the electric cooker? You are an expert on those machines - I hope Beryl soon learns to handle it.
      I have almost finished a poem called Apheristic Remarks on Maladaptation of Giants: the ist part of the title was suggested by a Ferenczi article, the latter part by some giants who figure in an abstract play by Kardinski WASSILT, of course. But of course, the poem is about something else. I will send it tomorrow.
      How did you like the Kensington Gallery card this month - I mean the "one-man show card? I like your projected card more.
      I am reading some of Mandy's poems 'Ties Laughing Stocks' is the not un-typical title.
      I had a long talk with Molly on the 'phone yesterday: she is rather better than she was when I gave you news of her the other day. After a nose bleed she felt better.
      Your lion is eating and sleeping well so his glands will soon be down. Today I must read the later chapters of Finley's Turner for a lecture on T's late work.
      Oh I miss you desperately. I am so impatient for the 25th September. I love you so dearly. Adore you.
