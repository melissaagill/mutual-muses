      you.  I am charmed that you remember it.  Oh, dearest, I love you so.  I am full of love for you.  Your beauty is in my heart and mind all the time.  Say, you love me.

      Do you remember one of my very first poems I wrote for you:  'Goodbye the mists above Firelight' and, then,

      Our history is forgotten
      But you Minerva recoup
      Those Southern Voyages
      Which I may also follow

      They seem appropriate again.  Then I remembered a more recent sonnet:

      The future is a vase that twas shall turn
      To find our flowers and dances going on.

      And the following sonnet is the result of recalling these in the light of the present situation:

      The future is a trip to Italy :
      Do not return, my traveller, to the past,
      Glacial, unconfident, but rest
      In the creative Southern country.

      From there embark with me for Cythera
      Where vines grow over the painter's easel
      ( As on the ship which came at last to Naxos )
      And birds escort the lovely traveller.

      The shell whispers on the English sand:
      -Master the culture of the sun, accept
      The blood-red rings he puts upon your hand,
      The triumph of your beauty he expects.

      Welcome the journey and the sun's great dance inhibited no more by past allegiance.

      And the line brackets refers  to that lovely story of Bacchus in Bullfinch.

      I wonder what poetry Italy will produce.  I see Florence as a sestina with architectural terms repeated at the line ends.

      The post-office man looked up, flinching a little, and every-body at Blackheath send their love, in particular Dandylion who seems never to tire of saying, Sylvia, I love you,
      Lawrence

      you.  I am charmed that you remember it.  Oh, dearest, I
      love you so.  I am full of love for you.  Your beauty is
      in my heart and mind all the time.  Say, you love me.

      Do you remember one of the first poems I wrote for you:  'Goodby the mists above Fairlight' and, then,

      Our history is forgotten
      But you Minerva recoup
      Those Southern voyages
      Which I may also follow

      They seem appropriate again.  Then I remember a more re-
      cent sonnet:

      The future is a vase that we shall turn
      To find our flowers and dances going on.

      And the following sonnet is the result of recalling these
      in the light of the present situation:

      The future is a trip to Italy:
      Do not return, my traveller, to the past,
      Glacial, unconfident but rest
      In the creative Southern country.

      From there embark with me for Cythera
      Where vines grow over the painter's easel
      (As on the ship which came at last to Naxos)
      And birds escourt the lovely traveller.

      The shell whispers on the English sand:
      -Master the culture of the sun, accept
      The blood-red rings he puts upon your hand,
      The triumph of your beauty he expects.

      Welcome the journey and the sun's great dance
      Inhibited no more by past allegiance.

      And the line in brachets refers to that lovely story of Bacchus
      is Bullfinch.

      I wonder what poetry Italy will produce.  I see Florence as
      a sestina with architectural terms repeated at the line ends.
      I will write it in the afternoons while you paint.

      The post-office man looked up, flinching a little, when he
      read my telegram - LOVE HETTY. But Hetty, Lionel, and every-
      body at Blackheath send their love, in particular Dandylion
      who seems never to tire of saying, Sylvia, I love you,
