      day I have done the curtians
      and the post of the side-table
      I have done a little less than
      I had hoped as I had to
      get the lunch Marjorie still
      being in Littlehampton.
      I am trying hard to get
      all my odd jobs done so
      that I do not have an
      awful rush and feel tired
      on Monday.  I am so long-
      ing to see you.  I hope you
      can meet me.
      It was Desiree's 16th birthday
      today.  She came for her lesson as usual and then we had
      a glass of sherry together before
      lunch.  She went home of course.
      Among the books that Clifford
      is reviewing for Sex News in
      "The Unconscious Significance
      of Hair:  by Charles Berg
      who, Clifford says is very good.
      It is certainly most interesting
      and quite short.

    clean_transcription: day I have done the curtain and the post of the side-table
      I have done a little less than I had hoped as I had to get the lunch Marjorie
      still being in Littlehampton.<br/>I am trying hard to get all my odd jobs done
      so that I do not have an awful rush and feel tired on Monday - I am so longing
      to seen you I hope you can meet me.<br/>It was Desir'ee's 16th birthday to-day
      - she came for her lesson as usual and then we had a glass of sherry together
      before lunch. - She went home of course.<br/>Among the books that Clifford is
      reviewing for Sex News is "The Unconscious Significance of Hair" by Charles
      Berg who, Clifford says, is very good. It is certainly most interesting and
      quite short.
