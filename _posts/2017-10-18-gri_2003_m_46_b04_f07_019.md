      I have been reading Simone Weil on The Iliad: The Poem of Force and I  think I may expand my war films article a bit. She argues a man faced with death is a thing, in the existential sense: no liberty, no future. The killer is equally force's victim.

      Congratulations on finishing Erika's portrait: what I saw was delightful and I am impatient to see the finished thing. I am glad she liked it.

      John McHale heard from Madeleine that I was lecturing at the N.G. so came. He is doing some interesting abstractions now: subltler in colour, more complex, and with considerable glazing. Today I am meeting him and we are going to the private view of British Abstract Art at Gimpel.

      Thank you for the V and A cutting: I do not think it is quite right. It is not conceivable that I work in the Library as an assistant, for example. The age limit is 16-25.

      I have been reading Simone Weil on The
      Iliad:  The Poem of Force and I think I
      may expand my war films article a bit.
      She argues a man faced with death is a
      thing, in the existential sense:  no lib-
      erty, no future.  The killer is equal-
      ly force's victim.

      Congratulations on finishing Erika's
      portrait:  what I saw was delightful
      and I am impatient to see the finished
      thing.  I am glad she liked it.

      John McHale heard from Madeleine that I
      was lecturing at the N.G so came.  He
      is doing some interesting abstractions
      now:  subtler in color, more complex,
      and with considerable glazing.  Today
       I am meeting him and we are going to the
      private view of British Abstract Art at
      Gimpel.

      Thank you for the V and A cutting:  I do
      not think it is quite right.  It is not
      conceivable that I work in the library
      as an assistant, for example.  The age
      limit is 16-25.  The posts are for peop-
      le absolutely unfamiliar to the art-going
      public.  I fear I should risk exposing
      myself to a step down.

      I love you.  Give my love to the Woods.
      I will write them soon--and you again.
      I adore you,
