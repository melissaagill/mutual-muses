      I have asked him to send you two
      packets of envelopes for cards (48)
      if you should want more (!) let me know,
      I hope Chase will let me have my
      cards by next week for I want
      to send some off now.
           I hope that you are well again in
      spite of the dreadful weather. I
      am most peeved to be kept in bed
      now.  Tiny is most kind, and I
      much regret giving her the trouble.
           I have all but finished Blacker
      and will send it to you directly
      to look at the [unclear]Jim Thorpe[/unclear] Art Pottery
      pp. 406-414 by Dr. Dresser, and
      read the little bit.  Most amusing!
      By the way did you see that poor
      Sir Walter Smiles,[unclear]drowded[/unclear] in the
      Irish Channel was a son of the
      Samuel Smiles and his mother was
      the sister of Mme Beeton!  What
      a family tree!  Let me know all
      your news, my love, I love you
      Sylvia

      I have asked him to send you two packets of envelopes for cards (48) if you should want more (!) let me know, I hope Chase will let me hame my Cards by next week for I want to send some off now.
      I hope that you are well again inspite of the dreadful weather. I am most pleased to be kept in bed now. Tiny is most kind, and I much regret giving her the trouble.
      I have all but finished Blacker and will send it to you directly. Do look at the [unclear]Lin Hospe[/unclear] Art Pottery pp. 406 - 414 by Dr. Dresser and read the little pit, most amusing! By the way did you seee that Poor sir Walter Smiles, crowded in the Irish Channel was a son of the Samuel smiles and his mother was the sister of Mr Beeton! What a family tree! Let me know all your news, my love, I love you
