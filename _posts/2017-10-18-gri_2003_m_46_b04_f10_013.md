      Wimbledon

      Dearest Sylvia,

      I attempted to write a letter to you in the train yesterday but the movement was too wild.  When I reached London I phoned my parents & found that Father was in hospital and that he is having his operation on Monday (today).  Mother was alone - so here I am, staying at [unclear]Mamel [/unclear]Road for a couple of days.  Last night, of course, I went to visit father intending to return home.  But, if all goes well (& there is no reason to doubt it), I'll be home on Tuesday - I hope so for I find I am irritable & anxious without news of you (though your nice long letter at Thom's - which I got Friday - cheered me up & soothed me.

      My cold is bad: not only is it nasal, I have (imitative lion that I am) neuralgia on the right side of my face, too.  Too many journeys & changes of temperature have brought my cold back - beware, I'm afraid.  In a way Wimbledon is good for me as there are medicines (anodynes)  to rum (in hot milk).  But I want to get home once I've seen father tomorrow after the operation.  There are 2 lectures on Wednesday which I cannot shirk - N.G. at 2 and the Barnstead.

      Dias was a successful lecture, I think, & afterwards I stayed in a large C16th manor owned by the Rash's - the lady of whom is novelist Doreen Wallace & a Norfolk annalist.  We got on very well & she gave me one of her books & an invitation to return in the future.  She is a jolly talkative woman in her 50s - owns most of Wartlan (the village near Dias).

      My ideas for an Xmas short story:  3000 words & 250?  My parents have found a competition to that effect & suggested I try.  I thought I might go about the way Poe claims to have set to write The Raven.  (I must look up his analysis - tho' I must try to get a slightly different answer).

      Dearest Sylvia

      I attmepted to write a letter to you in the train yesterday but the movement was too wild. When I reached London I phoned my parents and found that Father was in hospital and that he is having his operation on Monday (today). Mother was alone- so here I am, staying at [unclear][/unclear] Road for a couple of days. Last night, of course, I went to visit father intending to return home. But, if all goes well (& there is no reason to doubt it), I'll be home on Tuesday- I hope so for I find I am irritable and anxious without news of you (though your nice long letter at Thom's- which I got Friday- cheered me up and soothed me).

      My cold is bad : not only is it [unclear][/unclear], I have (imitation lion that I am) neuralgia on the right side of my face, too. Too many journeys and changes of temperature have brought my cold back- beware, I'm afraid. In a way Wimbledon is good for me as there are medicines ([unclear]avondynes[/unclear] and [unclear][/unclear] (in hot milk.) But I want to get home once I've seen father tomorrow after the operation. There are 2 lectures on Wednesday, which I cannot shirk - N.S. at 2 and, then, Banstead.

      [unclear][/unclear] was a successful lecture, I think, and afterwards I stayed in a large Goth manor owned by the [unclear]Rask's[/unclear]- the lady of whom is novelist Doreen Wallace and a Norfolk annalist. We got on very well and she gave me one of her books and an invitation to return in the future. She is a jolly talkative woman in her 50s- owns most of [unclear]Worthan[/unclear] (the village near Dias). But she feels a bit isolated from original people: everybody's got something wrong- even when you're [unclear][/unclear] and own a village!
      My idea for a Xmas short story: 3000 words and 250 pounds? My parents have found a competition to that effect and suggested I try. I thought I might go about the way Poe claims to have set to write "The Raven". (I must look up his analysis- though I must try to get a slightly different answer.

      I will write again tomorow. I love you I love you.
