      31st December 1948 Wimbledon.
      Dearest Sylvia,
      At last the time approaches when our
      love can be expressed without the pain
      and frustration of separation and though
      I know the difficulty you must be feel-
      ing I promise you everything that love
      can do. How wonderful it will be to
      meet you and not have the Southern Rail-
      way, a sinister and threatening perspec-
      tive in the background. To talk to you
      and not fear for the night when you will
      be gone. Your love is heroic because
      you are leaving much that you love. I
      know this and I will keep you safe as
      well as adore you.
      Tomorrow is an anniversary of my vis-
      it to Pett, the first and the fifty-
      third. Oh dearest I love you more than
      I ever believed possible in those early
      days. Do you remember how, in the sum-
      mer, you said that our love had flower-
      ed mutually like two roses together.
      That poignant and lovely image is always
      in my thoughts - as often as you are and
      that, need I say it, is always. This
      New Year will begin our life together
      as the last New Year saw our love begin.
      Thank you for your loving letters which
      make me happy and seem to me a prelude
      of such happiness and love.

      without the pain and frustration of separation and though I know the difficulty
      you must be feeling I promise you everything that love can do. How wonderful
      it will be to meet you and not have the Southern Railway, sinister and threatening
      perspective in the background. To talk to you and not fear for the night when
      you will be gone. Your love is heroic because you are leaving much that you
      love. I know this and will keep you safe as well as adore you.<br/><br/>Tomorrow
      is an anniversary of my visit to Pett, the first and the fifty-third. Oh dearest
      I love you more than I ever believed possible in those early days. Do you remember
      how, in the summer, you said that our love had flowered mutually like two roses
      together. That poignant and lovely image is always  in my thoughts -as often
      as you are and that, need I say it, is always. This New Year will begin our
      life together as the last New Year saw our love begin.<br/><br/>Thank you for
      your loving letters which make me happy and seem to me a prelude of such happiness
      and love.

      31st December 1948 Wimbledon.

      Dearest Sylvia,

      At last the time approaches when our love can be expressed without the pain and frustration of separation and though I know the difficulty you must be feeling I promise you everything that love can do. How wonderful it will be to meet you and not have the Southern Railway, a sinister and threatening perspective in the background. To talk to you and not fear for the night when you will be gone. Your love is heroic because you are leaving much that you love. I know this and I will keep you safe as well as adore you.

      Tomorrow is an anniversary of my visit to Pett, the first and the fifty-third. Oh dearest I love you more than I ever believed possible in those early days. Do you remember how, in the summer, you said that our love had flowered mutually like two roses together. That poignant and lovely image is always in my thoughts - as often as you are and that, need I say it, is always. This New Year will begin our life together as the last New Year saw our love begin.

      Thank you for your loving letters which make me happy and seem to me a prelude of such happiness and love.
