      Here is her picture.  She is sitting at a desk which once belonged to the Empress Caterina which is of ebony supported by ormolu dolfins, and with a fishnet inlay of tulip wood - and ditto carved 'corks' at the corners.  Her inkstand is bronze supported by a beautifully modeled cat with a fishing rod - probably of Tuscan origins.  Lionel found it near Florence.  The fish in the glass case is a very rare one - which she caught herself off Corsica.  You see she is looking very thoughtful.  Of course she only writes in the evening or where the weather is not good enough to paint!
         I love you so much, my darling, it was so delightful to be with you again.  I long for our next meeting.
             I love you
                   Syliva
