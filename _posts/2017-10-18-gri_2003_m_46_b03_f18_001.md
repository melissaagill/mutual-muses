      Dearest Lawrence,

      I hope you had a comfortable journey and managed to do all the work that you needed. And that you had a pleasant audience and lodgings. I hope you had my letter. I had a comfortable journey - sitting in the front with my frame, my cold was very 'heavy' by then, but I felt all right.

      You will be sorry to hear that S.E.A. have not accepted either of my paintings. I felt bitterly disappointed about this on Monday - but being resilient and thinking continually of your good opinion and sensible attitude in the matter feel buoyant and creative again. I hope to do my cabbages tomorrow. Yesterday I did about 3 weeks laundry! To-day I am sitting for Michael - I think the portrait is going very well.

      In the 'view' at Christies I saw a most delightful Hayman wheel by colour tone and drawing I think

      Pett 1.11.50
      Dearest Lawrence,
      I hope you had a comfortable journey and managed to do all  the work you needed. And that you had a pleasant audience and lodgings - I hope you had my letter. I had a comfortable journey - sitting in the front with my frame, my cold was very "heavy' by then, but I felt all right.
      You will be sorry to  hear that S.E.A. have not accepted either of my paintings. I felt bitterly disappointed about this on Monday - but being resilient, and thinking continually of your good opinion and sensible attitude in the matter feel  buoyant and creative again. I hope to do my cabbages tomorrow. Yesterday I did about 3 weeks laundry! To-day I am sitting for Michael - I think the portrait is going very well.
      In the 'View' at Christies I saw a most delightful Hayman which by colour tone and drawing I think
