           Dandylion has been silly in some ways : he has been so anxious to ensure your love that he has talked more about it than acted in such a way as to attract it.   I have hopes that he will be better in the future.

           I liked your paintings, dearest.   I wonder if you are still undecided about them?

           I cannot write as much as I would like now for I have not had lunch yet and I have to get my lecture ready with a few notes.

           Your visit here was very important for it made my fears seem less urgent and renewed my confidence.

           I love you, Sylvia, love you so much.

      Dandylion has been silly in some ways: he has been so anxious to ensure your love that he has talked more about it than acted in such a way as to attract it. I have hopes that he will be better in the future.

      I liked your paintings, dearest. I wonder if you are still undecided about them?

      I cannot write as much as I would like now for I have not had lunch yet and I have to get my lecture ready with a few notes.

      Your visit here was very important for it made my fears seem less urgent and renewed my confidence.

      I love you, Sylvia, love you so much.
