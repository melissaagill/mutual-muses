      4    very well.

      The new poem seems very promising. I like it.

      By the way how did your N.G. lecture go? Have you heard anything of Charles?

      I love you very much, my dearest Lawrence, and long to see you - it is bad to be so long parted - but what can one do under the circumstances? I do think you must try a little harder to get a job - even an unattractive one at first - if necessary; which perhaps it will not be, but there are so many people after the jobs you want, who although they are not as gifted, and not always as competent, have wonderful paper qualifications
