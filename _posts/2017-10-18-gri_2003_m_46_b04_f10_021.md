      of New Malden to buy your picture. Oh, darling, I am so pleased, you have no

      about Ajax & The Poet for I did not receive your letter of 12th October until
      last night because I went straight from Liver-pool Street Station on Sunday
      to Wimbledon where I stayed until Tuesday afternoon. Therefore it is too late
      to submit it. Forgive me. I had intended to return here but when I heard father
      was in hospital already I went straight down there.\nYou ask about Parsons.
      I have just received a letter from him (I wrote last week): I quote from it:
      'For some time now, I have been unsettled & depressed by this & that. I have
      not completed the work I promised to do, nor am I able to attempt to do so at
      the moment'. He then apologises & hopes that I 'will be patient'. Obviously
      you needn't have bothered to be so nice to him at the party!\nIf janine gets
      in touch with me I am not certain I ought to put her in touch with the people
      I know, for some of them, most of them, know you as you appear with me - while
      J. knows you at Pett & connects you with Clifford and so on. As she's a neurotic
      girl I wonder whether you think she is a reliable link between your 2 worlds?
      I  will be guided by you (though I don't think Paul would like her much because
      she's one of those people you have to be rugged towards - unless I misjudge
      her. Rather like Paul's Sylvia.).\nMy cold is (for the second time) much better.
      i have an N.G. lecture at 2.00 & then Banstead. I am going to stay at Wimbledon
      the night & return here tomorrow afternoon. (Magda may be able to get me into
      some films FREE OF CHARGE!)\nI am reading lots of new American poetry at the
      moment and (I think) recovering from my dose of Ezra Pound: I admire him no
      less but think I am not the one to imitate him. \nI love you - I miss you -

      Dearest Sylvia
      Splendid news about the [unclear]Cricket [/unclear]Field! How delightful of Mr. [unclear] Pengelly[/unclear] of New Malden to buy your picture.  Oh, darling, I am so pleased, you have no idea. Oh, but, of course, you do know how glad I am.  Yes.  Do have it photographed so your [unclear] lion [/unclear]may see it in black-and-white, at least.
      Oh but there is bad news about Ajax & the [unclear]Pool[/unclear] for I did not receive your letter of 12th October until last night because I went straight from Liverpool Street Station on Sunday to Wimbledon where I stayed until Tuesday afternoon.  Therefore it is too late to submit it.  Forgive me.  I had intended to return here [unclear]but[/unclear] when I heard father was in hospital already I went straight down there.
      You ask about [unclear]Parsons[/unclear].  I have just received a letter from him (I wrote last week): I quote from it.  "For some time now, I have been unsettled & depressed by this & that.  I have not completed the work I promised to do, nor am I able to attempt to do so at the moment."  He then  apologises & hopes that I "will be patient".  Obviously you needn't have bothered to be so nice to him at the party!
      If Janine gets in touch with me I am not certain I ought to put her in touch with the people I know, for some of them, most of them, know you as you appear with me --[unclear] while[/unclear] J. knows you at [unclear]Pett[/unclear] & connects you with Clifford and so on.  As she's a neurotic girl I wonder whether you think she is a reliable link between your 2 worlds?  I will be guided by you (though I don't think Paul would like her much because she's one of those people you have to be rugged towards - unless I misjudge her.  Rather like Paul's Sylvia.).
      My cold is (for the second time) much better.  I have an N.G. [unclear]ledine[/unclear] at 2.00 then[unclear] Banstead[/unclear].  I am going to stay at Wimbledon the night & return here tomorrow afternoon.  Magda has sent a letter inviting me to [unclear]Banstead[/unclear] on Sunday: John will be there so, I believe, Myra & her husband.  I shall accept, I think.  (Myra may be able to get me into [unclear]Johns[/unclear] FREE OF CHARGE!)
      I am reading lots of new American poetry at the moment and (I think) recovering from my dose of Ezra Pound: I admire him no less but think I am not the one to imitate him.
      I love you - I miss you - I love you
      Lawrence
      P.S. Subject at [unclear]Banstead[/unclear] tonight is [unclear]c1cth[/unclear] cameos, maiolica, limoges enamel, jewels, crowns, monuments - quite a lot of the slides in color. I wish you were there. Love Lawrence
