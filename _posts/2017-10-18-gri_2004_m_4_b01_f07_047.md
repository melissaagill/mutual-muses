      Dearest Sylvia Here is the catalogue of the salon & your paintings are well hung-Greenwich as centre of a block near the window downstairs & the still life upstairs, excellently visible though not absolutely central (see diagrams in the catalogue). I am happy for you have been unqualifiedly well-hung. My congratulations sweetheart. My heart seemed to beat faster as I traveled to the gallery & my delight at seeing your pictures again was unbounded. I feel terribly buoyant & gratified now I have seen them-& properly displayed, too. You will not be surprised to learn that your pictures dominate enchantingly the exhibition-nobody is near you. Oh I am pleased. I am posting this immediate so you shall have this tomorrow, before the week-end. I love you Lawrence

      of the Salon & your paintings are well hung - Greenwich as centre of a block
      near the window downstairs & the still life upstairs, excellently visible though
      not absolutely central (see diagram in the catalogue). I am happy for you have
      been unqualifiedly well-hung. My congratulations sweet heart. My heart seemed
      to beat faster as I travelled to the gallery & my delight at seeing your pictures
      again was unbounded. I feel terribly buoyant & gratified now I have seen them
      - & seen them properly displayed, too. You will not be surprised to learn that
      your pictures dominate enchantingly the exhibition - nobody is near you. Oh
      I am pleased. I am posting this immediately so you shall have this tomorrow,
      before the week-end. I love you<br/><br/>Lawrence
