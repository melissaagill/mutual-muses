      PAINTINGS
      There are even more fine distinctions in realism in paint-
      ing than in abstract art. It is necessary to distinguish
      between conservative realism and revolutionary realism, be-
      tween late impressionism and near-expressionism, between sen-
      sational and analytical artists. It is enough, however, in
      this place, to record that realism continued in 1953 as before,
      without remarkable gains or loses. One of the most impressive
      of the realists in the least assertive, least doctrinaire of
      them: L. S. Lowry, whose Hank Manchester scenes reveal a rare
      feeling for the movement of crowds in an industrial city. Apart
      from occasional pure landscape and portraits, Lowry creates
      fine images of collective man - an essentially 20th centry con-
      cern for an artist.
      Picasso continued to draw his material from family life, but
      in a new manner. He cut down the rich, garrulous ornament
      of his cloisonne style but the impression of slightness and
      speed of execution (marked in his work since the Antibes period)
      persisted. His new family pictures were spare and flat, related
      to the War and Peace pictures of 1952, though more concentrated
      and coherent. The general feeling seemed to be that Picasso
      is not in one of his great phases: his art showed a restless in-
      dustry an ingenuity rather than a firm purpose of universal sig-
      nificances. Braque's new work, on the other hand, is a patient
      and grave development of his life-long concern with the inter-
      relationship of pictorial space and the painted surface, of

      PAINTINGS
      There are even more fine distinctions in realism in paint-
      ing than in abstract art. It is necessary to distinguish
      between conservative realism and revolutionary realism, be-
      tween late impressionism and near-expressionism, between sen-
      sational and analytical artists. It is enough, however, in
      this place, to record that realism continued in 1953 as before,
      without remarkable gains or losses. One of the most impressive
      of the realists is the least assertive, least doctrinaire of
      them: L. S. Lowry, whose Manchester scenes reveal a rare
      feeling for the moment of crowds in an industrial city. Apart
      from occasional pure landscapes and portraits, Lowry creates
      fine images of collective man - an essentially 20th century con-
      concern for an artist.
      Picasso continued to draw his material from family life, but
      in a new manner. He cut down the rich, garrulous ornament
      of his cloisonne style but the impression of slightness and
      speed of execution (marked in his work since the Antibes period)
      persisted. His new family pictures were spare and flat, related
      to the War and Peace pictures of 1952, through more concentrated
      and coherent. The general feeling seemed to be that Picasso
      is not in one of his great phases: his art showed a restless in-
      dustry and ingenuity rather than a firm purpose of universal sig-
      nificance. Braque's new work, on the other hand, is  a patient
      and grave development of his life-long concern with the inter-
      relationship of pictorial space and the painted surface, of
      exact ambiguities, as fine and as French as a paradox of
