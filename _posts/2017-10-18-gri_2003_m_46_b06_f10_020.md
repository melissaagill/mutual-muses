      itectural Review and about the Cambridge Show.
      Speaking of Cambridge, I am sorry M is pestering you. But

      do it; Paolozzi - through Pasmore - has asked me to do it. It's not definite yet but it is a likely prospect. (And as you know I am preparing the Art News article.)
       I went to Pasmore's last night. He was pleased about the Architectural Review and about the Cambridge Show.
       Speaking of Cambridge: I am sorry M is pestering you. But I hope Tiny's letter will do what is needed. Obviously you must on no account write.
       Today I shall write quite a lot (I hope) and prepare Harpenden: subjects - Perret, Gropius, Frank Lloyd Wright. Then late at night and exhausted I shall read myself to sleep with science-fiction. You know I had dinner with[unclear] Theo Gaudier ('Amro Monlatta') [/unclear]the other day: his next novel is going to be a science-fiction story. We argued S.F all evening which was very stimulating.
       I look forward to seeing the Winter Odalisque now you have worked on it again. Enjoy Rye with [unclear]Diora[/unclear] on Monday.
      I love you love you
      Lawrence
