      3  Do write to Wacko she's looking
      foreward to it - she goes back
      to school on Wednesday.
      Manhood came to-day - he seem'
      ed very pleasent - Wako didn't
      like him, found him dictatorial!
      I've no other news - I hope
      to finish the portrait to-morrow
      then, I shall do the "Kissing" water-
      colour and finish my suit.
      The matress has come back but
      luckily J. and A. can't come
      so I can get on with things.
      He is doing a new documentary
      on Greek Medical Work with
      children hasted by Humphrey
      Jenney's -apparently there are
      plenty of classical shots!
      and it is "time and profoundly
      morning" George says!  It might,
      of course, be very interesting -
      at least John will feel that it
      is not trivial
