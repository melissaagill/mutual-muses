      Blackheath  28 xi 1950

      Dearest Sylvia,
      Thank you for your new drawing of Wassilj which
      is wonderful and for your letters.  In the latest,
      which reached me this eveing, by a late post, you
      have interpreted almost to optimistically my present
      financial position.  The cheque I have has settled
      the overdraft at the bak.  It will be the next
      cheque from the Arts Council, which will be soon,
      that will support us.  That and the N.G.  8; we
      must wait a little longer unhappily.  Do not for-
      get by the way that I go to B'ham on Friday 1st
      and 8th December.  I will write you again at the
      end of the week with facts about finances: I will
      write other letters before then, of course, but I
      don't suppose I willl know quite when it is alright
      for you to come until then.  (What about Miller?)

      I have done some work on Toulouse-Iautrec (who
      is more interesting than I supposed) and I shall go
      to the V & A again tomorrow afternoon, after my
      N.G. lecture and before my Banstead one.

      Anxious as I am to see your Flight I thank I
      should not accept your invitation to Pett at the
      moment.  On Saturday, by the way, I am meeting
      Ithell Colquohoun, who, just possibly, may know
      somebody who could pay for a magazine.  I do not
      think I could come to Pett till after the second
      B'ham lecture and I hope you will be with me, here,
      by then.

      The concert on Sunday was in Red Lion Hall and I
      felt very nostalgia, remembering lectures you and I
      have attended there.  Instead of Norman Haire on the
      platform against the panelling in memory of Ann Man-
      shield Who there was the Aeolian String Quartet: Haydn's
      Quartet in D, Op 76, No 5, was superb: Beethoven's
      Quartet in B flat was difuse and tedious.  Quintet
      by Bloch was strictly for Blochheads and sounded like
      really serious film music.  No to bed.

      Blackheath          28 xi 1950
      Dearest Sylvia, Thank you for your new drawing of Wassilj which is wonderful and for your letters. In the latest, which reached me this evening, by a late post, you have intercepted almost too optimistically my present financial position. The cheque I have has settled the overdraft at the bank. It will be the next cheque from the Arts Council,  which will be soon, that will support us. That and the N.G. (pound sign)8: we must wait a little longer unhappily. Do not forget by the way that I go to B'ham on Friday 1st and 8th December. I will write you again at the end of the week with facts about finances: I will write other letters before then, of course, but I don't suppose I will know quite when it is alright for you to come until then, (What about Miller?) I have done some work on Toulouse-Lautrec (who is more interesting than I supposed) and I shall go to the V & A again tomorrow afternoon, after my N.G. lecture and before my Banstead one.
      Anxious as I am to see your Flight I think I should not accept your invitation to Pett at the moment. On Saturday, by the way, I am meeting Ithell Colquohoun, who, just possibly, may know somebody who would pay for a magazine. I do not think I could come to Pett till after the second B'ham lecture and I hope you will be with me, here, by then. The concert on Sunday was in Red Lion Hall and I felt very nostalgia, remembering lectures you and I have attended there. Instead of Norman Haire on the platform against the paneling in memory of Ann Manshield who there was the Aeolian String Quartet: Haydn's Quartet in D, Op 76, No 5, was superb: Beethoven's Quartet in B flat was diffuse and tedious. Quintet by Bloch was strictly for Blochheads and sounded like really serious film music. Now to bed.
