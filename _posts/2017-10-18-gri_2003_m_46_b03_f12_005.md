      Pett               6.5.50

      Dearest Lawrence
           I enclose a paper from the "Women" received this morning.  I wonder if you would be so kind -- at your convenience to collect -- we could put "[unclear]neni[/unclear]" in the theatre show.  The Woos bought "The Drive"
      I'm so glad to hear of your poems - how exciting - and the Portrait chapter - also [unclear]delight[/unclear].
         I will write to Mrs. Macdonald and suggest the 10th.
         I enclose a cutting which may amuse you.
         We all hope you will come to Pett.   Clifford says he will give you a big drink.
              I love you
                     Silvia
