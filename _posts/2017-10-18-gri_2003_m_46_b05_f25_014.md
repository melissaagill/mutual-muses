      TELEPHONE KIOSK

      In folk and habits of the town
      the wires cunt grass and if there's fruit
      it is pillowed, already picked.

      The alphabet-phoenix in my fish
      turns in the glass sarcophagus.
      What I said I'll say to live
      and listen the way it travels
      after it comes out of my mouth,
      any point between south and south.
      ...

      I am finding the Allen Tate book (The Fathers) I mentioned rather heavy
      going.  I have just had soe coffee (eleven o'clock) and
      read a little of it:  I may not finish it, I think.

      My doubts about the weather have been settled, since begin-
      nigh this letter.  Although the sun is out again now there
      has been a sudden downpour absolutely drenching.  Indoors.

      I met Bill Bratt the other evening and had him back for cof-
      fee and he admired your watercolor of me next door very much
      indeed.

      The other day instead of coming back hoe by train I came back by
      river bus, it being a fine afternoon and my work in town
      over for the day.  The journey is very nice, except for
      some smells and for the captain's commentary (which does
      not let up for a minute).  It takes 45 minutes to reach
      Greenwich from Charing Cross.  The commentary would stop
      me making a regular thing of it.  It is 2s. single fare.

      I have not seen Johnson in ages but he has invited me to
      lunch next Tuesday, so I shall certainly go.  He has given
      me some school lectures, I am glad to say.

      One evening this week I am meeting Alan Carter again.  I
      have not done anything more to the synopsis:  Perhaps this
      evening I shall get something down, as a change from the
      lectures.

      I love you so much.  Are you at church at this time on
      Sunday morning?  I think of you so often, so long.  Do
      you sleep in the right of your big bed as usual?  I think
      of you at night as in the day.  I do love and adore you,
      my beauty, my rose.

      TELEPHONE KIOSK
      In folk and habits of the town
      the wires count grass and if there's fruit
      it's pillowed, already picked.

      The alphabet-phoenix in my fish
      turns in the glass sarcophagus.
      What I said I'll say to live
      and listen the way it travels after it comes out of my mouth,
      any point between south and south.
      ...
      I am finding the Allen Tate book (The Father) I mentioned rather heavy going. I have just had some coffee (eleven o'clock) and read a little of it: I may not finish it, I think.

      My doubts about the weather have been settled, since begin-ning this letter. Although the sun is out again now there has been a sudden downpour, absolutely drenching. Indoors.

      I met Bill Bratt the other evening and had him back for cof-fee and he admired your watercolor of me next door very much indeed.

      The other day instead of coming back home by train I cam back by river bus, it being a fine afternoon and my work in town over for the day. The journey is very nice, except for some smells and for the captain's commentary (which does not let up for a minute). It takes 45 minutes to reach Greenwich from Charing Cross. The commentary would stop me making a regular thing of it. It is 2s. single fare.

      I have not seen Johnson in ages but he has invited me to lunch next Tuesday. so I shall certainly go. He has given me some school lectures, I am glad to say.

      One evening this week I am meeting Alan Carter again. I have not done anything more to the synopsis: perhaps this evening I shall get something down, as a change from the lectures.

      I love you so much. Are you at church at this time on Sunday morning? I think of you so often, so long. Do you sleep on the right of your big bed as usual? I think of you at night as in the day. I do love and adore you, my beauty, my rose.

      I adore you
