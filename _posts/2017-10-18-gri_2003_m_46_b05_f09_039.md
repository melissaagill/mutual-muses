      Two essential terms in the discussion of the sexual basis
      of art are (i) sexuality and (ii) sublmiation.  R. Wood has
      defined the first term in the Journal of this Society (5):
      The child is a sexual being with a rich but varied
      sexual life of its own and will habitually and spon-
      taneously engage in sexual activities which, if engaged
      in by adults, would be described in our society, as
      criminal, perverted, or insane.  These observations
      led Freud to describe the child in his famouse phase as
      'polymorphous perverse'.  Sexuality was not limited
      to the genital reion, but expressed itself also through
      other regions of the body--the ertogenetic zones.
      Adult sexuality is a complex drive made up of various instict components which became organized under the
      fominance of the genitals.
      Freud defines sublimation as follows (6):
      The sexual impulse abandons an aim previously foun
      either in the gratification of a component impulse
      or in the gratification incidental to reproduction--
      which new aim, though genetically related to the first,
      can no longer be regarded as sexual, but must be called
      social in character.
      Sublmiation is essentiall unconscious:  there is no question
      of consciously sublimating genital sexuality.  Dancing, sing-
      ing, writing, painting, all represent a scale of subtle trans-
      formations of sexual eergies.  It is not possible here to of-
      fer an explanation of what causes psychic energy to be subli-
      mated in different forms--why one man writes and anotehr paints.
      However, the need to express a repressed desire in a socially
      acceptalbe form provides the impetus for artistic creation, that
      compelling and magical act.  'The new aim', as Freud said, is

    annotation_text: "2\nappreciation.\n\nTwo essential terms in the discussion of
      the sexual basis of are are (i) sexuality and (ii) sublimation. R Wood has defined
      the first term in the Journal of this Society (5):\n\nThe child is a sexual
      being with a rich but varied sexual life of its own and will habitually and
      spontaneously engage in sexual activities which, if engaged in by adults, would
      be described in our society, as criminal, perverted or insane. These observations
      led Freud to describe the child in his famous phase as 'polymorphous perverse'.
      Sexuality was not limited to the genital region, but expressed itself also through
      other regions of the body - the erotogenetic zones.\nAdult sexuality is a complex
      drive made up of various instinct components which became organised under the
      dominance of the genitals.\n\nFreud defines sublimation as follows (6):\n\nthe
      sexual impulse abandons an aim previously found either in the gratification
      of a component impulse or in the gratification incidental to reproduction -
      which new aim though genetically related to the first, can no longer be regarded
      as sexual, but must be called social in character.\n\nSublimation is essentially
      unconscious: there is no \nquestion of consciously sublimating genital \nsexuality.
      Dancing, singing, writing, painting, all represent a scale of subtle transformations
      of sexual energies. It is not possible her to offer an explanation of what causes
      psychic energy to be sublimated in different forms - why one man writes and
      another paints. However, the need to express a repressed desire in a socially
      acceptable form provides the impetus for artistic creation, that compelling
      and magical act. 'The new aim', as Freud said, is 'genetically related to the
