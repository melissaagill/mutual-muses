      In case I forget to ask you tomorrow on the phone what did you say to Johnson, if anything, about me?  Does he know I knew you were up, have we met? It is a precaution worth taking. Sorry.

      Think of my Conversation Piece poem when you are back at Pett. Perhaps it can soothe you a little bit. And do not forget what a mutual expression of us both are The Golden Age sonnets, I sent you last. Auden says that a poet and lover should not co-incide. But he excludes the possibility of collaboration between lover and subject who are also muse and lover. Do remember this relationship. Let me have the good news when you paint again.

      Apologies are stupid between us because you know that I did not mean to hurt and that I blame the perverse expression my love took.

      I love you, my dearest Sylvia. I love you. Do not feel despairing.

      I so want to encourage you and yet I have upset you. I love you,

      Laurence
