      21st v 1953

      Last night's discussion at Hampstead went
      quite well tho' I think people understood
      Dennis Mathews & Freddie Gore better than
      myself.

      I was up till 1:00 this morning and arose
      at 7:00 - getting the article ready, and
      my NACF lecture ready too. I shall be
      glad when both are done. I wish I did
      not have to see Carter tonight.

      This is not the letter I should like to
      write - it is too short. I will have
      more time tomorrow.

      I love you, dearest Sylvia, do
      not forget a doubt it -

      I love you
      Lawrence
