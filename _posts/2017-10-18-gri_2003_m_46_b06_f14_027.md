      have any control over my emotions at the moment.<br/>I am desperately struggling
      with framing and mounting which I hate. I am in agony lest all will not be finished
      in time Gammon doesn't come and I want him to do some cutting down.<br/>I have
      finished Hervey and am read-ing Letters of his, and some of his Friends edited
      by Lord Ilchester. Which I am enjoying very much - I'm glad you are sleeping
      better. I feel sure I shall when I am with you.<br/>I am sorry financially about
      the Yorkshire lectures but delighted to be with you more - does it mean you
      are going earlier or later - on the 9th or the other end? I'm so glad your parents
      are going to help you - if my show goes reasonably  well I will help too.<br/>I
      don't suppose Michael has sent you envelopes yet - he has not sent me any I
      believe  he is frankticly busy with a girl away and clearing up a show. I wonder
      if you saw the Turner exhibit. I must see the Dutch. I love you<br/>Sylvia.<br/>
