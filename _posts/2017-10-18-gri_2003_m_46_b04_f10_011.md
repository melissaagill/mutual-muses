    annotation_text: "My main complaint about Kitty Chick's muddle is that it means
      I miss some letters from you - which is not in the least an easy thing for me
      to do for I feel very restless and lonely, being away from you so much. Do you
      know when you can come? I think you will need to bring some money with you for
      my earnings recently, none of which have yet come, are ear-marked for Mrs Harrison.\nI
      have a cold at the moment. Mother gave me rum & milk last night and today I
      shall buy Quinine-Belladonna & Camphor - a drastic but effective brew made by
      an old alchemical lion of Lionel's acquaintenance. I saw a most interesting
      advertisement the other day, put out by a trade I had thought must be underground
      theses days: so and so, \"of ALCHEMISTS, price 6D\".\nHow is my darling painter,
      my beauty, my love. Oh I hope you are well and reconciled with guilty old Tiny:
      she is like 'Digger', who was at Wimbledon last night who doesn't 'use up' all
      the 24 days leave in a year to which he's entitled. Doesn't know what to do
      with it!\nLion is going to have lunch here - go to the V & A Slide Department
      - and then home, shopping on the way, to have the evening and tomorrow at home,
      before returning to what is called the 'Eastern Region'.\nI love you, Come soon,
      I love you \nLawrence"
