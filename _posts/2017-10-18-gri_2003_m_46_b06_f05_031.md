      This is the Mayor of.. Hello, are you there.
      Could I speak to the Minister, please.
      This is the Mayor of South Eiderdown.
      Good morning, air, good morning, yes.
      I'll come to the point.
      The people of this city need
      Relief from tax. The tax is high.
      The people of this city plead...
      Isee. Thank you, sir. Good bye.

      CROWD: Well, what did he say?
      What did the minister day.

      MAYOR: He said it is out of his hands.
      He said he is in the same boat.
      He said he would help if he could
      you) And suggests that audience to to the King.
      He suggests an audience with the King.

      CROWD: with the King. An audience with the King.

      AGITATOR: Yes, the King. You must arrange it.
      Ring up the palace. Ring up the palace.

      TRAVEL-AGENT: Business is so bad. Nobody can afford
      to travel and her am I in love with a
      Princess.

      TRAVEL AGENT: Though I may be expert
      On travel abroad
      And know all the import-
      ant places you've heard
      About at school and in the movies
      It is at home and not overseas
      That my real love is.

      Nice to see the moon from a new angle
      And in an old market square to wrangle
      For exotic fruit or a slave bangle,
      But I'd be happy in one place with you.

      PRINCESS: Despite the charms of distant, hot places
      And the pleasue of seeing new faces,
      Or shouting 'They're off' in French at the races,
      I only want to go one place with you.

      I used to visit all the winter sports
      And tour the Mediterranean ports.
      But now I can take it or leave it:
      I'd gladly forsake the world, please believe it.
