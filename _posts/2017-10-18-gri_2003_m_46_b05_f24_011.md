      6    I have found out the faults
      in the landscape of "Rinaldo
      and Armita"--it was a
      patch of reed grass by Armita
      's legs--it was too light in
      tone.  I have glazed it over
      and the landscape falls nicely
      into place.  I think some
      more darks are needed.  I'm
      not sure where but I look
      hard at it every day.
      Now do answer my letters--
      you haven't for days it seems
      to me.  I shall think you
      don't love me, and I love
      you so much--dearest one.
      I love you.
