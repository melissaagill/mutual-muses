      By the way let me know if I should bring any tea.

      I have finished my dressing table still-life and have started another. I set up a combination of mirrors in order to paint the profile in "the Artist and the Critic" and when I had done all I could to this, and put some finishing touches to "Rinaldo and A." I started on another picture.

      winter sky and trees
      Deran scarf
      fawn dress
      blue cardigan
      shutter
      mirrors with profile reflects (Tiny says it's like me!)
