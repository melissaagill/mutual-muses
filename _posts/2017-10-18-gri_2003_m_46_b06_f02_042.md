      This morning (it is now noon) I must do some shopping (for Hill and Paul S. this evening) and I have promised to lend Mrs. Pasmore the programme of the National Film Theatre.  Paul is going to stay the night so we can have a gossip after Anthony has gone.

      This afternoon I plan to do a few letters and to write,  I should have about 4 hours to myself before anybody comes.

      By the way, see what I meant in my last letter about the convenience of the Quatrain for busy poets.  The phrase 'afternoon customer' in your letter suggested this (no reference to close, here, tho'):

      the afternoon customer
      inhabits the sleepy rake of autumn -
      soft felon of the debris, eating
      less than trees consign - but far more than his share.

      love you
      Lawrence  XXXXX

      P.S. To get this off in good time I am forced to use one of your envelopes.   L
