      Wimbledon 1967
      11 MANSEL ROAD,
      WIMBLEDON.

      Thursday evening

      My dearest Sylvia

      I adored your little watercolors at the head of your letter. Please, when you have time and opportunity, send me some more images.

      I am [unclear]won over[/unclear] to Johnson again of his suggestion about your [unclear]M--[/unclear] essay. And a book on O [unclear]Olson[/unclear]! Darling, I wish you would. Perhaps, soon, you can think seriously about it, but don't let it interfere until your painting now that you have started that again.

      How nice of M. to defend my poems. I do think that generous of him.

      The Venetian allusion in your projected double portrait dos not escape and I [unclear]throroughly[/unclear] approve. I am so glad you are planning it already! That kind of anticipation is, I know, a good thing in poetry and so I expect it is in painting.

      The [unclear]Soho[/unclear] and the sundial poems, as you call them, will be finished shortly. Then you shall have them, I promise.

      Thursday evening

      My dearest Sylvia,

      I adored your little watercolor at the head of your letter. Please, when you have the time and opportunity, aend me some more images.

      I am won over [unclear]to[/unclear] Salmon again of his suggestions about your [unclear]floral[/unclear] essay.  And a book on Dolson!  Darling, I wish you would.  Perhaps, soon, you can think seriously about it, but don't let it interfere with your painting now that you have started that again/

      How nice of him to defend my poems.  I do think that generous of him.

      The Venetian allusion in your projected double portrait does not escape me and I thoroughly approve.  I am so glad you are planning it already: that kind of anticipation is, I know, a good thing in poetry and so I expect it is in painting.

      The joke and the sundial poems, as you call them, will be finished shortly.  Then you shall have them, I promise.
