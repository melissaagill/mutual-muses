      Pett 4.3.52
      Dearest Lawrence,
      Just a note to say that Tiny has got a seat for me on the morning 'bus on Thursday. George says I can go to Hurstpierpoint by 'bus which saves and that she will be pick me up coming back I expect I will 'phone her and make an arrangement to-morrow for either the 11th, 12th or 14th!
      Vivian Leigh acted so well, as did the rest of the cast, and her make up was so good, the violence seemed so terrtible - that the film was most affecting - nevertheless I should very much like to see it again - Clifford has been explaining the symbolism to me - it is extremely subtle and pleasing

      ing 'bus on Thursday. George says
      I can go to Hurstpierpoint by 'bus

      'phone her and make an arrange-
      ment tomorrow for either the 11th,
      12th or 14th!
      Vivian Leigh acted so well, as
      did the rest of the cast, and
      her make up was so good, the
      violence seemed so terrible - that
      the film was most affecting - never-

      so good, the<br/>violence seemed so terrible - that<br/>the film was most affecting
      - never-<br/>theless I should very much like<br/>to see it again - Clifford
      has been<br/>explaining the symbolism to me - it<br/>is extremely subtle and
      pleasing
