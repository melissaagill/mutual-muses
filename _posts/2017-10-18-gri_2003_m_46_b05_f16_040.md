      2    her make up is truly awful!
      There's no face left!
      I do
      wish
      that you
      could come.
      I very much like your Saturation Petty
      but have not had time to read it more
      than once; and the prose poem
      seems most interestingly ingenius.
      I hope that your lecture went well
      yesterday--by the way have you
      telephoned Iris yet?
      I've no news.  I don't need to
      do much in the garden--though
      on Friday I should plant out some
      lettuces.  I have done a little
      in the rose garden and hope to
      do a little more this evening.  I shall
      and have been painting otherwise.
      Look after yourself, my dearest
      and be a wise lion.  I love you so
      much and long to see you.  I love you.  Sylvia

      do wish that you could come.<br/><br/>I very much like your Sturaliorn Ditty
      but have not had time to read it more than once; and the prose poem seems most
      interestingly ingenious<br/><br/>   I hope that your lecture went well yesterday
      -- by the way have you telephoned Iris yet?<br/><br/>   I've no news - I don't
      need to do much in the garden - though on Friday I should plant out some lettuces
      - I have done a little in the rose-garden and hope to do a little more this
      evening - I shall and have been painting other wise.<br/><br/>   Look after
      yourself, my dearest and be a wise lion - I love you so much and long to see
      you. I love you Sylvia.
