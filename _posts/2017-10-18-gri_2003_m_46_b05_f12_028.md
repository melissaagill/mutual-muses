      8 XII 1952 Dearest Sylvia,
      Here is a poem I have just written for you:
      I do not love the dark, the thin,
      And any that I could get in,
      Even for the purpose of a live.

      When you are gone whole nights and days
      No other but adds to the malaise
      Of missing you in all ways.

      Neither in word nor fact can I
      Entertain inconstancy:
      I am my own love only.'

      I do not love the dark, the thin;
      No other but adds to the malaise;
      I am my own love only.
      Until again you are my love, my rival.

      I am glad to say the weather is clear - if not
      actually fine today so I shall have no diffi-
      culty with today's travelling. It is 8:45 and
      I must be off in a moment. I hope you are
      well, sleeping well, painting easily: you are
      in my heart always, dearest dearest cat.
      I love you
      Lawrence
      P.S.
      The woodpecker we saw is still round about. L

      8 XII 1952

      Dearest Sylvia,
      Here is a poem I have just written for you:
      I do not love the dark, the thin,
      And only that I could get in,
      Even for the purpose of a life.

      When you are gone whole nights and days
      No other but adds to the malaise
      of missing you in all ways.

      Neither in word nor fact can I
      Entertain inconstancy:
      I am my own love only.

      I do not love the dark, the thin;
      No other but adds to the malaise;
      I am my own love only,
      Until again you are my love, my rival.

      I am glad to say the weather is clean - if not
      actually fine today so I shall have no diffi-
      culty with today's travelling. IC is 8.45 and
      I must be off in a moment. I hope you are
      well, sleeping well, painting easily: you are
      in my heart always, dearest dearest cat.
      Love you
      Lawrence

      P.S.
      The woodpecker I've seen is still round about. L
