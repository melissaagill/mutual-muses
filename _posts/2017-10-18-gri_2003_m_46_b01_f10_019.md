      11 Mansel Road,
      Wimbledon.
      6th November, 1948

      Dearest Sylvia,

      Your watercolours ravish me. They are beside me now. It is not enough to say thank you for them because one says that on so many occasions and this is so delightful a one. To answer them I will say 'I love you'. How different they are, the roses delicate and allusive, Fairlight impetuous and strong. I admire you as a painter, Sylvia.

      What a pleasure to meet our rose again which I saw last at your throat. What a daring composition it is: I do enjoy the placing of the vase and the way you made the dazzling white paper express light. The play of cut glass and reflected leaves is exquisite and the roses - how sensual. The emphasis on the red of the dark rose is powerful and in itself beautifully painted. Though you work directly from what you see you have the power of investing your subjects with your personality and feeling. The vermilion touches in the crimson rose take my breath away - evoking so much of the libido, in its passionate, but always pictorial, intensity.
