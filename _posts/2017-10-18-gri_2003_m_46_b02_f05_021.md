      Blackheath   14 v 1949

      Dearest love, dearest Sylvia,

      You said that you felt sure we would go
      to Italy and, darling, you were right.
      Your confidence in the book makes me happy
      and proud. I was so happy yesterday - oh
      how, how I wanted you here. Oh, my rose,
      I love you.

      I saw Hodders yesterday afternoon and I
      am going to sign the contract next Thurs-
      day after I have seen one of the directors
      to talk about production and format, &c.
      It seems they are willing to make it a really
      fine production with many illustrations.
      Cutts says he thinks I shall get a good name
      with Hogarth rather than a fortune: I think
      I shall get several hundred, however!

      I cannot get the large advance I hoped
      for and Cutts says Â£75 is the usual fee but
      this is not an obstacle because I have per-
      suaded Father to lend me a hundred. Most of
      my money comes on publication day and I can
      pay him back then without inconvenience. So
      on Monday I shall book for ITALY.

      (Lionel reminds me that my next Bursary
      cheque is due on June 1st so we shall have
      that, and more, to come back to untouched wh-
      ich is a good thing.)

      Blackheath  14 v 1949

      Dearest love, dearest Sylvia,

        You said that you felt sure we would go to Italy and, darling, you were right.  Your confidence in the book makes me happy and proud.  I was so happy yesterday - oh how, how I wanted you here.  Oh, my rose, I love you.

        I saw Hodders yesterday afternoon and I am going to sign the contract next Thursday after I have seen one of the directors to talk about production and format, &c. It seems they are willing to make it a really fine production with many illustrations. Cutts says he thinks I shall get a good name with Hogarth rather than a fortune: I think I shall get several hundred, however!

        I cannot get the large advance I hoped for and Cutts says Â£75 is the usual fee but this is not an obstacle because I have persuaded Father to lend me a hundred.  Most of my money comes on publication day and I can pay him back then without inconvenience.  So on Monday I shall book for ITALY.

        (Lionel reminds me that my next Bursary cheque is due on June 1st so we shall have that, and more, to come back to untouched which is a good thing.)
