      Blackheath
      Thursday

      Dearest Sylvia,

      Your letter upset me because I do not know when you are going to come here. You say "if I do not come before the end of the month". You left here not he 23rd August. Do you intend to stay away longer than a month?

      The agreement was that you were going to live with me and still see Michael - not the other way round. You say you will be in Pett most of November. Have you remembered that if I do St albans and you Hammersmith we shall not see much of each other during the latter part of the [unclear]. Therefore, as your suggestions stand I shall see you for about two weeks in October (Hammersmith starts 15th of that month). Then, when it is over, back to Pett.

      I am sure you cannot have realised the implications of your letter.

      Staying away longer than I anticipated, defining the time you will be here only by saying when you are going back to Pett, make me unhappy.

      Your picture for St Nicholas seems to me a gesture of atonement to the father-symbol (church and michael) to whom you have been unfaithful with me. On that level I am sorry that it is necessary. On the other hand I think that on a technical level it is a good opportunity to work on a large scale. I am sure it will be exciting in light and colour. Your sketch is very interesting.

      Please do think carefully about the next two months. I never allow writing or lectures to interfere with us and I hope that you will not do this now. Is not Hammersmith enough? It is a good thing to be offered the lectures and I am pleased but them of them in relation to ourselves.

      (If , as seems likely, you can think of a compromise - I will even vouch for Yawolla - I shall be happy do see the situation clearly.)

      Just as I know you love me despite confusions about dates and equivocation I love you, my darling Sylvia, despite my complaints in this letter. It is just because I love you that I want you to be with me as much as possible.

      I love you
      I love you

      Your letter upset me because I do not know when you are going to come here. You say 'if I do not come before the end of the month'. You left here on the 23rd August. Do you intend to stay away longer than a month?

      Please do think carefully about the next two months. I never allow writing or lectures interfere with us and I do hope that you will not do this now. Is not Hammersmith enough? It is a good thing to be offered the lectures and I am very pleased but think of them in relation to ourselves.
      (If, as seeems likely, you can think of a compromise - I will even vouch for Yawolla - I shall be happy but do see the situation clearly.)
      Just as I know you love me despite confusions about dates and equivocation I love you, my darling Sylvia, despite my complaints in this letter. It is just because I love you that I want you to be with me as much as possible
      I love you
      I love you

    clean_transcription: Blackheath   Thursday<br/>Dearest Sylvia,<br/>Your letter
      upset me because I do not know when you are going to come here. You say 'if
      I do not come before the end of the month'. You left here on the 23rd August.
      Do you intend to stay away longer than a month?<br/>The agreement was that you
      were going to live with me and still see Michael - not the other way round.
      You say you will be in Pett most of November. Have you remembered that if I
      do St Albans and you Hammersmith we shall not see much of each other during
      the latter part of October. Therefore, as your suggestions stand I shall see
      you for about two weeks in October (Hammersmith starts 15th of that month).
      Then, when its over, back to Pett.<br/>I am sure you cannot have realized the
      implications of your letter.<br/>Staying away longer than I anticipated, defining
      the time you will be here only by saying when you are going back to Pett, make
      me unhappy.<br/>Your picture for St Nicholas seems to me a gesture of atonement
      to the father-symbol (church and Michael) to whom you have been unfaithful with
      me. On that level I am sorry it is necessary. On the other hand I think that
      on the technical level it is a good opportunity to work on a large scale. I
      am sure it will be exciting in light and colour. Your sketch is very interesting.<br/>Please
      do think carefully about the next two months. I never allow writing or lectures
      interfere with us and I do hope that you will not do this now. Is not Hammersmith
      enough? It is a good thing to be offered the lectures and I am very pleased
      but think of them in relation to ourselves.<br/>(If, as seeems likely, you can
      think of a compromise - I will even vouch for Yawolla - I shall be happy but
      do see the situation clearly.)<br/>Just as I know you love me despite confusions
      about dates and equivocation I love you, my darling Sylvia, despite my complaints
      in this letter. It is just because I love you that I want you to be with me
      as much as possible<br/>I love you<br/>I love you<br/>Lawrence<br/><br/><br/>

Therefore, as your suggestions stand I shall see you for about two weeks in October (Hammersmith starts 15th of that month).  Then, when its over, back to Pett.
      I am sure you cannot have realised the implications of your letter.
      Staying away longer than I anticipated, defining the times you will be here only by saying when you are going back to Pett, make me unhappy.
      You picture for st Nicholas seems to me a gesture of atonement to the father-symbol (church and michael) to whom you have been unfaithful with me.  On that level I am sorry it is necessary.  On the other hand I think that on the technical level it is a good opportunity to work on a large scale.  I am sure it will be exciting in light and colour.  Your sketch is very interesting.
      Please do think carefully about the next two months.  I never allow writing or lectures to interfere with us and I do hope that you will not do this now.  Is not Hammer-smith enough? It is a good thing to be offered the lec-tures and I am very pleased but think of them in relation to ourselves.
      (If, as seems likely, you can think of a compromise - I will even vouch for Yawolla - I shall be happy but do see the situation clearly.)
      Just as I know you love me despite confusion about dates and equivocation I love you, my darling Sylvia, despite my complaints in this letter.  It is just because I love you that I want you to be with me as much as possible.
