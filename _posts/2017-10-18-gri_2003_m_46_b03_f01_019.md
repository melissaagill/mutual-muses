      III

      Like a cheese the target waits
      For the archers' fork,
      Made sections of, in the sun:

      The contest in the sculptured lane,
      Solved by bull-proximity,
      Scores as pleasure and as emblem

      Of agression horning-in
      On the feathered pass-time of
      The whistling Mars and Cupid.

      I have more work at the moment than I can do
      with the consequently feel at long last anxiety.
      I keep neurotically counting over the days before
      my next lecture and so on.  Perhaps I shall be
      better after tomorrow's lecture.

      I adore you, I love you so much
      Lawrence
