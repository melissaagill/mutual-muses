      How did you enjoy (assuming you did go) Canterbury?

The guard, waving the train on, at Lewisham : panorama behind, green flag conspicuous, warm expressionist model.

      This afternoon [unclear] Hart [/unclear] is coming to the T G. I will let you know if he mentions Pett. He won't be coming immediately because he is going away for the Bank Holiday I know. I shall try & persuade him to take me to see A Place in the Sun.

      Dearest Sylvia

      How did you enjoy (assuming you did
      go) Canterbury? The last time I was there I
      spent the entire day drawing: I spent some
      of the money I earned at the wallpaper [unclear][/unclear]
      on my first holiday alone at Margate. From
      there I visited the Cathedral. Speaking of
      drawing: if I do start again (& I may
      not really have time) I have a subject.
      The guard, waving the train on, at Lewis-
      ham: panorama behind,
      green flag conspicuous,
      warm-expressionist model.
      Something like this:
      What do you think of it, as
      an idea?

      This afternoon Hart is
      coming to the TG. I will let
      you know if he mentions Pett. He won't
      be coming immediately because he is going
      away for the Bank Holiday I know. I

         This afternoon Mark is coming to the TG. I will let you know if he mentions Pett. He won't be coming immediately because he is going away for the Bank Holiday I know. I shall try to persuade him to take me to see A Place In The Sun.

      you did go) Canterbury? The last time I was there I spent the entire day drawing:
      I spent some of the money I earned at the wallpaper exh. on my first holiday
      alone at Margate. From there I visited the cathedral. Speaking of drawing: if
