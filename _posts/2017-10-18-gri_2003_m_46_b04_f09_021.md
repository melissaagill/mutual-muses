      ELEGY FOR MARIA MONTEZ

      Although for some, elegies are delayed,
      Held in the plenitude fatal to tears,
      And future bibliographers lament
      Darwinian survivors - guilt implores
      Some monuments to test and prove our grief.

      She was superstitious:  then my words
      Shall be no slab between her and the stars
      Who, dislocated from their light, yet flash
      In markets of the void; she was drowned
      In a liquid chantry let her float forever.

      Her hair was water and it fell across
      Lips which had shaped for love and learned the sighs
      Of tropical women at whom she played
      In a looking glass the size of memory.

      Uncouth harbour - that it could engulf
      So easily the trusting multitude
      Of heroines who lingered in her parts:
      How many died in her,
      Mirrors watch women for a sign of life.

      The cruise was fiction but desire
      Is the circles around a swimmer,
      Pagan haloes worn by pearl-divers:
      Dead star in the vase of September,
      Your hair is for the locket of the grave
      And heroines you mimed shall mime you now.

      ELEGY FOR MARIA MONTEZ

      Although for some, elegies are delayed,
      Held in the planitude fatal to tears,
      And future bibliographers lament
      Darwinian survivors--guilt implores
      Some monuments to test and prove our grief.

      She was superstitious:  then my words
      Shall be no slab between her and the stars
      Who, dislocated from their light, yet flash
      In markets of the void; she was drowned,
      In a liquid chantry let her float forever.

      Her hair was water and it fell across
      Lips which had shaped for love and learned the sighs
      Of tropical women at whom she played
      In a looking glass the size of memory.

      Uncouth harbour--that it could engulf
      So easily the trusting multitude
      Of heroines who lingered in her parts:
      How many died in her.
      Mirrors watch women for a sign of life.

      The cruise was fiction but desire
      Is the circles around a swimmer,
      Pagan haloes worn by pear-divers:
      Dead start in the vase of September,
      Your hair is for the locket of the grave
      And heroines you mimed shall mime you now.
