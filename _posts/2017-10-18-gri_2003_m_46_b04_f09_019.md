      SOLILOQUY ON THE BEACH

      When the solemn conch stopped the waves
      Went on as echoes and here I sun;
      A cage of breakwaters keep the hills
      From being giantesses and running
      Into, the sea and getting submerged.
      That's all there is between them and the sea.

      Shells like coolies' hats and clowns
      Trying to pull themselves out of the blue wreck:
      Grey lazzaroni roll in the waves,
      Shadows of the clown-capped breakers.

      The sea is a green machine or green tree,
      Blue dial on which the boats are numerals
      Or blue growth of a romantic forest
      Over which the sun's a wheel or bird's nest.

      Clouds are flying-fish, you believe in them, but white.
      Clouds are numbers above the water-line:
      The sky is full when we can't read them.
      The red queen must have begun as a seagull,
      Fanning vigorously and not moving,
      Like a weather-vane, the wind's prisoner.

      If people used to be smaller and bones
      Get solid in good time, this shell may be
      The skull of Christopher Columbus' cook,
      Caught one storm on knives and forks of water.

      Scoops of blue, white eels, spume fans.

      My eyes are drowned in sunglasses, seaweed color;
      Several fathoms down I address
      Birds as barnacles, belles as buried caryatids,
      Livid, purple, having put by the roses.

      Chairs may be seen in flight: the chair steals
      Bubbles from upstairs but loses them.
      The feet of swimmers are candelabra
      Alight in the blue staterooms where
      The drowned god spends his season
      Waiting for the Summer you and I enjoy.

      Soliloquy on the beach
      When the solemn conch stopped the waves
      Went on as echoes and here I sun;
      A cage of backwaters ang running
      Into the sea and getting submerged.
      That;s all there is between them and the sea.

      Shells like coolies' hats and clowns
      Trying to pull themselves out of the blue wreck:
      Grey lazzaroni rell on the waves,
      Shadows of the clown-capped breakers.

      SOLILOQUY ON THE BEACH

      When the solemn conch stopped the waves
      Went on as echoes and here I sun;
      A cage of breakwaters keep the hills
      From being giantesses and running
      Into the sea and getting submerged.
      That's all there is between them and the sea.

      Shells like coolies' hats and clowns
      Trying to pull themselves out of the blue wreck:
      Grey lazzaroni roll in the waves,
      Shadows of the clown-capped breakers.

      The sea is a green machine or green tree,
      Blue dial on which the boats are numerals
      Or blue growth of a romantic forest
      Over which the sun's a wheel or bird's nest.

      Clouds are flying-fish, you believe in them, but white.
      Clouds are numbers above the water-line:
      The sky is full when we can't read them.
      The red queen must have begun as a seagull,
      Fanning vigorously and not moving,
      Like a weather-vane, the wind's prisoner.

      If people used to be smaller and bones
      Get solid in good time, this shell may be
      The skull of Christopher Columbus' cook,
      Caught one storm on knives and forks of water.

      Scoops of blue, white eels, spume fans.
      My eyes are drowned in sunglasses, seaweed color;
      Several fathoms down I address
      Birds are barnacles, belles as buried caryatids,
      Livid, purple, having put by the roses.

      Chairs may be seen in flight:  the chair steals
      Bubbles from upstairs but loses them.
      The feet of swimmers are candelabra
      Alight in the blue staterooms where
      The drowned god spends his season
      Waiting for the Summer you and I enjoy.
