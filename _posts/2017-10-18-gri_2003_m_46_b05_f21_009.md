      2    I told Tiny what you said about
      Rosamond Tune and Eurposon and she
      wondered if RT had understood
      Empson as she says she though he
      was medieval enough!  Like a dutiful
      cat I am reading the taller on Criticism
      and find them most interesting and stim-
      ulating--thank you Lion.
      I have just been in to Hastings to the
      Bank and have bought some more new
      cat cards!
      I'm very sorry to hear about molly--
      I do hope she will soon be well again
      for it sounds quite horrid!  Do give her
      my love and best wishes for a quite
      recovery.
      The Butchers' daughter's novel sounds
      wonderful, or as Mrs. Gladys Wood
      would say magnificent!  If it is
      really full I should love to read it!
      My putting the apostrophe in the wrong
      place above reminds me that Mine
      Wood wrote to Clifford and Marjorie
      "My dear one's"!

      2 I told Tiny what you said about Rosamund [unclear] Lime [/unclear] and Empson and she wondered if R.T. had understood Empson as she says she thought he was medieval enough! Like a dutiful cat I am reading the talks on criticism and find them most interesting and stimulating - thank you [unclear] Lisa [/unclear].
      I have just been in to Hastings to the Bank and have bought some more new cat cards!
      I'm very sorry to hear about Molly - I do hope she will soon be well again for it sounds quite horrid! Do give her my love and best wishes for a quite recovery.
      The Butchers' daughter's novel sounds wonderful, or as Mrs Gladys Wood would say magnificent! If it is really full I should love to read it! My putting the apostrophe in the wrong place above reminds me that Mrs Wood wrote to Clifford and Marjorie "My dear One's"!
