      Dearest Lawrence,
      I am so glad you went to the Barber again - and that your lecture went well, and was appreciated - it sounds most interesting - I do wish I had heard it, Toulouse sounds most eclectic! I wish you had had some lunch before hand - you should have made some sandwiches. Rusel sounds a most congenial oerson!

      Thank you so much for taking such pains with my article - it is kind - I'm afraid I did not even notice the spelling! By the way did you notice that on the 5th the arcade Gallery has a show of Baroque and Roccoco Italian paintings? Perhaps Gainsborough has asked you already.

      I wonder if you are doing the Hogarth and Wilson N.G. lecture! I expect you have the Goldsmith's college on Wednesday morning.

      Thank you so much for the delightful poems - the Lion as Hesmit -  up delicious images! I think that the "religious" images are very useful

      glad you went to the Barber again, and that your lecture went well, and was

      sounds most eclectic painter!  I wish you had had some lunch before hand - you
      should have made some sandwiches.  Russel sounds a most congenial person!\nThank
      you so much for taking such (Paints! (scratched out)) pains with my article
      - it is kind - I'm afraid I did not even notice the spelling!  By the way did
      you notice that on the 5th the [unclear]Heade [/unclear]Gallery has a show of
      Baroque and Roccoco [unclear]Haliar[/unclear] paintings?  Perhaps Gainsborough
      has asked you already.  \nI wonder if you are doing the Hogarth and Wilson [unclear]N.G
      [/unclear]lecture!  I expect you [unclear]leave [/unclear]the Goldsmith's college
      on Wednesday morning.\nThank you so much for the delightful poems - the Liar

      are very useful"
