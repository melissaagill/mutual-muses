      Pett     25.9.51

      Dearest Lawrence, Here are some cuttings that you asked for, and some which may amuse you.  I confess I was a little bored with [unclear]Bowen [/unclear]- it was all very true and yet -- I don't know why it was not very stimulating.  Perhaps I was just not in the mood.
         I am delighted to hear about the umbrella and that the Whistler lecture went well.
         I will write again this evening.  Now I will catch the post.
