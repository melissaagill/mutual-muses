      Blackheath
      24 ii 1950

      Dearest Sylvia,

      Wassily is ravishing and I thank you so much for her portrait. Dandy promptly fainted with pleasure at this beautiful cat and Lionel turned pale, then recovering swiftly, complimented you on a charming likeness.

      I envy Clifford's lecture though I seem to detect a slight dis-satisfaction with it in your phrases? Am I right?

      No, I did not see Gainsborough on Tuesday but I may in a day or two.

      I am glad to hear about Savage and his publisher, how encouraging. Glad about the lecture.......

      I intended to see the Fuseli exhibition again but I shall not be able to as I don't think I shall go to town again till next week.

      I saw both Pauls yesterday and had a very pleasant time: I saw an early Chaplin film, with a script, I am convinced, by Alfred Jarry: it is outrageously erotic with explosions, stickinesses, &c.

      This letter must be rather short - 'scrappy' - as I have several more to write and must go shopping.

      I miss you. I love you.
      Lawrence

      Blackheath
      24 ii 1950
      Dearest Sylvia
      Wassily is ravishing and I thank you so much for he portrait. Dandy promptly fainted with pleasure at this beautiful can and Lionel turned pale, then, recovering swiftly, complimented you on a charming likeness.
      I envy you Clifford's lecture though I seem to detect a slight dis-satisfaction with it in your phrases? Am I right?
      No, I did not see Gainsborough on Tuesday but I may in a day or two.
      I am glad to hear about Savage and his publisher, how encouraging. Glad too about the lecture .......
      I intended to see the Fuseli exhibition again but I shall not be able to as I don't think I shall go to town again till next week.
      I saw both Pauls yesterday and had a very pleasant time: I saw an early Chaplin film, with a script, I am convinced, by Alfred Jarry: it is outrageously erotic with explosions, stickiness, &c.
      This letter must be rather short - 'scrappy' - as I have several more to write and must go shopping.
      I miss you. I love you,
