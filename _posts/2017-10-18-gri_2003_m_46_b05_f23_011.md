      2 crammed with pretty china -
      all early 19th and all cracked!
      I was evidently expected to
      identify pieces - well I did my
      best - and said how delightful
      everything was - I think Mrs
      Ludgate was fairly satisfied.
      How ever I think the lecture
      went very well - I spoke for
      45 minutes and mainly defined
      the methods and types
      of china and pottery - they
      seemed attentive - no one
      rattled cups and they seemed
      to be awake. Afterwards they
      looked at the photographs and
      asked my questions - which
      thank god, I could answer -
      and they seemed very appre-
      ciative - wished I could have
      gone on longer and they could
      have a course! There were
      about 150 - the place was
      packed - I shall take
      up lecturing on pottery ect!

      2 crammed with pretty china - all early 19thC and all cracked! I was evidently expected to identify pieces - well I did my best - and said how delightful everything was - I think Mrs Ludgate was fairly satisfied.
         How ever I think the lecture went very well - I spoke for 45 minutes and mainly defin-ed the methods and types of china and pottery - they seemed attentive - no one rattled cups and they seemed to be awake. Afterwards they looked at the photographs and asked me questions - which thank god I could answer - and they seemed very appre-ciative - wished I could have gone on longer and they could have a course! There were about 150 - the place was packed - I shall take up lecturing on pottery etc.!
