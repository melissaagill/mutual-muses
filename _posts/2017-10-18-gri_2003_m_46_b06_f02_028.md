      Banstead this evening: Roman Baroque Art.
      The weather is bad: 'very stormy' as the baro-
      meter say, 'continueing wet'. Lunch with
      CJ today.
      I think you should write to Home & Gardens
      but send the draft as soon as you are ready
      and I will type it immerdiately and return it.

      Thank you for Blaker, by the way. I will
      look up the pages you recommended letter
      or two book.

      I am glad that C is so good to weep on.
      But I am not glad that you are weeping.
      My poor darling, I hope you will soon feel
      more self-possessed and comfortable.

      Michael Chare's number has been engaged
      most of the afternoon. When I tried again
      just now, however, - twice - there was no
