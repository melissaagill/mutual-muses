      The Chairman mispronounced my name.  The audience, about 30, was mainly feminine. My lec-ture was a nice balance of insult and encouragement, exploring more clearly than was quite polite the inade-quacies of the publics approach to painting, insisting on the need for a more reasonable approach. [unclear]&c. &c. &c.[/unclear]  The Chairman made 2 contributions to the discussion that followed which showed he had completely failed to master my distinction between Art and Nature.  When he stood up to speak his trousers sank & the top of his pants was visible.
      The Reporter who was silly here, you remember, wrote well enough in the paper and was very much on my side in the discussion after the lecture.  I don't believe I have a generalisation left, even about cretins.
      Undoubtedly the exhibition has sailed in Harpenden and perhaps it will do better in Redbaum where it's been advertised seriously.  3 girls are tip-toeing round the [unclear]pictures[/unclear] as I write, whispering, [unclear]breaking[/unclear] into subdued mirth at Wood, Pipes, Modgrins.
