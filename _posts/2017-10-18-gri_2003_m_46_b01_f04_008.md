      yourself, Sylvia.
           Thank you, this is the second thank
      you already, for saying such nice
      things about my poetry. It is enormous-
      ly  encouraging and causes me much
      delight. You are kind and sensitive
      about them.
           That new constellation you created
      recently stood me in good stead last
      night and guided me infallibly home, as
      I was fairly late. I'm glad [unclear]Dumas[/unclear]
      has got his just deserts! I wondered what would become of him! I'm afraid I went
      in the Mandrake last night with John McHale.
      He had some money so for the first time
      in ages I wasn't round the  [unclear]solo ruds[/unclear].
      Apart from this I have worked & worked
      so I hope I won't be [unclear]changed[/unclear] into anything.
          I do hope that your next letter (you
      referred to it in your last one) will be
      longer. I do know how difficult it is.
      Just - hell! - can't you write a page or
      two in the lavatory or something? Please.
          Is 'Italic England' good? I'm trying to
      understand [unclear]Pennintes Fletdes and Perines[/unclear]
      together. It's my only chance. Soon I shall
      see you. This Friday. At least the exam-
      ination will do that. So you remember

      yourself, Sylvia

      Thank you, this is the second 'thank you' already, you saying such nice things about my poetry.  It is enormously encouraging and causes me much delight.  You are kind and sensitive about them.

      That new constellation you created recently [unclear][/unclear]me in good stead last night and guided one infailingly  home, as I was fairly late.  I'm glad [unclear][/unclear] has got his just deserts.  [unclear] wondered[/unclear] what would become of him.  I'm afraid I [unclear][/unclear] last night with [unclear][/unclear] for the last time[unclear][/unclear][unclear][/unclear][unclear][/unclear][unclear][/unclear] apart from this I have [unclear][/unclear] & [unclear][/unclear] as I hope won't be changed into anything.

      I do hope that your next letter (you referred to it in you rlast one) will be longer.  I do know how difficult it is but - well - can't you write a page on [unclear] [/unclear] in the lavatory or something ? Please.

      Is 'Little England' good ?  I'm tying to understand  [unclear][/unclear] [unclear]Fletcher[/unclear] and [unclear]Perkins[/unclear] together, it's my only choice.  ~Soon I shall see you.  This Friday.  At least the examinations will do that.  Do you remember

      Thank you, this is the second 'thank you' already, for saying such nice things about my poetry. It is enormously encouraging and causes me much delight. You are kind and sensitive about them.

      That new constellation you created recently stood me in good stead last night and guided me infallibly home, as I was fairly late. I'm glad [unclear]Duncs[/unclear] has got his just desserts. I wondered what would become of him. I'm afraid I went to see [unclear]mardrake [/unclear] last night with [unclear]John wethall[/unclear]. He had some money so for the first time for ages I went round the [unclear]safe[/unclear] pubs. Apart from this I have worked & worked so I hope I won't be changed into anything.

      I do hope that your next letter (you referred to it in your last one) will be longer. I do know how difficult it is but – well – can't you write a page or [unclear]two[/unclear] in the lavatory or something? Please.

      Is '[unclear]ratlic sergeant[/unclear]' good? I'm trying to understand Banister Fletcher and [unclear]Persner cogetha[/unclear]. It's my only choice. Soon I shall see you. This Friday. At least the imagination will do that. Do you remember
