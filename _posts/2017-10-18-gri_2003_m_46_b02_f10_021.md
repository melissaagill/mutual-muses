      though the acting was very good.  I am back in Charley Parsley's favour for he wants me to dine with him at Vincent's House, soon.  That will be all right provided I have some dinner before I go.

      I thought of you yesterday morning, painting Ruth: it is the only painting of yours I have not seen yet.  I hope this sitting went agreeably.  There has been a slight delay but I should have Twelve Master-pieces any moment: do you want it sent to you at Pett or, if it should not come, till the end of the week, kept here for you?  By the way, have you made those last touches to Tiny, or as I suppose, have you  lacked sufficient leisure?  It is a very good portrait I think.

      I was very lucky the other day - I managed to get some Bel Paese cheese in Soho.  I shall finish it up today for lunch.  It reminds me of our meals in Flor-ence (not in Rome where we seemed to get the wrong cheese quite often). The A.I.A. meeting was in the lecture room of the Courtauld and memories of our early times together were very strong there.

      I do love you, sweetheart, and adore you.  I hope that you are well and get a few chances to be lazy (Yeats said that the creative artist must have the opportunity to be lazy)/.  I adore you.

      I have written, hastily, but my pleasure could not wait[unclear][/unclear]polish it, and ode about Minerva's ring, our ring.  I adore your gift so much.  I love you Lawrence.

      IV
      though the acting was very good. I am back in Charley Parsley's favour for he wants me to dine with him at Vincent House, soon. That will be all right provided I have some dinner before I go.
      I thought of you yesterday morning, painting Ruth: it is the only painting of yours I have not seen yet. I hope this sitting went agreeably. There has been a slight delay but I should have Twelve Masterpieces any moment: do you want it sent to you at Pett or, if it should not come till the end of the week, kept here for you? By the way, have you made those last touches to Tiny or, as I suppose, have you lacked sufficient leisure? It is a very good portrait I think.
      I was very lucky the other day-I managed to get some Bel Paese cheese in Soho. I shall finish it up today for lunch. It reminds me of our meals in Florence (not in Rome where we seemed to get the wrong cheese quite often). The A.I.A. meeting was in the lecture room of the Courtauld and memories of our early times together were very strong there.
      I do love you, sweetheart, and adore you. I hope that you are well and get a few chances to be lazy (Yeats said that the creative artist must have the opportunity to be lazy). I adore you.
      I have written, hastily, but my pleasure could not wait to polish it, an ode about Minerva's ring, our ring. I adore your gift so much.
      I love you
      Lawrence
