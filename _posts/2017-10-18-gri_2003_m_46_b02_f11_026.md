      Redcar
      Tuesday
      Dearest Sylvia
      Here is your poem - your enquiry about it in this morning's letter stimulated me to do something about it.  Yesterday - and still today - I have been bored and dilatory.  No doubt about it, I am a gregarious & extraverted person - needing intellectual or gay conversation.  An introvert might be happy here - but not me.  I was creative when I came here, witness the poem, which I hope pleases you, but the environment has put an end to that.  Even my pleasure in reading has slackened as a result of surfeit or, perhaps, as Mrs Moorlane sympathetically suggested, 'too much reading - that's bad for the head'.
      No I shall not stay here - whatever happens to the still-missing exhibition.  In fact I may come back on Thursday.  If I do please try and come on Friday for if you go back on Tuesday to Pett - and do not

      Tuesday
      Dearest Sylvia
      Here is your poem - your enquiry about it in
      this morning's letter stimulated me to do something
      about it. Yesterday - and still today - I have
      been bored and dilatory. No doubt about it, I
      am a gregarious & extroverted person - needing in-
      tellectual OR gay conversations. An introvert might
      be happy here - but not me. I was creative when I
      came here, witness the poem, which I hope pleases
      you, but the environment has put an end to that.
      Even my pleasure in reading has slackened as a
      result of surfeit or, perhaps, as Mrs Moorhouse
      sympathetically suggested, 'too much reading -
      that's bad for the head!'
      No I shall not stay here - whatever happens to
      the still-missing exhibition. In fact I may come back
      on Thursday. If I do, please try and come on Friday
      for if you go back on Tuesday to Pett - and do not
