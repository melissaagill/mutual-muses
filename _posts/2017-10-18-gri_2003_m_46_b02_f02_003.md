                 I sit in the chintz chair,
                     Single and sleepy.
                 Do I revive the portrait
                       I sat for in this chair?

                 This room must be the site
                       For portraits and roses,
                  For that encounter
                        We shortly can perform.

                  I shall know you by your emblems:
                         The owl shall welcome light.
                  The lion jump from the shadows,
                          His mane on fire.

         Mrs. Gardiner, by the way, left our coffee and sandwiches
      for me when I came back last from Banstead which was nice I
      thought.

         When you come I shall have the place a little fitter.
      I shall have a proper supply of fruit and things like that
      which will help a bit.  I have obtained a train time-table
      and find I can understand it though for some strange reason
      it is written in an obscure foreign tongue...

         Dearest, I love you, think of you all the time.

         I love you and thank you for your letter - I love you

                                              Lawrence

      I sit in the chintz chair,
      Single and sleepy.
      Do I revive the portrait
      I sat for in this chair?

      This room must be the site
      For portraits and roses,
      For that encounter
      We shortly can perform.

      I shall know you by your emblems:
      The owl shall welcome light.
      The lion jump from the shadows,
      His mane on fire.

      Mrs Gardiner, by the way, left our coffee and sandwiches for me when I came back late from Banstead which was nice I thought.

      When you come I shall have the place a little fitter.  I shall have a proper supply of fruit and things like that which will help a bit.  I have obtained a train-time-table and find I can understand it though for some strange reason it is written in an obscure foreign tongue...

      Dearest, I lone you, think of you all the time.

      I love you and [unclear]cherish[/unclear] you for your [unclear]cotte[/unclear] - I love you

      Lawrence
