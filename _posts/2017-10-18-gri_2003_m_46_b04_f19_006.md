      3. make something of it - I wished I had my oils with me! I think she was rather depressed but did her best to be cheerful. I lent her the Sickert, she seemed very pleased - I was very pleased to have her, and told her so. I turned out the old room after tea and in the evening, which was glorious & cut off the dead roses and seeded lupins in the hope of more flowers Mrs Owens was working in the garden and we exchanged gruff "pleasantries"!! I had some young beans for my lunch and ate them pods and all - they were delicious.
      It rained all night - I slept very well until 8.15! and is raining on and off this morning - it smells delicious I don't think I shall  be able to do any painting though - I shall patch up the church board and turn out
