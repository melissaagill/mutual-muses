      Dearest Lawrence,
      I have just got to
      Cooden Beach having lunched
      with George and John at
      Hayward's Heath. I shall
      catch the quarter to five 'bus.
      They were very pleasant to me
      indeed and the whole evening
      and morning went very well.
      The play turned out to be most
      enjoyable after all - and played
      delightfully in a wonderful
      set - really first rate. I
      roared with laughter, and
      the adjucieator, who was a
      very pleasant person, loved
      it and was most appreciative
      of the production. George is very
      happy - and John almost!
