      13th February 1949
      Hampton Court
      Palace

      Dearest Sylvia,
      No, I have no appointments on Tues-
      day and will meet you whenever you
      arrive. I believe there is a train
      from Hastings to [unclear]Claring[/unclear] Cross at
      11.15 (don't rely on this without
      checking, however) which seems a
      good time. Then we would have
      lunch on your arrival - a better
      idea than sandwiches on the train.
      However, I will fit in with any
      plan you put in your next letter -
      so assume I shall meet you at
      any time, my dearest love.

      I hope you have a nice weekend.
