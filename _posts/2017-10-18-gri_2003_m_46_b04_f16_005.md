      I am most delighted to hear of your I.C.A. debate - it will be amusing - you will meet more people and be in the public eye. How nice of Sylvester. I only hope that you will not be too tired - for you seem to have a busy week.

      of your IS.A. debate - it wioll be amazing - you will meet more people and be
      in the public eye. How nice of Sylvester. I only hope that you will not be too
      tired - for you seem to have a busy week. Thank you for the charming and lavish
      picture of me painting - so delightfully attended! By the way I hope that you
      aren't too kind to [unclear]Buffet[/unclear] - he seems limp and timid to me
      - but perhaps he is bettwr now. I like what I know of [unclear]Helior[/unclear].
      I'm so glad your lecture went well, except for Dr. Pearee Charles party sounds
      the end! Thank you so much for the poems how delicious - I do enjoy them! "
