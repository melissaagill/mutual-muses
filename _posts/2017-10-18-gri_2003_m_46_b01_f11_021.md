      11 Mansel Road Wimbledon

      9th December 1948

      Dearest Sylvia,

      At last I have time to write a proper letter. My lecture is not until 3.30 and it is now 10. What a wind there is! No listener has come - I expect the paper boy has been blown away. I hope your cold is not too uncomfortable. I have now heard from Killam-Roberts & Rose & I am seeing them both on Tuesday. Do you think I could come on Monday? Will your cold permit - darling? Every day's delay is sad - so much do I long to see you. Please - I should adore to have your picture when I come - I will talk to Eric about a frame - what kind would you prefer?
