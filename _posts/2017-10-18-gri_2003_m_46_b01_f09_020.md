      Wimbledon

      14th October 1948

      Dearest Sylvia,

      Do not think this deluge of Letters absurd. I know I ought to have written one long orderly one rather than three scattered ones, but I want to make contact with you so strongly that I forget the propriety of writing. Forgive this.

      What I want to say, but shirked in the other letters, is important. My heart and mind are c entred on this matter. Do not dispair.

      I can imagine what Tiny and Clifford will think of Michael and me and, my God, won't they be right! I am sorry and I can only say that I think I have learned.

      Oh, my dearest love, do not despair.

      I hope you enjoyed the Soane; it was a good thing you decided to see it as the weather has steadily improved and is now, 5.15, really pleasant. I expect this will help the journey. What did Michael think of the extraordinary place?

      11 Mansel Road,
      Wimbledon
      14th October 1948

      Dearest Sylvia,

      Do not think this deluge of Letters absurd. I know I ought to have written one long orderly one rather than three scattered ones, but I want to make contact with you so strongly that I forget the propriety of writing. Forgive this.

      What I want to say, but shirked in the other letters, is important. My heart and mind are centered on this matter. Do not despair.

      I can imagine what Tiny and Clifford will think of Michael and me and, my God, won't they be right! I am sorry and I can only say that I think I have learned.

      Oh, my dearest love, do not despair.

      I hope you enjoyed the Soane; it was good thing you decided to see it as weather has steadily improved and is now, 5.15, really pleasant. I expect this will help the journey. What did Michael think of the extraordinary place?
