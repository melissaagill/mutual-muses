      companionship here. Yesterday, as you knowk I saw Bedford's Tower. Dierdre goes

      \     You are never out of my thoughts. Imagination and memory combine to haunt
      and enchant me. How vividly I remember our winter run on the beach. it was then

      sad as i am without you my pleasure in the country and fine weather consoles
      me, for landscape in England is intimately bouond up with your presence, now.
      I remember when I was in Paris you said the spring wind on the nape of your
      neck was like my kiss. Now i observe the wind now, soft yet conofident, combing
      the valley and secret groves. but I do not need the pathetic fallacy to convey
      how much I love you. It is only ten days to the 30th.  I long to see you so
      that we can be cruely gay about [unclear]Johnson[/unclear] again. but of course
      that is only one of many reasons and one from low down on the list. But you
      are so amusing and its one quality  I value in you. And the others? Well, you
