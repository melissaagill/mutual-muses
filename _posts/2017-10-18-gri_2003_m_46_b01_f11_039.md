      11 Mansel Road,
      Wimbledon

      17th December 1948

      Dearest Sylvia,

      Thank you, Sylvia, for a lovely
      day yesterday. I hope it did not
      tire you. I was very happy being
      with you again. Rye and Camber
      Castle were lovely. Some of our
      conversation was serious but that
      was necessary. Oh, dearest, how
      I love you.

      When I got home imagine my enchant-
      ment at finding a letter from you.
      And what a nice letter. You were so
      nice about my poems that, late as it
      was, I developed some of the images I
      started in the train. So in my next
      letter I shall send some more verse.

      I was furious last night at the
      uselessness of electric light when I
      tried to compare oil and watercolour.
      Soon as I woke this morning, however,
      I set them together. How happy I am
      to possess that picture. Darling,
      I am so proud of your achievement.

      The while Owl is very put out at
      missing the party but the thought of
      being with you permanently soon stops
      him from being very cross with me.
