      is that you wear them so well.<br/>When I opened my bedroom door<br/>and leant
      across the bed to put the <br/>light on, the rich heavy perfume of<br/>our two
      roses weighted and sweetened<br/>the air. I shall sleep tonight with them by
      me. Talking of roses I<br/>am pleased you liked my room better.<br/>I must thank
      you for your gifts<br/>of food. as cook you know how valu -<br/>able they were.But
      what I must real -<br/>ly thank you for is coming so soon to<br/>see me. I do
      know what a trial it<br/>is and I know your divided loyalty<br/>must be painful.
      I did not intend<br/>to be so emotional because it may<br/>worry you but, as
      you know, it was<br/>involuntary. Do not fear, though,<br/>because seeing you
      again, being<br/>soothed and charmed and satisfied by<br/>you after a long gap
      has made me<br/>better.Tonight happy/sad, calm/<br/>longing, all those things
      I am, yet they<br/>are I think somewhat balanced. So do<br/>not feel angst on
      my behalf, your<br/> love has helped me where you absence<br/>upset me.<br/>27.VIII
      1948<br/>I wrote the above last night because I was<br/>so full of you and had
      to 'talk' to you and<br/>a letter was the only means at my disposal
