      19th January 1949 11 Mansel Road Wimbledon

      Dearest Sylvia,

      I adore the way you write Apollo - so that the A resembles a fine rose. I am happy that you enjoy the Sestina. I shall try and write you a vilanelle if I can make time.

      This morning I have written to Skipp, claiming 6. 13s. 1d. expenses. This, including my eleven guineas, I shall recoup over 17. This does not cover all we spent but it is good enough and I do not want to abuse Skipp's help.

      On Friday evening at Craybrook, Kent, I shall talk apparently about 18th French Art. I am having my mane powdered, my brow ironed, my nails polished, and, perhaps, I shall be able to wear my new blue 'waist-coat'...

      The Courtauld lectures would be stimulating and important and I certainly think we should go to them. Have you any news of the plates in Hastings?

      Oh, by the way, yes, there is a bathroom in the annex.

      I love you so much and I cannot express how much I long for you. I am glad you had a talk with Tiny and if you want to start with a three-month arrangement I will agree. I adore you, my beautiful love. I shall go to Blackheath about next Monday. Will you come, dearest, not too long after that - say about the end of next week? I will tell you exactly when I will go shortly. The address is 109 Blackheath Park, Blackheath. If it were necessary for us to move in suddenly we could do so.

      I must fly to Observer office now. I love you,
      Lawrence

      19th January 1949           11 Mansel Road Wimbledon

      Dearest Sylvia,
      I adore the way you write Apollo - so that the A resembles a fine rose. I am happy that you enjoy the Sestina. I shall try and write you a vilanelle if I can make time.
      This morning I have written to Skipp, claiming [pound symblol]6. 13s 1d. expenses. Thus, including my eleven guineas, I shall recoup over [pound symbol]17. This does not cover all we spent but it is good enough and I do not want to abuse Skipp's help.
      On Friday evening at Craybrook, Kent, I shall talk apparently about 18th French Art. I am having my mane powdered, my bow ironed, my nails polished, and, perhaps, I shall be able to wear my new blue 'waist-coat' ...
      The Courtauld lectures would be stimulating and important and I certainly think we should go to them. Have you any news of the plates in Hastings?
      Oh, by the way, yes, there is a bathroom in the annex.
      I love you so much and I cannot express how much I long for you. I am glad you had a talk with Tiny and if you want to start with a three-month arrangement I will agree. I adore you, by beautiful love. I shall go to Blackheath about next Monday. Will you come, dearest, not too long after that - say about the end of next week? I will tell you exactly when I will go shortly. The address is 109 Blackheath Park, Blackheath. If it were necessary for us to move in suddenly we could do so.
      I must fly to Observer office now. I love you
      Lawrence
