      2. I'm glad you so skilfully and silently protested about his generalization I hope to hear more of this lecture.

      I have given Clifford the P.C. and he says that he will give you a "dood" reference; "Where" he said, "I shall say I have so much confidence in him that I have ordered the Encyclopedia Britannica from him!"

      I am so glad about your poems. I hope, if, the weather permits, it start that painting of the cricket ground gate tomorrow.

      Clifford and I have bathed this afternoon - it was rather cold because of the north wind on the two previous days, but very pleasant once one was in, and nice for swimming.

      I must post this now.

      I love you
      Sylvia.

      P.S. I will return your Uiss. In a day or so. Tiny wants to read it.
      If you want it before tell me.

      2.  I'm glad you so skillfully and
      silently protested about his generalization
      I hope to hear more of this [unclear][/unclear].
      I have given Clifford the P.C.
      and he says the he will give
      you a a "dood" reference; "why"
      he said, "I shall say I have too
      much confidence in him that I have
      ordered the Encyclopedia Britannica
      from him!"
      I am so glad about your poems.
      I hope, if, the weather permits, it
      start that painting of the cracked
      ground gate tomorrow.
      Clifofrd and I have bathed this
      afternoon--it was rather cold
      because of the north wind on the
      two previous days, but very pleasant
      [unclear][/unclear] one was in, and nice for swimming.
      I must post this now.
      I love you
      Sylvia
      P.S.  I will return you [unclear][/unclear]
      a day or so.  Tiny wants to read it.
      If you want it before tell me.
