      Dearest Sylvia
      I adore your card - it did not come until after Xmas or I would have mentioned it before.  Its absolutely enchanting - a worthy addition to your gallery of fine cards.  Truly it ravished me.  The 3-D effect, the lace, the elves, the imagery in the heart - thank you so much - as you say - Viva 1954.
      I am sad you felt depressed over the holiday - I can scarcely believe it when I think of your great card - so lyrical and loving.  I am sure Dean cheered you.  You seem to have had an excellent Xmas - apart from your one mood.  The big game hunter sounds a riot.
      By the way, would you send me the [unclear][/unclear] address please.
      Thank you [unclear][/unclear] I detect New York influence don't you?
