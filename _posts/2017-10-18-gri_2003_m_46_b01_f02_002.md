      [unclear]  ??? was toes? [/unclear] there's no parcel post on Sunday. I delayed the letter because I wanter to finish the enclosed poems and also becauseI was in doubt about the important point. Albert has returned from Paris and I am going there with him at the end of this month for a good part of April. There was a faint chance going this Tuesday so I hesitated to write until I knew.
      I opposed this idea strongly because of your visit to London and have won. I should be away in the period of Easter - the 3 week break when there was in any case little hope of seeing you.

      break when there was, in any case, little hope of seeing you.<br/> Was Ditchling
      (or it is Ditchly, I don't remember and am not much concerned at a recurrence
      of the confusion) pleasant - at least inoffensive? I do hope so that going there
      Friday night (alas!) didn't make the week-end seem too  long. Although it is
      long since I saw you it is with terrible concern I realise anew that I am not
      to see you until Wednesday -  thee not alone<br/>[Monday and Tuesday are the
      mountains separating me from you & the triumphal train that will bring you on
      Wednesday.]<br/> One of the features of being alone which I don't think the
      writers have stressed enough is the feeling that one's acts of tenderness are
      incomplete, that I havn't shown enough how I love you, that everything is still
      to be done.
