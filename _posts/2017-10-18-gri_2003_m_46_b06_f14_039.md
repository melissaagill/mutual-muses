      to collect all the pictures including
      the Swin Collage ones and all the
      ones at Blackheath including the
      Pengilly one which you so kindly
      fetched. That will save the New
      Malden fare and us any more trouble!
      I need to do some tidying up of
      frames at Blackheath - and dust
      the pictures a bit! Also I have
      a lovely frame for Tiny Toto which
      I shall collect from Chase on Monday.
      (Then I shall be able to come to your
      lecture, and need not go to Swiss Cottage)
      I can then arrange with him to collect
      the pictures - sometime at the end of
      next week at your convenience.
           I hope you can meet me on
      Monday - I shall catch the 10-10
      to Liverpool St. It takes just
      over an hour and will arrive about
      11-20. I will let you know if I
      should not be coming on that, but
      that is a most convenient train and
      I meant to come as quickly as I can.

      I love you, my darling  This is [unclear]sweet[/unclear] butter from me  I love you
