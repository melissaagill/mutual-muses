      Pett
      Dearest Lawrence,
      I shall expect to see a very
      plump Lion when I come!  I hope
      that you keep it up!
      Tiny is better now--she had
      a cold coming on.  I don't feel very
      grand--frightfully tired and run down
      --the week man are in and I have
      a Witlow on the 3rd finger of my
      right hand.  So I think I won't come
      until the 6th & 7th.  Then I hope
      my period will be over and I shall feel
      better.  I shall go to Michael on the
      8th until the 12th when I shall go
      to my Aunt and be with you again
      on the 13th when I shall stay until
      the 16th-17th or 18th or even 19th!
      I'll see how things are with my work,
      and how this would suit you.  I hope
      these dates meet with your approval--
      I must now get some work done.
