      Here is a poem I have just made since writing
      the letter. It is dedicated to you of course:

      To a wishing well
      The hero came
      And could not give
      The well a name

      How catch its form
      Call it a girl
      With honest hands
      Cupped like a shell

      Call it a rose
      Where dawn had sinned
      Or a red leaf
      Folded by wind

      Is it the secret
      I sought all night
      And every guess
      He made was right
