      Dearest Lawrence,
      Thank you for your 3 letters - I must say I don't think much of the Wendy Coop episode - I should have thought if you could not have phoned her you could have dropt her a note saying, "please notice the paintings of my friend S.S for I think her an interesting painter" or something to that effect and she would have receieved it on the 2nd which would have been time enough. Nobody ever seems willing to use any influence on my behalf - so I get no where as it is the only way. Well the 8th and the 9th are the days that the work is to be collected - I shan't waste any money on it again. I will send you the paper as soon as I receive it.

      Dearest Lawrence,

      I must say I don't think much
      of the Wendy Coop episode -
      I should have thought if you
      could not have 'phoned her
      you could have adopt her a
      note saying, "please notice
      the paintings of my friend S.S.
      for I think her an interesting
      painter" or something to
      that effect and she would have
      received it on the 2nd which
      would have been time enough.
      No body ever seems willing
      to use any influence on
      my behalf, so I get no
      where as it is the only way,
      well the 8th and the 9th
      are the days that the work is

      Pett  4.1.52
      Dearest Lawrence,
      Thank you for your 3 letters. I must say I don't think much of the Wendy Coop episode - I should have thought if you could not have phoned her you could have [unclear]dropt[/unclear] her a note saying "please notice the paintings of my friend S.S. for I think her an interesting painter" or something to that effect and she would have received it on the 2nd which would have been time enough. No body ever seems willing to use any influence on my behalf - so I get nowhere as it is the only way. Well the 8th and the 9th are the days that the work is to be collected. I shan't waste any money on it again. I will send you the paper as soon as I receive it.
