      Thank you for your letter: I am so happy that you feel my love during our absence.

      Remember that it was Michael who first introduced the question of separation.  If he meant it or if he didn't it was not evidence of love as I understand it.  Either he meant it and was capable of leaving you or, if he did not mean it, he was simply using it as a weapon against you, something to batter and torment you into 'faithfulness'.  He has said it, not once, bur repeatedly.  However eloquent or desolate he is now do remember the situation devolves from him, just as originally his attitude to you led you to me.  He is the real enemy of love - not you: the complete reversal of a conventional judgement of the situation is, as you know, as Clifford surely knows, the truth.  The first real suggestion to destroy your love originated in Michael.

      meant it or if he didn''t it was not evidence of love as I understand it.  Either
      he meant it and was capable of leaving you or, if he did not mean it, he was
      simply using it as a weapon against you, something to batter and torment you
      into ''faithfulness''.  He has said it, not once, bur repeatedly.  However eloquent

      his attitude to you led you to me.  He is the real enemy of love - not you:
      the complete reversal of a conventional judgement of the situation is, as you
      know, as Clifford surely knows, the truth.  The first real suggestion to destroy
      your love originated in Michael.'
