      [25-10-53] Sunday Blackheath Dearest Sylvia
      Thank you so very much for the books about Pit-a-Pat and
      Tawny. They are absolutely wonderful - good drawings,
      good words, and so tempting to touch. The forgetful cat &
      the vain Lion: what wonderful characters. Oh I adored
      them. Thank you again. Where did you find them?

      I received your telegram and I'll see about the surveyor right away. If we don't hear tomorrow I shall call on Foster
      & Foster about your offer for 46. Should 46 not come into
      our possession I think Paddington is a wonderful idea. I
      will to to the agencies you mention if it is humanly possible.

      Good news about Miss Newsham and the Bath picture. I hope
      the Brunshulls make themselves useful at last. Do you think
      they will? How was the Rye artists?

      Apart from Harpenden & Banstead I have 2 lectures at the T.G.
      this week, and on Friday afternoon, the judging of Golds-
      miths' students work. I thought it was last Friday & cancelled
      it. So now I can do it after all.

      Tho' 5 lectures is not, I suppose, very heavy - I shall probably
      have a good deal of writing to do. I had a heavy mail on
      Saturday which included a letter from David Sylvester. He
      is editing a series of articles for Encounter and he wants me
      to do one. That'll mean about 30. Possibly the Klee
      symposium at the ICA may go into Encounter, also; so I
      have to get that ready quickly. Finally, I may be writing
      a survey of British Non-Figurative Art for the Italian
      periodical Arti Visive. The editor asked Paolozzi to
