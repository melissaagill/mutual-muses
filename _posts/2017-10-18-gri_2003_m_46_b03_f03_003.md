      were friendly and asked questions and I was
      in better form.  The next lecture to this
      group was due for the 14th but that is the
      day of my Hogarth lecture at Tunbridge Wells.
      So I rang Clare and exchanged lectures with
      him:  he's doing the photographers on the
      14th, I on the 7th, thus leaving me free
      for Tunbridge Wells.

        Charles has given me two school lect-
      ures tomorrow, at 10 and 1.45, to a youth-
      ful boys school.  Isn't he nice?  And
      some others, including a public one on a
      Saturday at end of the month.

        I a sorry this is so dry a letter but
      I thought the information in it might be
      re-assuring.  There's some more to come.

        John left the Arts Council yesterday but Miss Chick is
      taking over the draft of the exhibition
      so I expect to get my money soon as she is
      more business-like than John.  And the
      NS and N say there should be some books in
      for me next week.

        You are in my mind constantly, my con-
      stant beauty of whom I am so mindful, mir-
      rored in a multiplicity of beautiful and

      were friendly and asked questions and I was in better form. The next lecture to this group was due for the 14th but that is the day of my Hogarth lecture at Tunbridge Wells. So I rang Clare and exchanged lectures with him: he's doing the photographers on the 14th, I on the 7th, thus leaving me free for Tunbridge Wells.

      Charles has given me two school lectures tomorrow, at 10 and 1.45, to a youthful boys school. Isn't he nice? And some others, including a public one on a Saturday at end of the month.

      I am sorry this is so dry a letter but I thought the information in it might be re-assuring. There's some more to come.

      John left the Arts Council yesterday but Miss [Chuk][/unclear] is taking over the draft of the exhibition so I expect to get my money soon as she is more business-like than John. And the NS and N say there should be some books in for me next week.

      You are in my mind constantly, my constant beauty of whom I am so mindful, mirrored in a multiplicity of  beautiful and loving images. How I adore you, oh ravishing Sylvia,

      I adore you
