      To turn to more cheerful topics, here is a poem for you,
      my darling Muse:

      Trolls may live in sonnet's caves
      But stalactites of rhyme descend
      And stalamites ensure the end,
      Behind stone bars, of instinct's slaves.

      When miners find them like seven sleepers
      The agony above is over.
      You, miners, have resleased (take cover),
      The original chimney sweepers -

      Those ones climb the emperor's chimney
      As if it were a lift-shaft to all floors.
      Treasure and souvenirs are theirs.
      What they cannot eat they bury.

      Wild as they are while they slept we melted
      The glacier that froze
      The William Morris sunflowers.
      The caves are flooded now the trolls are putti

      It is about the id of lovers being released mutually and their
      pleasure making southern putti of Northern trolls - ives,
      thought Yawalla - like, give essential drives.
      I have to go in talk room about 'Painting as an Interrational
      Language' to some Quakers [unclear][/unclear] the N.G.
      I love you, Sylvia dearest, I love you
      Lawrence

      To turn to more cheerful topics, here is a poem for you, my darling muse:

      Trolls may live in sonnet's caves
      But stalactites of rhyme descend
      And stalamites ensure the end,
      Behind stone bars, of instincts slaves.

      When miners find them like seven sleepers
      The agony above is over.
      You, miners, have released (take cover),
      The original chimney sweepers -

      Those who climb the emperor's chimney
      As if it were a  lift shaft to all floors.
      Treasure and souvenirs are theirs.
      What they cannot eat they bury.

      Wild as they are while they slept we melted
      The glaciers that froze
      The William Harris sunflowers/
      The caves are flooded now the trolls are putti.

      It is about the id of lovers being released mutually and their pleasure making southern putti of Northern trolls - into, though Tawalla. like, give essential drives.

      I have to go to talk soon about 'Painting as an International language' to some Quakers visiting the N.G.

      I love you, Stylvia dearest, I love you
      Lawrence
