      4 Rue de Navarre   Paris V                    9 VII 1950

      Dearest Sylvia,

      Delightful as Paris is I wish I were not here alone, and wish you were with me. Having been here three days I feel so strongly what I said in another letter, that time is working now to reunite us. Opportunity is in a street, a square, a gallery, in Paris, his forelock ready to be grasped and he will return me to you.

      Yesterday I went again to the Orangerie and made many notes. This afternoon I am visiting again the Albertina collection which gives me, to think of it now, a pang for we saw it together in England.

      Peter and  met two intelligent American girls - both of whom have been students of Kokoschka and one of whom attended the lectures of Panofsky later reprinted in  [unclear]Studia 1[/unclear] and Iconology. She says he is a rather heavy man with a small, smart beard, a pointed one.

      Peter lives, by the way, in the district behind the Pantheon, slightly beyond the student section, in a rather residential bourgeois neighbourhood. His apartment is in a large block, as usual, and he has the same worries about [unclear]service[/unclear] he had in English blocks.

      If I may judge from the weather here you may well be able to paint your landscape from the church. I do hope so. It is warm but not, yet, stuffy, conditions I hope are shared by Pett. You are, of course, still at [unclear]Ditchley[/unclear]. How dull. Your return today will I am sure enable you to paint. I am gathering images for my poems which I will send you soon. My muse has given me images but not as yet the final guiding principle.

      Dearest Sylvia,
      Delighrful as Paris is I wish I were not here alone, and
      wish you were with me. Having been here these days I feel
      so strongly what I said in another letter, that Time is work-
      ing now to reunite us. Opportunity is in a street, a square,
      a gulley, in Paris, his forelock ready to be grasped & he
      will return me to you.
      Yesterday I went again to the Orangerie and made many
      notes. This afternoon I am visiting again the Albertina
      collection, which gives me, to think of it now, a pang for we
      saw it together in England.
      Peter and I met two intelligent American girls - both of
      whom have been students of [unclear]Kahoccha[/unclear] is one of whom attend-
      ed the lectures of Panofsky later reprinted in [unclear]Studia 12
      Iconology[/unclear].  She says he is a rather heavy man with a
      small, smart beard, a painted one.
      Peter lives, by the way, in the district behind the Pantheon,
      slightly beyond the student section, in a rather residential
      bourgeois neighbourhood. His appartment is in a large
      block as usual, & he has the same worries about [unclear]ver-
      min[/unclear] he had in English blocks.
      If I may judge from the weather here you may well be
      able to paint your landscape from the church. I do hope
      so. It is warm but not, yet, stuffy, conditions I hope
      are shared by Pett. You are, of course, still at Ditchling.
      How dull. Your return today will I am sure enable you
      to paint. I am gathering images for my poems which I
      will send you soon. My muse has given me images but not
      as yet the final guiding principle.

      4 Rue de Navarre Paris V   9 VII 1950
      Dearest Sylvia,
      Delightful as Paris is I wish I were not here alone, and wish you were with me. Having been here three days I feel so strongly what I said in another letter, that Time is working now to reunite us. Opportunity is in a street, a square, a gallery, in Paris, his forelock ready to be grasped & he will return me to you.
      Yesterday I went again to the Orangerie and made many notes. This afternoon I am visiting again the Albertina Collection which gives me, to think of it now, a pang for we saw it together in England.
      Peter and I met two intelligent American girls - both of whom have been students of Kahoscha & one of whom attended the lectures of Pavofsky later reprinted in Studies in Iconology. She says he is a rather heavy man with small, smarlt beard, a pointed one.
      Peter lives, by the way, in the district behind the Pantheon slightly beyond the student section, in a rather residential bourgeois neighbourhood. His apartment is in a large block as usual, & he has the same manner about service he had in English blocks.
      If I may judge from the weather here you may well be able to paint your landscape from the chuch. I do hope so. It is warm but not, yet, stuffy, conditions I hope are shared by Pett. You are, of course, still at Ditchley. How dull. Your return today will I am sure enable you to paint. I am gathering images for my poems which I will send you soon. My muse has give me images but not yet the final guiding principle.
