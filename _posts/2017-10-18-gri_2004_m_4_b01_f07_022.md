      PROLOGUE TO A PLAY

      Return, my Muse, the play awaits your hand.
      How can I write before I understand
      The action and the speech of characters;
      And dare we ask one of the younger actors *
      To stand upon his head, to get a laugh?
      I even fail to draw the loving youth,
      Legal-illegal hero of the play.
      I call him up; draws breath, but what to say?
      Where does Pomona enter - on the right?
      And should Vortumnus be against the light?
      How do they look or feel or act, the Cast?
      I cannot guess for, or, my Muse is lost.
      Decor unpainted, and the stage is empty.
      Is a canal a river or the sea?
      People the wings; illuminate the stage
      Where Cupid is to beat outnumbered Age.
      Unruly poet that I am I fear
      To write unaided will provoke a sneer:
      'What, does she then elope, the dunderhead,
      Before the household has retired to bed?'
      Ah, no, the brainless poet's is th' offense,
      The lyrical creature is devoid of stage-sense.
      Although I have the actors talking prose
      Whenever I nod someone picks a rose,
      Or sings a song about the trials of Psyche
      In a most impractible high key.
      Only the pompous doctor can I write,
      For your absence makes my no less trite.
      Return, my Muse: solitude we'll barter
      For our new Commedia dell'Arte.
