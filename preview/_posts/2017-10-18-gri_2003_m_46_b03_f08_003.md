      Melpomene and the Gamins
      (i) INTRODUCTION
      The marble corridor of allegory
      Is double-crossed with entrances and exits:
      Here statuesque inhabitants of the City
      Combat maenads never at a standstill.
      Chivalric towers of drapery
      May half-conceal the grandeur of exits:
      But somewhere a golden section in the City
      Excludes the pinnacles and brings Time to a standstill.
      (ii) INTRODUCTION
      Ivy on the Doric column,
      And who resides in the wings,
      Among what we can only call
      Pointed unangelic leaves?
      Ivy on the Doric arms
      Of the acting Greek who brings
      Redolence of the myth only to fall
      Tenderly twisted as fronds of breath.
      Ivy on the Doric calm:
      Pass the leaf to those who sing
      Of the present in the past, and all
      Amorous for the Doric wreaths.

      Exempt a scientific view of history,
