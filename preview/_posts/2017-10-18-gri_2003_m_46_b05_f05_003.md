      (ii) The Streets

      The lit quarter harlequins the walls
      Of buried houses: neon runs
      Where cornice rested, window opened.
      A female contour martyred in the glass
      Is not for transport though it is a leg:
      There is no dark enormous torso skied
      Of which this is the host. It is complete.
      Elsewhere there is a head and several limbs.

      Afocal harems of the street
      Windows that are nearer
      Than dark walls and balconies
      With light the shape of closing girls
      And furniture mixed in the lower trees.
      Windows are the navels of blurred girls
      Who pull near on hairs of memory.
      Blindness and day soothe the voyeur.

      There is no dark enormous torso skied
      Of which this is the host. It is complete.
      Elsewhere there is a head and several limbs.

      Afocal harems of the street
      Windows that are nearer
      Than dark walls and balconies
      With light the shape of closing girls
      And furniture mixed in the lower trees.
      Windows are the navels of blurred girls
      Who pull near on hairs of memory.
      Blindness and day soothe the voyeur.
