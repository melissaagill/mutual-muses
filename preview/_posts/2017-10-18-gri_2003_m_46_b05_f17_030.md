      Dearest Lawrence,
      Thank you for your letter, and
      thank you so much for taking my
      water-colours to Kensington - I think
      it is a good idea - perhaps you
      can find out who is reviewing the show.
      I feel awfully depressed to-day
      it is hot and heavy - perhaps
      that is why and I feel a
      bit tired. I painted this morning
      and this afternoon have cleaned out
      the sitting room - what depresses
      me is that I feel the Woods and
      I do not get on very well any
      more.
      Do bring "Sunset Boul-
      evard" to read to me.
