      Dearest Lawrence,
      Thank you for your letter and the poem - I like it very well it is most inventive - " The children [unclear]gug[/unclear] departed summer" is a charming conceit. I like also " Afar Ancestors what" - sombre but vital! I admire the form of both - but the autumn is particularly elegant - the last two verses forming leaves.
      I iwll let you know as soon as possible the day of my arrival. I can stay until the 18th. Tiny has her Christmas sale on Nov 20th and I shall help her with it I expect.
      I don't think you have really wasted your free time as you have been writing Madeleine's western. You always become worried when

      Dearest Lawrence,
      Thank you for your letter and
      the poem--I like it very well it
      is most inventive--"The children gay
      departed summer" is a charming
      conceit.  I like also "Afar Ancestors
      What"--somber but vital!  I admire
      the form of both--but the Autumn
      is particularly elegant--the last
      two verses forming leaves.
      I will let you know as soon as
      possible the day of my arrival.
      I can stay until the 18th.  Tiny
      has her Christmas sale on Nov. 20th
      and I shall help her with it I
      expect.
      I don't think you have really wast-
      ed your free time as you have
      been watching Madelaine's western.

      for your letter and the poem - I like it very well, it is most inventive - "the
      children  departed summer" is a charming conceit. I like also "After Ancestors
      What" - sombre but vital! I admire the form of both - but the Autumn is particularly
      elegant - the last two verses forming leaves.<br/><br/>I will let you know as
      soon as possible the day of my arrival. I can stay until the 18th. Tiny has
      her Christmas Sale on Nov. 20th and I shall help her with it I expect.<br/><br/>I
      don't think you have really wasted your free time as you have been writing Madelaine's
      western. You always become worried when
