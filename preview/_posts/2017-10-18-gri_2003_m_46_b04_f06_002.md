      Dearest Sylvia,
      It is 10.00 so I suppose you will have had time to recover from the dust & the cramp of the journey & meet the woods again, and have a meal.

      I love you so much and am rapturously happy to have, at last, taken you to a dance. I live, now, for the next one!
      How beautiful you were - and what a success with everybody you met. Oh dearest love, how proud I am of you.

      Since you were here I have written a 1,000 words for the film book: it is about SHE and called light on '[unclear]Sunzer[/unclear] Boule - vard". I have completed two dance rooms also, which I enclose.

      For dinner I had a salad (like M's on Friday night), vermicelli (cooked in butter
