      SESTINA: ONE

      Impudent putti come and go like clouds
      So that the sun, or a ring on your hand,
      Is hidden and revealed by turns, a ball
      Crossing the net across the court, a net
      Which is the folding drapery of love -
      The brilliant boy, the pupil of the sun.

      Astronomers of love we know the sun
      At solstice and at dawn and know the clouds
      Shapeless and shapely semblances of love:
      There is a sail for Cythere, two right hands,
      The bed of Cupid and his silver net,
      And moving all, like dancers at a ball.

      The wanton master, cheeks plumped like a ball,
      Agile and crudtie, is Venus' son
      Who orders (like a tapestry) the net
      That captivates his patrons, does not cloud
      Their liberty, see how they move their hands!
      But unifies them with each strand of love.

      Roses and hyacinths, prepared by love,
      Repair the past: your heart was like a ball
      Bouncing in caves of night, until the sun
      Burned for you, darling, flowers in my hand,
      Ensuring happiness after the clouds
      Were cancelled by Apollo's net.

      The dark dispelled by nets of night, another net,
      Made of our hari, spun by the God of Love,
      Lies softly on our shoulders as a cloud:
      For love attends to lovers on this ball
      Revolving round Copernicus's sun,
      The testament of love sighned by two hands.

      Over your beauty you admit my hand:
      Behaving happily in love we net
      The birds of pleasure, symbols of the sun,
      WHom we surrender to in acts of love:
      Frotuna may be balanced on a ball
      But the ball is Earth, solid in the clouds.

      Among this net of images, my love,
      See putti in the clouds like dancers at a Ball,
      And, status of the sun, the ring upon your hand.

      SESTINA: ONE

      Impudent putti come and go like clouds
      So that the sun, or a ring on your hand,
      Is hidden and revealed by turns, a ball
      Crossing the net across the court, a net
      Which is the folding drapery of love -
      The brilliant boy, the pupil of the sun.

      Astronomers of love we know the sun
      At solstice and at dawn and know the clouds
      Shapeless and shapely semblances of love:
      There is a sail for Cythera, two right hands,
      The bed of Cupid and his silver net,
      And moving all, like dancers at a ball.

      The wanton master, cheeks plumped like a ball,
      Agile and erudite, is Venus' son
      Who orders (like a tapestry) the net
      That captivates his patrons, does not cloud
      Their liberty, see how they move their hands!
      But unifies them with each strand of love.

      Roses and hyacinths, prepared by love,
      Repair the past: your heart was like a ball
      Bouncing in caves of night, until the sun
      Burned for you, darling, flowers in my hand,
      Ensuring happiness after the clouds
      Were cancelled by Apollo's net.

      The dark dispelled by nets of night, another net,
      Made of our hair, spun by the God of Love,
      Lies softly on our shoulders as a cloud:
      For love attends to lovers on this ball
      Revolving round Copernicus's sun,
      The testament of love signed by two hands.

      Over your beauty you admit my hand:
      Behaving happily in love we net
      The birds of pleasure, symbols of the sun,
      Whom we surrender to in acts of love:
      Fortuna may be balanced on a ball
      But the ball is Earth, solid in the clouds.

      Among this net of images, my love,
      See putti in the clouds like dancers at a Ball,
      And, statue of the sun, the ring upon your hand.

      January 1949
