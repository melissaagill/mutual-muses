      2 The Stoneware book is extremely useful about method. I hope to do notes on it this evening.
      I have asked Clifford about the Transitions and he says you may have them with pleasure. He was reading "the Orators" with great enthusiasm yesterday - he thinks Auden a master of language - and loves his remarks about the press. Clifford says he will write an homosexual play about a Lord Botherere!
      I am working on my oil from the attic window and this afternoon I have been down to the shore but as the tide was out and there was rather a strong wind I did not do as much as I had oped. However I haven't a great deal more to do.
