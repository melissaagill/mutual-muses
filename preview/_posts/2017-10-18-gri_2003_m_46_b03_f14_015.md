      Pelt

      Dearest Lawrence,

           I hope you had a pleasant journey and arrived safely.  We all thought of you and guessed where you would be.  Don't forget Notre Dame and Saint Chappelle.  We are all most envious.  It must all be charming- Do tell us all about it.  He sends you all the best.  Oh!  While I think of it- don't bother yourself about the easel - He says that type are very deal - about L10 - and I should hate to spend that on an easel - rather on canvases.  Thank you for sending the key it came this morning.  Also you would like to know - Teney collected the "Conversation Pieces" yesterday.  She and Michael - both had Lectures on Thursday Her audience appears to have been unin-spiring.  Though I'm sure that she herself was excellent.  Michael's lecture went very well - I imaging just over 30 people.
