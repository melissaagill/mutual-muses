      3 [unclear]Pins[/unclear] for 5/-, but perhaps that is silly - do you think him nice? I have asked Michael if he thinks there would be a sale for him.
      On Thursday I shall paint in the morning - and go to the sale in the afternoon - I do hope it is fine for you at Brighton anyway the Pavilion is always fun. I hope your father is feeling stronger.
      Desiree came for her lesson alright - and was obviously ashamed when she saw me for she went very red - but think I told you. None of us are going to take any notice of it, we want to be on good terms with her until June when she will take her exams and then I think go to her Dramatic School. - then she will not need us but can build up a circle of her
