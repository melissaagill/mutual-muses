      Wimbledon
      22 X 52
      Dearest Sylvia,
      I am staying to night at Wimbledon as I have to spend another day at the V and A tomorrow and you know what it is like travelling from Banstead.  16 people came tonight.  Of the other WEA classes, social history has collapsed, literature (Mrs Maron's husband - the Melville writer) is groggy; music thrives and so, thanks to Mrs Stanton and others, does Appreciation of Art.  Several new people.  Mrs Eiedles is away next week so Beryl has offered her house for that night.  More interior decoration to face.
      Lion has read two books following up the R. Doycle one:  Tenniel and Cruickshank.  The latter must have known Bosch and Brueghal and Tenniel knew all about the vagarenes:  the Duchess (in Alice) is [unclear]raid[/unclear] to be modelled on a grotesque head by Quentin Marrys.  Isn't Tenniel good at lions ('my goodness' as this lion says).

      23 X 52
      How did you sleep?  I slept well and I feel fresh and ready for 8 hours at the V and A with De Wint and the Blottesque (as Ruskin called his kind of watercolor).
      My parents have a spare alarm clock so I shall be able to read locals in time for my exalted luncheon appointment.  Hetty says 'this is my first lord lieutenant' and is going through all her veils.
      Tawalla's German is less than he hoped though he often says 'Himmell', 'Heil', 'Mein Gott, Mein Gott, what a bloody fine hat' and 'Ja'.  But this suggests - to [unclear]horch's[/unclear] discerning eye - something less than matey.  Don't you think.
      I received an American advertisement about Perspectives (you remember you read it to me from the TLS):  it has a different editor each number, Trilly, Blackman (very good), and so on.  Marienne Moore Cranelations of La Fontaine are promised:  it will be most interesting to see what she makes of them for she is herself a gifted [unclear]fabulist[/unclear].

      Wimbledon
      22 x 52
      Dearest Sylvia,
         I am staying the night at Wimbledon as I have to spend another day at the V and A tomorrow and you know what it is like travelling from Banstead. 16 people came tonight. Of the other WEA classes, social history has collapsed, literature (Mrs Maron's husband - the Melville writer) is groggy; music thrives and so, thanks to Mrs Stanton and others, does Appreciation of Art. Several new people. Mrs [unclear]Siedler[/unclear] is away next week so Beryl has offered her house for that night. More interior decoration to face.
         Lion has read two books following up the R. Daycle one : Tenniel and Cruikshank. The latter must have known Bosch and Brueghel and Tenniel knew all about the Nazarenes : the Duchess (in Alice) is said to be modelled on a grotesque head by Quentin Marrys. Isn't Tenniel good at lions (my goodness as this lion says).
                         23 x 52
         How did you sleep? I slept well and I feel fresh and ready for 8 hours at the V and A with De [unclear]Wint[/unclear] and the Blattesque (as Ruskin called his kind of watercolor).
         My parents have a spare alarm clock so I shall be able to read Lincoln in time for my exalted luncheon appointment. Hetty says 'this is my first Lord Lieutenant' and is going through all her veils.
         Yawolla's German is less than he hoped though he often says 'Himmell', 'Heil', 'Mein Gott, Mein Gott, what a bloody fine lad', and 'Ja'. But this suggests - to Lionel's discerning eye- something less than mastery. Don't you think.
         I received an American advertisement about Perspectives (you remember you read it to me from the TLS) : it has a different editor each number, Trilling, [unclear]Blackmun[/unclear] (very good), and so on. Marianne Moore translations of La Fontaine are promised : it will be most interesting to see what she makes of them for she is herself a gifted fabulist.
         The V and A is not exactly calling me but I am aware that it is waiting so lion must be off. Only a week until I see you my love

      Wimbledon, 22 X 52
      Dearest Sylvia,
      I am staying the night at Wimbledon as I have to spend another day at the V and A tomorrow and you know what it is like travelling from Banstead. 16 people came tonight. Of the other WEA classes, second history has collapsed, literature (Mrs Mason's husband - the Melville writer) is groggy; music thrives and so, thanks to Mrs Stanton and others, does appreciation of Art. Several new people. Mrs Siedle is away next week so Beryl has offered her house for that night. More interior decoration to face.
      Lion has read two books following up the R.Daycle one: Tenniel and Cruikshank. The latter must have known Bosch and Brueglel and Tenniel knew all about the vagarenes: the Duchess (in Alice) is said to be modelled on a grotesque head by Quentin Marrys. Isn't Tenniel good at lions ('my goodness' as this lion says).

      23 X 52
      How did you sleep? I slept well and I feel fresh and ready for 8 hours at the V and A with De Wint and the Blattesque (as Ruskin called his kind of watercaler).
      My parents have a spare alarm clock so I shall be able to read [unclear]Unals[/unclear] in time for my exalted luncheon appointment. Hetty says 'this is my first lord lieutenant' and is going through all her veils.
      Tawalla's German is less than he hoped  though he often says 'Himmell', 'Heil', 'Mein Gott, Mein Gott, what a bloody fine lat', and 'Ja'. But this suggests - to Lionel's discerning eye - something less than wanting. Don't you think.
      I received an American advertisement about Perspectine (you remember you read it to me from the TLS): it has a different editor each number, Trilling, Blachmus (very good) and so on. Marrienne  Moore translations of la Fontaine are promised: it will be most interesting to see what she makes of them for she is herself a gifted jabuliet.
      The V and A is not exactly calling me but I am aware that it is waiting so lion must be off. Only a week until I see you my love.
      Love you, Lawence
