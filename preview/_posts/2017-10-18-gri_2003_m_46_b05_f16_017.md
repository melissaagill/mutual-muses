      a long talk with Grace, and that you seemed cheerful and well which is delightful.

      On answer to your letter I'm afraid I have been over-working a bit, there's so much to do! But I'm so tired [unclear]nowithan[/unclear] I shall have to be more sensible! I hope you were pleased with the [unclear]Lain[/unclear] review.

      The [unclear]Loldes[/unclear] came and spoke to me in the [unclear]ins[/unclear] this morning - they asked me to go round - said we must [unclear]need[/unclear] well I shan't put myself out!

      I haven't done any painting - and I don't think I'll have time now - until after Easter - but I might manage on watercolours.

      How are you finances? When shall I some after Easter? I long to see you - my poet

      I love you,

      a long talk with Grace, and that you seemed cheerful and well which is delightful.

      In answer to your letter I'm afraid I have been over-working a bit - there's so much to do!  But I'm so tired now that I shall have to be more sensible!  I hope you were pleased with the [unclear]Lam[/unclear] review.

      The [unclear]Foldes[/unclear] came and spoke to me in the [unclear]'ons[/unclear] this morning - they asked me to go round - said we must meet.  Well, I shan't put myself out!

      I haven't done any painting - and I don't think I'll have time now or until after Easter - but I might manage a water colour.

      How are your finances? When shall I come after Easter?  I long to see you - my poet.

      I love you,
      Sylvia
