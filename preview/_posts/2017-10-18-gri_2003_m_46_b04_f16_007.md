      you for your letters. My only apology
      for not writing was because I
      painted like a [unclear]mad think[/unclear] Ruth
      and Wacko - I haven't yet succeed-
      ed very well with Ruth. We
      worked on her yesterday afternoon
      and she is coming again to-morrow.
      I worked on Wacko yesterday morn-
      ing, and all to-day - I hope
      to finish the figure to-morrow morning
      so far it is going extremely well.
      She is wearing my black taffeta
      evening dress with a little cape
      of the palest blue (towards turquoise)
      ostrich feathers. Sitting in the  [unclear]park-[/unclear]

      Pett. 4. 4. 51

      Dearest Lawrence
      I love you - dearest, darling, dandylion - I adore you. Thank you for your letters. My only apology for not writing was because I painted like a mad [unclear] thing[/unclear]. Ruth and Wacko - I haven't yet succeeded very well with Ruth - we worked on her yesterday afternoon and she is coming again tomorrow. I worked on Wacko yesterday morning, and all today - I hope to finish the figure tomorrow morning. So far it is going extremely well.  She is wearing my black taffeta evening dress with a little cape of the palest blue (towards turquoise) ostrich feathers. Sitting in the pink chair with the Regency side- board to her left.
      Another piece of news, rather unfortunate, I think our tenants
