      2 - it certainly is not apparent in his work - I don't know how I can find out Love - I don't remember any mention of it in the books about his early work that I read for my  honors paper.  I think it is a very fruitful suggestion.

           We had a telegram this afternoon today that one tenant is staying another month - which means, I suppose, until the 18th of November.  I must say I am always glad when people stay on!  I am not quite sure what I am going to do about S.Â£A yet - M. Or I may bring the pictures by train- or may come by car.  [unclear] I came I should say a day and a night with you.  I will let you know directly it is decided.

           M cut down my stretcher and to my great relief - put the canvas upon it.  I have now put in Joseph - but am having a little trouble with his head which will be somewhat mitigated now that the canvas is taught(?) I have almost finished
