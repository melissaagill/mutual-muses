      Rectory Lodge 3.12.52

      Dearest Lawrence,
      I am most interested to
      hear about the [unclear]Erhst[/unclear] show -
      and so glad you are to
      review it - I hope I see
      it and the V. and A. exhibition
      not to mention Barnard Castle.
      Georgie is having a party
      on the 20th of December -
      so if I am to come to London
      I should come before that date.
      How do your lectures go? I
      have a feeling that my poor
      Lion is broke! Anyway let me
      know the possibilities -
      Tiny and I enjoyed the show
      last night - the early comedies
      are good, so light, lucid
      and deliciously rational -
      the 2 young people who played
      Dolly and Phil were excellent
      the others were good with
