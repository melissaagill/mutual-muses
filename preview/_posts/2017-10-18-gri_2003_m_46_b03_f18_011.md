      3. We had a letter from our tenant
      to-day - he is going to stay until
      the 27th at least; probably
      until the 12th of Dec. which
      is all to the good. I will
      write - or call to see [unclear]Mrs.[/unclear] Miller
      when I am up again.
          I have nearly finished my cabbage
      pictures - or Bresica seedlings.
      I have done the newspaper,
      but shall repaint the background,
      to-day. I worked on Frankie's
      arm but it is still not right - the
      hand is very lumpy - [unclear]oh dear[/unclear]!
      I very much like your sketch of
      the Budapest picture - it is clear
      and has nice quality.
           Thank you so much for the stuff. I don't
      think there is any hurry for it. You
      could bring it down if you come - or
      I could on my next return.
      This Saturday M. & I are to go to see
      Georgie's efforts with the "Linden Tree"
      we are only staying the night -

      3, we had a letter from our tenant to-day - he is going to stay until the 27th at least; probably until the 12th of Dec. which is all to the good.  I will write - or call to see Mr Miller when I am up again.
      I have nearly finished my cabbage [unclear]pictures[/unclear] - or Bresica seedlings - I have done the newspaper - but shall repaint the background, to-day I worked on [unclear]Tsaulkie's[/unclear] hand is very lumpy - oh dear!
      I very much like your sketch of the Budabest picture - it is clear and has nice quality.
      Thank you so much for the stuff - I don't think there is any hurry for it - You could bring it down if you come - or I could on my next return. This Saturday M & ! are to go to see Georgies efforts with the "Linden Tree" we are only staying the night -
