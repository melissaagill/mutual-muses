      Elizabeth [unclear]Luttyres[/unclear] (you know - film music & 12-tone serious composer). We travelled home together & I had Ovaltine her & husband Edward Clark. She is very nice in a [unclear]manic[/unclear], sledge hammer fashion. (I put down my headache this morning more to her than to work.)

      How is Mrs. Hake? She knows, I supposed, that you, like the Woods, are leaving the district - even if the full details are withheld. Does you portrait of her go well?

      Today I have to go to [unclear]COID[/unclear], N.G., and V.A.M. for slides. What a BORE - especially as it is rather foggy. I am going to stay in Wimbledon tonight after Barnstead - so if you should need to reach me on Thursday morning you could ring me before 10:00.

      Take care of yourself my darling,

      Love you
      Lawrence
