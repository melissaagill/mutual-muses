      Blackheath
      1st August

      Dearest Sylvia

      I do hope that you are happy in the country and that the Woods are understanding. The weather, though fitful, is not unpleasant on the whole here; therefore I can imagine you bathing and, perhaps, painting. Am I right? I am glad Desiree is well - I am sure she will be pleased to see you again.

      Perhaps you would like some news of my film book. About a third is written. At the moment it stands like this :
      Key to the City (general survey)   CRIME FILMS
      D.O.A. (Individual analysis)                     "
      Clouded Yellow                                         "
      The Iron Age (general survey)         WESTERNS
      Winchester 75 (individual analysis)       "
      War Films (general survey)
      Orphee
      Champagne for Caesar
      Two unfinished articles are Shadow on Sunset Boulevard (actresses) and The Tragic Bluff. And, of course, The Third Man.

      The abstract paintings at the Gimpel are wretched. John and I stayed there for nearly two hours examining everything conscientiously : we could have spared ourselves the trouble. Pretentious, incompetent, half-baked. John much disliked a painting by Hamilton. Come to that, so did I. The so-called revival of abstract painting in Britain is fallacious.

      Today I will try and get you the lamp shade you want for your visitor. Is it alright to keep it till you come? It would be difficult top pack up but if you want to get on with it I will post it. By the way, my shoes came on Saturday : thank you very much. I have saved the string : Dandy undoing it ...

      Here is a piece of my play :
      Bananas of tar, January; wineglasses of rock, February; March : solemn balustrades of wine. So the year passes. April : valleys are where the wind leans her elbows. May : intolerant pergola of ostriches; June - the moon in a hay tenement. Pillow of vines : July. The skin of sunlight : August. Already September - hierarchy of bouquets. Look out : November, the black ogre, descending October's beanstalk. Propelling pencils of lace : December.

      Sylvia, my beauty, I adore you - I adore you,
      Lawrence

      Dearest Sylvia

      I do hope that you are happy in the country and that the Woods are understanding. The weather, though fitful, is not unpleasant on the whole, here; therefore I imagine you bathing and, perhaps, painting. Am I right? I am glad Desirée is wel- I am sure she will be pleased to see you again.

      Perhaps you would like some news of my film book. About a third is written. At the moment it stands like this:
         Key to the City (general survey)
         D.O.A. (Individual analysis)         }CRIME FILMS
         Clouded yellow

         The Iron Age (general survey)        }WESTERNS
         Winchester 75 (individual analysis)

         War Films (General survey)
         Orphée
         Champagne for Caesar
      Two unfinished articles are Shadow on Sunset Boulevard (actresses) and The Tragic Bluff. And, of course, The Third Man.

      The abstract paintings at Gimpel are wretched. John and I stayed there for nearly two hours examining everything conscientiously: we could have spared ourselves the trouble. Pretentious, incompetent, half-baked. John much disliked a painting by Hamilton. Come to that, so did I. The so-called revival of abstract painting in Britain is fallacious.

      Today I will try to get you the lamp shade you want for your visitor. Is it alright to keep it till you come? It would be difficult to pack up but if you want to get on with it I will post it. By the way, my shoes came on Saturday: thank you very much. I have saved the string: Dandy undoing it --> (note: here there are some drawings from Lawrence in the letter..)

      Here is a piece of my play:
      Bananas of tar, January; wineglasses of rock, February; March: solemn balustrades of wine. So the year passes. April: valleys are where the wind leans her elbows. May: intolerant pergola of ostrichs. June- the moon in a hay tenement. Pillow of vines: July. The skin of sunlight: August. Already September- hierarchy of bouquets. Look out: November, the black ogre, descending October's beanstalk. Propelling pencils of lace: December.

      Sylvia, my beauty, I adore you- I adore you,
