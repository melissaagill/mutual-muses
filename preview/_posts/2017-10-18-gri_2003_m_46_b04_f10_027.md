      Monday morning

      Dearest Sylvia

      I am on my way from visiting father (who will be home later this week) to lunching with Madeleine. I have drafted the extract of the Western for her. It may be a bit too naturalistic as the dialogue at the moment —but we'll see. There must, she tells me, be parts of John, Tony, Sandra, & myself. I think I shall appear briefly in the prologue as I am murdered; the rest of the play [unclear] slows [/unclear] me being [unclear] anergised [/unclear].

      Last night at Banstead was very enjoyable with Magda & Frank. Admirable tea, splendid drinks (but all the time), & a delicious dinner which included asparagus and a an [unclear] ? [/unclear] treatment of beetroot which was "out-of-this-world". And several hours of pleasant chatter—full of compliments and paradoxes.

      I wonder how you are, my dearest love. It is Monday morning. I hope it is nor too Monday morningish as Pett-all washing, duties, chores. Do you not miss Tiny, really, [unclear]?[/unclear] she has been rater silly, —not having her to talk to in between work? I know I shaved in your place. I moved in there with you. Sylvia,—I adore, adore you. Do you love me? Does the time we are apart wheel clumsy treacherous wooden homes into our city? Do note let in any wooden [unclear]?[/unclear], because I love you so much. Asence is a bad thing for us but I love you & long to be re-united with you. My dreams are intricate, [unclear]? [/unclear] as my night-side trespasses in my day-side. How I miss you.

      Love you

      Wimbledon Monday morning [22-10-51]

      Dearest Sylvia

      I am on my way from visiting Father (who will probably be home late
      this week) to lunching with Madeleine. I have drafted the 1st act
      of the Western for her. IC may be a bit too naturalistic as to dia-
      logue at the moment - but we'll see. There must, she tells me, be
      parts for John, Tony, Sandra, & myself. I think I shall appear briefly
      in the prologue: I am murdered; the rest of the play shows me
      being avenged.

      Last night at Banstead was very enjoyable with Magda &
      Frank. Admirable tea, splendid drinks (but all the time), &
      a delicious dinner which included asparagus and an [unclear][/unclear]-
      ian treatment of beetroot which was 'out-of-this-world.' And
      several hours of pleasant chatter - full of compliments and para-
      doxes.

      I wonder how you are, my dearest love. IC is Monday morn-
      ing. I hope it is not too Monday morningish at Pett - all
      washing, duties, chores. Do you not miss Tiny, really,
      tho' she has been rather silly, - not having her to talk to
      in between work? I know I should in your place. I
      would I were with you. Sylvia - I adore, adore you.
      Do you love me? Does the time we are apart wheel
      clumsy treacherous wooden horses into our city? Do
      not let in any woodedn doubts, because I love you so
      much. Absence is a bad thing for us but I love you &
      long to be re-united with you. My dream are intri-
      cate, troubled: my night-side trespasses on my day-side.
      How I miss you.

      I love you
      Lawrence
