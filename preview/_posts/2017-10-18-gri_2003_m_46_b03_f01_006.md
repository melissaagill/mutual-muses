      London
      23 January 1950
      My dearest Sylvia
      This letter, written uncomfortably at a public Post office, cannot be long, not as long as I would wish, not as long as my next letter will be, but I must send you my love. Perhaps you are not happy yourself so allow me to send you - not the melancholy I feel this evening - but the love which is constant and which is not dim-inished by my mood. The happiness you have given me - and the happiness you will give me again: at the moment I am posed between two such enviable states, thinking of you sadly but confidently.

      Instead of working much today, as perhaps I should have done, I went to Hampstead = the re-sult of my journey is with me now, gleaming on my hand, as I write to you. Although I did not make you entirely happy, perhaps, an this visit, my love for you is like the red stone in my ring, constant and firm.
      I hope that your journey yesterday was

      such [unclear]?[/unclear] states, thinking of you sadly but
      confidently.

      I instead of working much today, as perhaps I
      should have done, I went to [unclear]Wanstead[/unclear]: the re-
      sult of my journey is with me now, gleaming
      on my hand, as I write to you. Although I did not
      make you entirely happy, perhaps, on this visit,
      my love for you is like the red stone in my ring,

      London 23 January 1950
      My dearest Sylvia
      This letter,  written uncomfortably at a public Post office, cannot be long, not as long as I would wish, not as long as my next letter will  be, but I must send you my love. Perhaps you are not happy yourself so allow me to send you - not the melancholy I feel this evening - but the love which is constant and which is not diminished by my mood. The happiness you have given me - and the happiness you will  give me again: at the moment I am posed between two such enviable states, thinking of you sadly but confidently.
      Instead of washing much today, as perhaps I should have done, I went to Hampstead: the result of my journey is with me now, gleaming on my hand, as I write to you. Although I did not make you entirely happy, perhaps, on this visit, my love for you is like the red stone in my ring, constant and firm.
      I hope that your journey yesterday was
