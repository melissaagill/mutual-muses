      I bought my canvas which I shall prime this morning - I shalln't be able to paint until the afternoon as it is very misty.
      We had a pleasant evening with the Savages.  I think them very good hearted if gauche.  I am going in to paint "Frankies" portrait on the next dull afternoon - they think they will buy it!  I hope I do a good one.  George has been very helpful and useful to [unclear]me[/unclear] in his advice about business.
      Mrs [unclear]Flake[/unclear] wants to buy my picture.
      Clifford went off at six this morning, yester-day evening he seemed very cheerful.  The Woods asked tenderly after you.
      I hope all went well at Wimbledon and that you feel inspired to work at the weekend!
      I love you, my darling, my apollo, I adore you and think of you all the time - I wish I were with you and long to see you again - I love you I love you
