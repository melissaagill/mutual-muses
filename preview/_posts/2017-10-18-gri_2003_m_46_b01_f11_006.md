      me that the juniors were full of the
      lecture when they got back to school
      yesterday. I was very pleased. I told
      her my name and hope she may ask for me
      when she wants future lectures.
      Yesterday I spent an hour with the
      Cashier at Hodders and my income tax
      becomes less labyrinthine. I am going
      to see the Inspector of Taxes this after-
      noon. The Cashier rang up the Lefevre
      to get several details that had been om-
      itted from my leaving form. He had Mrs-
      Brooks looking up all the details she
      had left out. I was pleased as you may
      imagine...
      The Father will be at the Embassy
      theatre next week if the Woods are in-
      terested.
      Dearest, I love you so much. I think
      of you continually. I remember you in
      so many moods and poses, words and act-
      ions, I love you. Your variety de-
      lights me and leads my imagination a
      wonderful chase. I adore you so much.
      I have been thinking about my long

      I saw the Old Vic's Twelth Night last
      night: not very good I'm afraid. To-
      night I have my dance.
      I love you, dearest, I love you,

      got back to school<br/>yesterday. I was very pleased. I told<br/>her my name
      and hope she may ask for me<br/>when she wants future lectures.<br/>Yesterday
      I spent an hour with the<br/>Cashier at Hodders and my income tax<br/>becomes
      less labyrinthine. I am going<br/>to see the Inspector of Taxes this after-<br/>noon.
      The Cashier rang up the Lefevre<br/>to get several details that had been om-<br/>itted
      from my leaving form. He had Mrs-<br/>Brooks looking up all the details she<br/>had
      left out. I was pleased as you may<br/>imagine...<br/>The Father will be at
      the Embassy<br/>theatre next week if the Woods are in-<br/>terested.<br/>Dearest,
      I love you so much. I think<br/>of you continually. I remember you in<br/>so
      many moods and poses, words and act-<br/>ions, I love you. Your variety de-<br/>lights
      me and leads my imagination a<br/>wonderful chase. I adore you so much.<br/>I
      have been thinking about my long<br/>poem. I want it to be courteous and<br/>intimate,
      formal and luxurious. I shall<br/>start it in the new year.<br/>I saw the Old
      Vic''s Twelth Night last<br/>night: not very good I''m afraid. To-<br/>night
      I have my dance.<br/>I love you, dearest, I love you,<br/>Lawrence<br/>'
