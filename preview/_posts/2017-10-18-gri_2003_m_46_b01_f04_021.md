      tuesday

      Dearest Sylvia:

      I am so distressed to hear that your neuralgia is back.  I was afraid it might be when you said your neck ached after the examination.  All I can say is what you said to me in your nice letter which I received this morning - 'I hope you will rest and sleep well'.  And I see from the end of your letter that the walk to the sea with Michael has not made any difference.  Oh, Sylvia, I hope you are well by now.

      I am glad that The Rectory Umbrella helped with the journey and I need not tell you my feelings when you say you read it on Sunday morning instead of going to church.  Good.

      I had forgotten that Josette Day in part of La Belle at la Bete wore her hair in a ring-bun, x like yours.  And she has your hairline and neck.  It was wonderful to find these little confirmations outside the actual narrative which is full of congenial allusions.  I thought it poignant: the symbolised need of love in la bete.  Do you remember the duologues before the great fire in which the Courtier imperceptibly vanquishes the animal and then, later, in the glade, when a deer flashes, and up go his ears and his shoulders hunch...  And the symbolism when la belle observes him guzzling water and shaking himself: somehow Cocteau suggests the action might have shocked her and that it is important than it doesn't.  You see what is implied: compare it, solitary, animal, with her father's careful preparation before sipping the wine in the beast's palace, and the formal toast.  Oh, and lots more.

      I went to Little Stanmore church yesterday and really it was a treat.  Verrio (pupils of), Bellucci, and Laguerre - all are represented, and there is one of the proudest 18th century monuments I have ever seen - to the Duke of Chandos and his two wives.  A lot of the information in Whiffen's Stuart and Georgian Churches is incorrect, however, as long talks with the Verger proved.  He is a charming and witty old man and he tells a very funny story of some Swiss Girls he showed round the church recently.  They came to the Mausoleum which is half marble, half wood painted to resemble stone.  He banged on the wooden portion and (here he illustrated what he did) threw his voice most skillfully: 'what do you want' and old man's voice wheezed.  And then he scampered over to the other side of the room and banged again: 'Now what is it' another voice squeaked.  The Swiss girls are firmly believed now that there are re-

      x is that what it's called?
