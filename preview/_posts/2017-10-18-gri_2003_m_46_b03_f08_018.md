      Magazine and I found, at the Blackheath Bookshop, for 2s. the illustrated souvenir of the Italian exhibition at Burlington House in the '30s.

      You may remember laborers were covering the road with tar and pebbles: the paths, too, are being repaired, I'm glad to say. Terribly smart now, unlike many private roads.

      Dandy has shaved this morning so as not to shame the road: he had not for four days (see diagram).

      My ravishing creature, my beauty, I must close my letter now as it is after 10.00 and I must to town. I will write again, very soon. I love you and love to have your letters. I adore you

      Magazine and I found, at the Blackheath Bookshop, for
      2s. the illustrated souvenir of the Italian exhibition
      at Burlington House in the '30s.

      You may remember laborers were covering the road
      with tar and pebbles: the paths, too are being re-
      paired, I'm glad to say. Terribly smart now, unlike
      many private roads.

      Dandy has shaved this morning so as not to shame
      the road: he had not for four days (see diagram).

      My ravishing creature, my beauty, I must close my
      letter now as it is after 10.00 and I must to town.
      I will write again, very soon. I love you and love
      to have your letters. I adore you
      Lawrence

      P.S.
      The Petunia is dead-looking & droopy (& the carnation)
      but the begonia are flourishing. The new leaved one
      is a bit shapeless but still flowering. I water
      them regular.
