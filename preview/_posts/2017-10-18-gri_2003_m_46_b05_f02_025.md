      29 TAVISTOCK SQUARE LONDON WC 1

      Dearest Sylvia
      How I love you. Only a few days to
      Saturday. Oh I long to see you. What
      arrangements shall we make for Sat-
      urday?  (I am seeing my parents to-
      day and I shall see if they will not
      come to the Tate the following Satur-
      day. Then I will be free quicker to
      meet you.) If you come by 'bus
      it will reach Lewisham about 5.00.
      I could probably be there by then.
      If you come by train is there one
      about the same time in the afternoon?
      If possible I will meet you so you
      will not have the drag along the Black-
      heath Park alone.
      The I.C.A. last night was a flop.
