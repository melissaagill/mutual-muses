    clean_transcription: 3.12.51<br/>Pett<br/>Dearest Lawrence, I am rather<br/>sorry
      for the letter I sent<br/>yesterday - it is horrid to keep<br/>up recriminations
      - I'm so sorry.<br/>On the other hand perhaps it<br/>it better to tell you what
      I have<br/>been feeling. I feel calmer this<br/>morning. I love you so much<br/>and
      am morbidly over-anxious<br/>I think. I shall be alright when<br/>I see you
      I think - only say<br/>that you love me. I should<br/>be more gentle with our
      love - <br/>for as Clifford says - Love dies<br/>over-night - Hate seldom -
      but<br/>as you know though being over<br/>anxious one sometimes brings<br/>about
      what one most fears. I<br/>love you, I adore your, my poet,<br/>You are so important
      to me
