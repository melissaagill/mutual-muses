      Pett 9.1.52

      Dearest Lawrence
      Thank you for your letter and especially the exquisite poem. I read it to Tiny - it was too good not to share and she exclaimed with pleasure. My darling you are a Prince of Poets - my Laureate, Lawrence. I looked your name up the other day - it does come from Laurels - and has various other noble meanings.
      I love you so much - I love you so much - and I so much admire you - I think you are most noble and splendid my dearest one, my Lion.
      I'm glad your S. Oak lecture went off well - I am sure you charmed all the ladies easily!

      My darling you are a Prince
      of poets.  My Laureate, Lawrence.
      I looked your name up the
      other day--it does come from
      Laurels--and he's various
      other noble meanings.
      I love you so much.  I
      love you so much, and I
      so much admire you.  I think
      you are most noble and splendid
      my dearest one, my Lion.
      I'm glad your S. Oaks lecture
      went off well.  I am sure you
