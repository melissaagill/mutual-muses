      Elongated lights and changing columns
      Until a map of England
      Stops, torn, before the window:
      Moss hoods a cloister,
      Ropes of surf uncoil.
      Sunlight punctuates the mist the way
      A painted head rewards Winter's readers
      Turning ivory pages of a manuscript.

      Wunderkammer of sloping autumn:
      Kinds of smoke from chimneys, trees
      Like veins blown in the cloudy
      Glass stems of the sky
      Where there is an eye
      Big with illness, pouched with hills.
      Like astronomers dark lens
      The mist lets us look in that wide eye.

      Each fell leaf's a clue
      If you can read the crisp page.
      That cloud's an angel's gallstone.
      The revealed tree scaffolds a comet's tail.
      Green marble hill mounts a whale's teeth,
      Making a path a jaw bone.
      Sacrificial November,
      Fire is blood-precious.

      Rods of October
      Land November's books
      Old and slimy from immersion -
      Water trickles from the soft tongues.
      Apples are still sweet in some brown trees
      And children guy departed summer.
      The year is settling like a cart
      In November's longing night
      Which burning museums
      Cannot abrogate.

      Elongated lights and changing columns
      Until a map of England
      Steps, torn, before the window:
      Moss hoods a cloister,
      Ropes of surf uncoil.
      Sunlight punctuates the mist the way
      A painted head rewards Winter's readers
      Turning ivory pages of a manuscript.
      Wunderkammer of sloping autumn:
      Kinds of smoke from chimneys, trees
      Like veins blown in the cloudy
      Glass stems of the sky
      Where there is an eye
      Big with illness, pouched with hills.
      Like astronomers' dark lens
      The mist lets us look in the wide eye.
      Each fell leaf's a clue
      If you can read the crisp page.
      That cloud's an angel's gallstone.
      The revealed tree scaffolds a comet's tail.
      Green marble hill mounts a whale's teeth,
      Making a path a jaw bone.
      Sacrificial November,
      Fire is blood-precious.
      Rods of October
      Land November's books
      Old and slimy from immersion -
      Water trickles from the soft tongues.
