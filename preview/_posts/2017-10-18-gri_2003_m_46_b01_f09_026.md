      thank you for dinner last night, it was Kind and Dandylion enjoyed it enormously. I have made it look as if the dinner was kind: you were kind, and the dinner was nice. But you were nice too.
      i shall go on forever once I start fitting appreciate adjectives to you. I shouldn't mind but I have more to say.
        I hope your house will not be too dusty and that no work has piled up seriously in your absence. I hope too that you got away from London pleasantly - that is without a rush or forgetting anything.
        It is time to say what this whole letter has been waiting to express - that I love you. If my love seemed hard to believe yesterday remember that under the circumstances you have expressed a doubt as to mine. I am not exempt from fears. I love you. Sylvia, Sylvia.
      It will be hard for me not to hear your voice daily but I am glad I can ring you sometimes at Pett. I expect I shall ask for PRI 3234, or PETT 7968.
        We both have proof of each other's love. I only hope for more propitious circumstances. My love for you is solid and it is energetic. My libido, like yours, is not static or silent. i love you and long for your happiness. Oh, Sylvia, my dearest, I love you.
        I love you, only you.

      Thank you for dinner last night, it was kind and Dandylion enjoyed it enormously. I have made it look as if the dinner were kind: you were kind, and the dinner was nice. But you were nice too.  I shall go on forever once I start fitting appreciate adjectives to you. I shouldn't mind but I have more to say.

        I hope your house will not be too dusty and that no work has piled up seriously in your absence. I hope too that you got away from London pleasantly - that is without a rush or forgetting anything.

        It is time to say what this whole letter has been waiting to express - that I love you. If my love seemed hard to believe yesterday remember that under same circumtances you have expressed a doubt as to mine. I am not exampt from fears. I love you. Sylvia, Sylvia. It will be hard not to hear your voice daily but I am glad I can ring you sometime at Pett. I expect I shall ask for PRI 3234, or PETT 7968.

        We both have proof of each other's love. I only hope for more propitious circumtances. My love for you is solid and it is energetic. My libido, like yours is not static or silent. I love you and long for your happiness. Oh, Sylvia, my dearest, I love you.
       I love you, only you.
      Lawrence
