      Dearest Sylvia
      Thank you so much for your letter. I am
      glad that you feel better and I hope that your
      spirits will soon regain their proper level.
      (I am glad the Woods are, at any rate, nicer.)

      It is sweet of you to suggest that I come
      to Wales with you. I think it is a bold and
      delightful idea. I will write about it at
      great length in my next letter. This is
      just a express my appreciation of the idea.

      I have been lecturing this morning and
      I am on verge of seeing America in Paris.
      Then I shall return home.

      I am well except that I seem to be very
      tired. I shall be glad to get home after the
      film.

      No news except that I love you very
      much. Take care of yourself my love.
      I love you
      Lawrence

      glad that you feel better and I hope that your
      spirits will soon regain their proper level.
      (I am glad the Woods are, at any rate, nicer.)
      It is sweet of you to suggest that I come
      to Wales with you.  I think it is a bold and
      delightful idea.  I will write about it at
      greater length in my next letter.  This is
      just a express my appreciation of the idea.
      I have been lecturing this morning and
      I am on the verge of seeing America in Paris.
      Then I shall return home.
      I am well except that I seem to be very
      tired.  I shall be glad to get home after the
      film.
      No news except that I love you very
      much.  Take care of yourself my love.
      I love you
      Lawrence
