      THE SONG AT NIGHT

      In the sleepy cupola,
      Under ghosts of white mosaic,
      I dream the ear a landscape,
      A limestone honeycomb,
      Whose navigable streams
      Curve to memory
      Where I have stored
      The music of your voice.

      Out of the yielding hive
      Sleep leads a singer
      Who weeps until I wake,
      Whose words describe desire
      Complex and soft as limestone,
      Retentive as a cave.

      THE MODEL
      Shall statues of you at the city's corners,
      Monumental subjects for the open,
      Wear urban crowns, and regulated beasts
      Share the marble with you and be polychrome?

      In the gardens like crossing tapestries
      Shall there be statues of you holding flowers,
      Reclining in a grove, or bathing
      Under the woof of a silver waterfall?

      As table sculpture shall your flesh be modelled,
      In the tangled delicacy I adore,
      The pulse I chase in parting lips and thighs,
      And breasts the double of a cupid's bow?

      But no sculptor, formal or profane,
      But is defeated by your fund of beauty.

      THE SONG AT NIGHT

      The music of your voice.

      Out of the yielding hive
      Sleep leads a singer
      Who weeps until I wake,
      Whose words describe desire
      Complex and soft as limestone,
      Retentive as a cave.

      Shall statues of you at the city's corners,

      Weal urban crowns, and regulated beasts
