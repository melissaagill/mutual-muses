      WIMbledon 1967
      Today I am going to see John Skipp. Maybe a lecture or two will result. And I must write to Lines also. By the way in my Hogarth research I discovered some interesting facts about French criticism of the Venetians immediately preceding Watteau. Tell you when you come back.
      Fancy meeting C.T. in Paris. Ugh! I was very amused at your reversal of C.J.'s initials to J.C. I am tempted to do the same to C.T.'s and add a P at the end. He is, after all, so pink and newly scrubbed in appearance.
      You mention having an [unclear]aperitif[/unclear] with a view of the South elevation of Notre Dame. I adore that prospect across the river myself. [unclear]O the[/unclear] nostalgic emotions you do arouse.
      I must go out now to the V and A. They are keeping some books for me. I will write again immediately.
      I love you,
      Lawrence
