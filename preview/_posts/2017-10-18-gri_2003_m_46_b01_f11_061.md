      Dearest, I hope you are having a nice Christmas. I shall be plump I should think when we meet and how I long for that meeting, my rose, my muse, my love.

      Do come on the 5th and we will go North then.

      The three owls send their love and the two get on very well with their new friend whom I adore.

      Paul is back in London for a little while - it is nice to see him. He has a beard.

      Sylvia I love you, I love you,
