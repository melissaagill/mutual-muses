      1 December 1951
      Dearest Sylvia
      I am just having tea before returning home. One of the things I have intended to tell you in several letters but keep forgetting is something Madeleine told me. It appears that [unclear]Uhlwan[/unclear] is sueing Raynes-Barlam & Art News for the review of his show that appeared in the last issue. Barlam (whom Richard Conroy describes as 'an elephant on skates!) doubted Uhlwan's sincerity & stated that Freddie [unclear]'eytal' [/unclear] motive from other people. I have not heard if it is to be settled out of court, for for how much. The Renaissance & 1750-1820 English galleries and the new galleries devoted to 'painted porcellain' are really superb. The [unclear]ridness[/unclear] & resource of the collection really astonishes me. You must see them when you come next in London. After I had made out my lantern slide list I had a look round. Especially memorable to me personally was a giant Chinese wallpaper from Noor Park.
      I see from the newspapers this is to be a black X'mas. I am glad to hear it. White X'mas's have a double drawback. When the snow melts it is nasty underfoot  & the white market is, of course, ridiculously inadequate.
      Your illuminated poem is always in my hands, darling poet. I love you so much, & long to be with you. I am happy you are painting & feel lovingly disposed to me for I adore you
      Lawrence
      P.S. I am reading 3 Pirandello plays & Strindberg plays.

      several letters but keep forgettting<br/>is something Madeleine told me. It
      appears that Uhlwan is suing Rayner - Banlam & Art News for the review of his
      new show that<br/>appeared in the last issue. Banlan (whom Richard Conray des-<br/>cribed
      as '' an elephant on skates'') doubted Uhlman''s sincerity &<br/>stated that
      Freddie ''lytal'' motive from other people. I have<br/>not heard if it is to
      be settled out of court, nor for how much.<br/>The Renaissance & 1750-1820 England
      galleries and the new galleries<br/>denoted to ''painted porcellain'' are realy
      superb. The ridness<br/>& resource of the collection really astonishes me. You
      must see<br/>then when you come next in London. After I had made out my<br/>lantern
      slide list I had a look around. Especially memorable<br/>to me personally was
      a giant chinese wallpaper from Moor Park.<br/>I see from the newspaper: this
      is to be a black X''mas. I am<br/>glad to hear it. While X''mas''s have a double
      drawback. When<br/>the snow melts it is nasty underfoot & the white market is,
      of<br/>course,  inadequate.<br/>Your illuminated poem is always in my hands,
      darling poet.<br/>I love you so much, & long to be with you. I am happy you<br/>are
      painting & feel lovings  to me for I adore you<br/>Lawrence<br/> <br/>P.S. I
      am reading 3  plays & 8  plays.<br/>'
