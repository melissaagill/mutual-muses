      Dearest Lawrence,
      Thank you so much for the [unclear]Oschee[/unclear] article - I am so excited to have it and will take great care of it. I have not read it yet, I hope to this evening, and Clifford is going to read it to us all on Sunday.
      Today I have been working on the background of Carol's portrait. I hope to finish it today or tomorrow morning. Yesterday I worked on Ruth's dress in "the Flight", I think it is much improved - Michael has photographed it this morning I hope it will come out well.
      Carol has sent on a photograph.

    clean_transcription: Pett 5.4.51<br/>(Friday)<br/>Dearest Lawrence, <br/>Thank
      you so much for the Orphee article - I am so excited to have it and will take
      great care of it. I have not read it yet, I hope to this evening, and Clifford
      is going to read it to us all on Sunday.<br/>To-day I ahve been working on the
      background of Carol's portrait. I hope to finish it to-day or to-morrow morning.
      Yesterday I work on Ruth's dress in "the Flight", I think it is much improved
      - Michael has photographed this morning I hope it will come out well.<br/>Carol
      has sent off a photograph.
