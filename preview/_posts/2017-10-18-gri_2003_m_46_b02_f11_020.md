      Sunday - II-XII-1949      Durham

      Dearest, my dearest Sylvia,
         What a beautiful and happy metaphor have you placed at the close of your last letter and, perfect though it is, the long poem which seems to take its origin from your phrases, claims to be written; I mean your likening of your pictures to 'col-oured fruits' nourished by my sun.  You are yourself a poet for what a significant and lovely image it is - a crystalisation of one aspect of our love.  The only example of your art, the only fruit of your libido and your skill with me, is your tiny self-portrait, framed in its ruby setting, but this I often look at, like an early Shakespeare lover surrounded by sonnets, Renaissance imagery, and elegant landscape.
         Alas, the landscape is not conspicuously pastoral, in an agree-able sense, but all too naturalistic.  My journey here was through a winder world delicately and unevenly patterned with snow:  the fall had not been heavy and nowhere was the snow thick - green fans opening under every tree or bush.  From Redcor to Middle-sborough one traverses an incredible industrial landscape in which depression and disgust are less marked, in one observer, than an instinctive sense of wonder at this tangle of little rail-way lines, fabulous architecture, and great plateaus of rub-ble as twisted masses of dead stuff suggesting a landscape on the moon.  The moon was visible all morning - and it was an appropriate symbol of the climate, too.  From [unclear]Middlesboro[/unclear] to Durham the views, as I say, are wintery but non-industrial.  It took, altogether, in two buses, two and a quarter hours, but, at least, over the bus-driver's shoulder I saw the central tower.

      Alas, the landscape is not conspicuously pastoral, in an agreeable sense, but all too naturalistic.  My journey here was through a winter world delicately and unevenly patterned with snow: the fall had not been heavy and nowhere was the snow thick - green fans opening under every tree or bush.  From Redcar to Middlesbrough one traverses an incredible industrial landscape in which depression and disgust are less marked, as one observes, than an instinctive sense of wonder at this tangle of little railway lines, fabulous architecture, and great plateaux of rubble on twisted masses of dead stuff suggesting a landscape on the moon.  The moon was visible all morning - and it was an appropriate symbol of the climate, too.  From Middlesbro' to Durham the views, as I say, were wintery but non-industrial.

      Durham
      Sunday - 11-XII-1949
      Dearest, my dearest Sylvia,
      What a beautiful and happy metaphor have you placed at the close of your last letter and, perfect though it is, the long poem which seems to take its origin from your phrases, claims to be written; I mean your likening of your pictures to 'coloured fruits' nourished by my sun.  You are yourself a poet for what a significant and lovely image it is - a crystalisation of one aspect of our love.  The only example of your art, the only fruit of your libido and your [unclear]shell[/unclear] with me is your tiny self-portrait, framed in its ruby setting, but this I often look at, like an early Shakespeare lover surrounded by sonnets, Renaissance imagery, and elegant landscape.
      Alas, the landscape is not conspicuously pastoral, in an agreeable sense, but all too naturalistic.  My journey here was through a winter world delicately and unevenly patterned with snow: the fall had not been heavy and nowhere was the snow thick - green fans opening under every tree or bush.  From Redcor to Middlesborough one traverses an incredible industrial landscape in which depression and disgust are less marked, [unclear]in[/unclear] one observes, than an instinctive sense of wonder at this tangle of little railway lines, fabulous architecture, and great plateaus of rubble or twisted masses of dead stuff suggesting a landscape on the moon.  The moon was visible all morning - and it was an appropriate symbol of the climate, too.  From Middleboro to [unclear]Durham[/unclear] the views, as I say, were wintery but non-industrial.  It took, altogether, in two buses, two and a quarter hours, but, at last, over the bus-driver's shoulder I saw the central tower.
