      I miss you so much, my love -
      it seems loaded with gloom here with-
      out you - Tiny is in a whats it all
      for mood as usual - why
      on earth can't people try - to make
      the bear of it - she's not in too
      bad a position - it's not good
      suffering for others! In some way
      you're very sensible, at least you know
      how to enjoy yourself most of the
      time - though you do try to avoid
      everything unpleasant - which sometimes
      leads to something worse! All the
      same I adore you and wonder what
      my life would have been without you.
      I'm very happy about my show.
      I love you so much,
      I love you
      Sylvia
