      Pett 7.4.51
      Dearest Lawrence,
      Thank you for your letter - I did
      not think that I had missed
      more than one day - but I
      seem to be in a whirl of paint-
      ing and Carolyn - I wonder how
      you like your photograph?
      I think Ruth is the Flight is
      enormously improved - I am very
      pleased with the whole thing.
      I have finished painting Carol herself
      and have only to finish the side-
      board with the still life
      thereon.
      I'm glad that you enjoyed the
      party - and sorry about the pup-
      pets for they can be so amusing.
      As for what Madeline told Paul
      I never heard such Balls and
      I am more angry to  hear such
      nonsense than I was at my
      original rejection.
