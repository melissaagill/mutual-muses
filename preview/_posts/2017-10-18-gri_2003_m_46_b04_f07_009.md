      Hotel de l'Avenir
      Rue Gai-Lussac
      Paris V
      Monday
      i
      Lying on a double bed I write
      A letter to Sylvia whose mouth
      is lovelier than all the flowers
      The wall paper uses as bait

      ii
      On Saturday afternoon I read Proust
      On an iron chair in the Tuileries
      Well I reflected Spring is here at last

      iii
      (A LOCKET) Taken of the heart
      Heart-shaped bearing a head
      Thus a portrait can resolve
      The old imaginary war

      iv
      Now that islands and compasses and paddles
      litter the width of the embrace between us
      I enlist numerous fish
      From the aquarium of poetry and send
      To you with messages

      like bottles from a shipwrecked poet they will come
      up from the green lather and the pale horizon
      A marine banquet
      With very fin I would caress you and embrace
      you until the octopus

      v
      In the sea-shell's pocket
      On the unopened book
      Memory guards
      What can't escape

      A letter to Sylvia whose mouth
      Is lovlier than all the flowers
      The wall paper uses at bait

      ii
      On Saturday afternoon I read Proust
      On an iron chair in the Tuileries
      Well I reflected Spring is here at last

      iii
      (A LOCKET) Taken of the heart
      Heart-shaped hearing a head
      Thus a portrait can resolve
      The old imaginary war

      iv
      Now that islands and compasses and paddles
      Cities the width of the embrace between us
      I enlist numerous fish
      From the aquarium of poetry and send
      To you with messages

      Like bottles from a shipwrecked poet they will come
      Up from the green lathes and the pale horizon
      A marine bouquet
      WIth every fin I would carress you and embrace
      You with the octupus

      v
      In the sea-shells pocket
      On the unopened book
      Memory guards
      What can't escape
