                     PAINTING OUT OF DOORS III

      box in one hand and my brush in the other. I painted as quickly as I was able, racing time and the demolisher's picks, envel-oped, from time to time, as the steam trains passed, in smoke and smuts. Passers-by naturally paused to look, some sil-ently and unobtrusively, others making comments to each other, or to me. The youthful part of the audience always seemed to be surprised and delighted at being able to recognise my subject.

      It was then, for the first time, that I began to ponder, and consider as an interesting problem, the thoughts and expectations of these on-lookers. More often than not they seem rather dis-appointed, which is certainly not surprising, particularly if the work is only just begun; but it does suggest that they were ex-pecting something - that they had some preconscious idea of how the painting should look. I have tried to put myself in thier place, to guess at what is expected. Is it a neat, easily recog-nisable reproduction of the Brewery, for example, or an enchant-ing vision of the building, burning and gleaming with colour and light, rising like a Venetian Palace from the glittering waters of the Thames?

      The artistry and technique of the painter should satisfact-orily control and contain the main features and diversity of the scene, opening the spectator's eyes to things hitherto unobserved and unrealized. Thus the forces of wind and water, sun and earth, the elements enveloping landscape and architecture, the one-time gods of our ancestors, should be implicitly expressed and overcome by means of brush and paint and held on the canvas for our admiration.

      The artistry and the technique of the painter should satisfactorily control and contain the main features and diversity of the scene, opening the spectators' eyes to things  hitherto unobserved  and unrealized. Thus the forces of wind and water, sun and earth, the elements enveloping landscape and architecture, the one-time gods of our ancestors, should be implicitly expressed and overcome by means of brush and paint and held on canvas for our admiration.
