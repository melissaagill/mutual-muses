      The Childhood of the Poet
      Was there a king dead in the waste lot
      Among the derelict boards of trespassers,
      The tyres and rusty cans, the puddles
      That break like glasses at attacking weather.
      Was there a king and was he dead when I left?

      How many assassins ended on dry boards?
      One who might have known the fire-escapes.
      The tropic island at the time-bomb moment,
      Dies on the cracked and lengthwise boards
      As if he were split milk in a cafe.

      Was there a half-casts drowned at high-tide?
      Her body disintegrates in long
      Undulent tunnels of undefined span
      Or is islands patient as coral
      Under the uneventful outside of the sea.

      Was there a virgin buried in the avalanche?
      When the stones buried her perhaps they buried
      The entrance of a mine in the defile,
      Hid a window box and a tennis court
      From the sight of her lover on the hill.

      How many poets perished at my hands?
      Their bodies melting like snowmen
      Into the papers that might have held poems,
      Or stifled at the bottom of the bed
      Like lions beneath the stone feet of a knight.

      Was there a princess suffocated here?
      The suites that might have sacrificed her age
      And made a paradise by paradox
      Will never happen for historians
      Who might have prospered on her exquisite crimes.

      Was there a singer sighed to extinction?
      Is she more, who might have serenaded
      Princes tiny behind their open glasses?
      Empty the stage and unthrown the roses.
      The voluptuous gestures are curtained.

      Was there a here I triumphed over
      And only just in time?  When I stood up,
      Panting a little, wind crowded me
      Like ovoid cudgels or spitting cupidons.
      I had to run and fix my passport fast.

      The Childhood of the POET

      Was there a king dead in the waste lot
      Among the derelict boards of trespassers,
      The tyres and rusty cans, the puddles
      That break like glasses at attacking weather.
      Was there a king and was he head when I left?

      How many assassins ended on dry boards?
      One who might have known the fire-escapes,
      The tropic island at the time-bomb moment,
      Dies on the cracked and lengthwise boards
      As if he were spilt milk in a cafe.

      Was there a half-caste drowned at high-tide?
      Her body disintegrates in long
      Undulant tunnels of undefined span
      Or is islands patient as coral
      Under the uneventful outside of the sea.

      Was there a virgin buried in the avalanche?
      When the stones buried her perhaps they buried
      The entrance of a mine in the defile,
      Hid a window box and a tennis court
      From the sight of her lover on the hill.

      How many posts perished at my hands?
      Their bodies melting like snowmen
      Into the papers that might have held poems,
      Or stifled at the bottom of the bed
      Like lions beneath the stone feet of a knight.

      Was there a princess suffocated here?
      The suites that might have sacrificed her age
      And made a paradise by paradox
      Will never happen for historians
      Who might have prospered on her exquisite crimes.

      Was there a singer sighed to extinction?
      Is she more, who might have serenaded
      Princes tiny behind their opera glasses?
      Empty the stage and unthrown the roses.
      The voluptous gestures are curtained.

      Was there a hero I triumphed over
      And only just in time? When I stood up,
      Panting a little, wind crowded me
      Like avoid cudgels or spitting cupidons.
      I had to run and fix my passport fast.
