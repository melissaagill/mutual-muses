      admire'. In vain have I said: 'she's very different to me' and similar warnings. Evasions are becoming more strained and I at last had to say 'You must meet her some time' and he jumped at it. Eventually I shall have to manage it: what do you say to lunch at the salad bowl? At least no Father that way. I am furious with Johnson for prying like this despite my reserve. It also shows up the need for escaping 11 Mansel Road. I have not quite finished with him. He's nearly ill. He says his doctor has told him that 'nerves' are the matter with him. Familiar and meaningless enough but J. hints disquietingly at physical symptoms also. His eternal disappearances at the N.G., the Vega, and back at the N.G. all within the space of one hour are one manifestation and the other I don't know. Advancing age is on him too I fancy. If he does not relax and stop lunching, teaing, dining, with pupils, aunts, and lame dogs, I fear a crisis. Too late for Dr. Flugel to do any good, of course.

      I envy you another Lady From Shanghii.

      Did I tell you that Mandy (my cousin) offered me a bag of sweets, as I thought, the other day. I put my fingers in and drew out a - rose petal. Also she recites The Owl and the Pussy Cat amusingly (elegant fowl comes out very funnily) and it is nice to have her say that poem, so much of which is appropriate to us.
