      Blackheath         10  8  50

      Dearest Sylvia,
         I told Hetty of your dream and she blushed and said you must have heard it from Charles ("they are always talking), but, she said, there is no  truth in the rumor.  We must be responding in the same way in present occasions for I am having a sequence of dreams which are disturbing.  I remember them only fragmentarily but I keep losing you, in a large block of French apartments, in a landscape, in a tangled mannerist figure composition.  Tonight I think I shall go late to bed because the early nights I have had since you left seem incompatible with sleep.  Last night I saw the Maggawate (spelling?) tower, bluely illuminated, at 9.14.  I thought of you as I always do when passing the to-be-painted building.
         I have not yet seen Charles, to talk about Hogarth but I will tell you when I do.
         Today I am going to the N.G. to make notes for German Painting on Saturday.  Yesterday's lecture (Jacope di Lione, Sgrolo Taddi, Pisanello, Wilton Oiptigel) was I think successful - full of sociology & definitions of gothic, as well as formal analysis.
         A letter from Miss Click this morning asks me to lecture for a week in the Northern Region at the beginning of November.   Redcor, Whitley, Hartlegood, & Middlesbrough.  The subject everywhere 'The Work of the Public:  how to look at Pictures'.  I shall write a note after this, accepting gleefully.
          A light carnation has appeared, so that although I have cut off a dead one it is still fine and ample.
         I love you so much and long for you with an inducretion that shocks my super-ego, my beauty.  I am so glad Clifford gave you an encouraging lecture as I seem unable to.  I love you, my dearest creature.  I shall think of you all day in the Gallery.
           I love you
