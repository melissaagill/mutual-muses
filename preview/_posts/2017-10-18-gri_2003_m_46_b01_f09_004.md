      Because stags jump in the tapestries
      And the hunters embrace in the magic grove
      And I see your hair unfolded in a glass
      Falling about your breasts, wild and profane,
      I sacrifice the past where I have lived.
      Now ferns are growing on the landing stage.

      The past is martyred. I can only yawn.
      You are the vase desire fills, nourishing
      Flowers oblivious to the Autumn,
      Images which draw my scattered senses
      Toward your body and intelligence.
      The beasts of love are hunted by our kiss

      Because stags jump in the tapestries
      And the hunters embrace in the magic grove
      And I see your hair unfolded in a glass
      Falling about your breasts, wild and profane,
      I sacrifice the past where I have lived.
      Now ferns are growing on the landing stage.

      The past is martyred. I can only yawn.
      You are the rare desire fills, nourishing
      Flowers oblivious to the Autumn,
      Images which draw my scattered senses
      Toward your body and intelligence.
      The beasts of love are hunted by our kiss
