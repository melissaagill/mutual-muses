      29-12-52 Pett Dearest Lawrence,
      I so much enjoyed your article that
      I am more than ever sorry to hear
      about "Paybill" how disappointing
      for I fully believe that you could
      have resesitated it. Anyway I
      much admire the note paper.
      I so hope your mother gives
      you plenty of chocalates! I am so
      glad that your "lectures" show such
      pleasant appreciation. I had a
      thank you note from Charles and Madge,
      of my "original" card - they had al-
      ready sent me one - I have not
      had one from Chase though - or Richard!
      I hope you had my card - I
      had your poem on Christmas Eve - I
      read it with great pleasure today
      again - I do like it. I had
      your last letter dated 24 hr posted
      27th this morning - I hope you
      have had mine. I have bought my
