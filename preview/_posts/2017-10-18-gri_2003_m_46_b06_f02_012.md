      Blackheath
      4 ii 1953

      Dearest Sylvia,

      I am so sorry that you are still in bed and it is distressing
      news that your chest is still uncomfortable. Do be careful
      of yourself. But I can see that you are being careful (you
      must be well for your show) from your decision not to travel
      before 19th. I am terribly sorry that you will not be with
      me as soon as you hoped and as soon as I hoped. That is a
      vile thing to happen. However, I can see that you must, on
      no account, get behind with your framing: everything having
      to be prepared by the 19th. Do not go out more than is absolutely
      essential as the weather is stinking.

      By the way, you did not tell me the price of the Still Life
      with Chianti Bottle so I took it upon myself to price it at
      12 guineas, which seemed to be in scale with the other prices.
      I hope that is about right?

      Here is a poem for you: no title, yet.

        The rhetoric of lovers is their breath.
        Skin is their orator and harlequin
        Whose words are jumps, whose dancing is a speech.

        Taking a body as a sign of love
        Who listens hears the tumult of the skin,
        Limb alphabet and visceral tidings.

        The north-south which-way delta of the nerves
        Supports the purpose of the landing swan:
        Leda as you, wings as your eyes, and mine.

        Be eloquent by being as you are.

      I saw Charles and he is going to take me to The 7 Deadly Sins on
      Friday. Why is he so eager to take me to see this particular
      movie, I wonder? He seems to me to keep going to it... How-
      ever it is free, though not one of the best things in life.

      The galleries updates in the Tate (many of them) are being clear-
      ed for Mex. art. The permanent col. will be on view in the base-
      ment. However, the basement is cleared for fear of floods. So
      I may have to improvise hysterically on Thursday and Saturday as
      at present none of the Impressionist or School of Paris works (my
      two subjects) are on view...

      I am lunching with Anthony Hill (at his place). Then Banstead.

      I love you dearest Sylvia, I love love love you,
      Lawrence

      4 ii 1953 Blackheath Dearest Sylvia,

      I am so sorry that you are still in bed and it is distressing
      news that your chest is still uncomfortabe. Do be careful
      of yourself. But I can see that you are being carful (you
      must be well for your show) from your decision not to travel
      before 19th. I am terribly sorry that you will not be with
      me as soon as you hoped and as soon as I hoped. That is a
      vile thing to happen. However, I can see that you must, on
      no account, get behind with your framing: everything having
      to be prepared by 19th. Well I look forward very impatiently
      indeed to the 19th. Do not go out more than is absolutely
      essential as the weather is stinking.

      By the way, you did not tell me the price of the Still Life
      with Chianti Bottle so I took it upon myself to price it at
      12 guineas, which seemed to be in scale with the other prices.
      I hope that is about right?

      Here is a poem for you: no title, yet.

      The rhetoric of lovers is their breath.
      Skin is their orator and harlequin
      Whose words are jumps, whose dancing is a speech.

      Taking a body as a sign of love
      Who listens hears the tumult of the skin,
      Limb alphabet and visceral tidings.

      The north-south which-way delta of the nerves
      Supports the purpose of the landing swan:
      Leda as you, wings as your eyes, and mine.

      Be eloquent by being as your are.

      I saw Charles and he is going to take me to The 7 Deadly Dins on
      Friday. Why is he so eager to take me to see this particular
      movie, I wonder? He seems to me to keep going to it... How-
      ever it is free, though not one of the best things in life.

      The galleries upstairs in the Tate (many of them) are being clear-
      ed for Mex. art. The permaent col. will be on view in the base-
      ment. However, the basement is cleared for fear of floods. So
      at present none of the Impressionist or School of Paris works (my
      two subjects) are on view...

      I am lunching with Antony Hill (at his place). Then Banstead.

      I love you dearest Sylvia, I love you love you,

      you are still in bed and it is distressing news that your chest is still uncomfortable.
      Do be careful of yourself. But I can see that you are being careful (you must
      be well for your show) from your decision not to travel before 19th. I am terribly
      sorry that you will not be with me as soon as you hoped and as soon as I hoped.
      That is a vile thing to happen. However, I can see that you must, on no account,
      get behind with your framing: everything having to be prepared by 19th. Well
      I look forward very impatiently indeed to the 19th. Do not go out more than
      is absolutely essential as the weather is stinking. \nBy the way, you did not
      tell me the price of the Still Life  with Chianti Bottle so I took it upon myself
      to price it at 12 guineas, which seemed to be in scale with the other prices.
      I hope that is about right?\n\nHere is a poem for you: no title, yet.\n\nThe

      swan:\nLeda as you, wings as your eyes, and mind. \n\nBe eloquent by being as
      you are. \n\nI saw Charles and he is going to take me to The 7 Deadly Sins on
      Friday. Why is he so eager to take me to see this particular movie, I wonder?
      He seems to me to keep going to it...How-ever it is free, though not one of
      the best things in life. \n\nThe galleries upstairs in the Tate (many of them)
      are being clear-ed for Mex. art. The permanent col. will be on view in the basement.
      However, the basement is cleared for fear of floods. So I may have to improvise

      Blackheath
      4 ii 1953

      Dearest Sylvia,

      I am so sorry that you are still in bed and it is distressing news that your chest is still uncomfortable. Do be careful of yourself. But I can see that you are being careful (you must be well for your show) from your decision not to travel before 19th. I am terribly sorry that you will not be with me as soon as you hoped and as soon as I hoped. That is a vile thing to happen. However, I can see that you must,  on no account, get behind with your framing: everything having to be prepared by 19th. Well I look forward very impatiently indeed to the 19th. Do not go out more than is absolutely essential as the weather is stinking.

      By the way, you did not tell me the price of the Still Life with Chianti Bottle so I took it upon myself to price it at 12 guineas, which seemed to be in scale with the other prices. I hope that is about right?

      Here is a poem for you: no title, yet.

      The rhetoric of lovers is their breath.
      Skin is the orator and harlequin
      Whose words are jumps, whose dancing is a speech.

      Taking a body as a sign of love
      Who listens hears the tumult of the skin.
      Limb alphabet and visceral tidings.

      The north-south which-way delta of the nerves
      Supports the purpose of the landing swan:
      Leda as you, wings as your eyes, and mine.

      Be eloquent by being as you are.

      I saw Charles and he is going to take me to The 7 Deadly Sins on Friday. Why is he so eager to take me to see this particular movie, I wonder! He seems to me to keep going to it... However it is free, though not one of the best things in life.

      The galleries upstairs int he Tate (many of them) are being cleared for Mex. art. The permanent col. will be on view in the basement. However, the basement is cleared for fear of floods. So I may have to improvise hysterically on Thursday and Saturday as at present none of the Impressionist or School of Paris works (my two subjects) are on view...

      I am lunching with Anthony Hill (at his place). Then Banstead.

      I love you dearest Sylvia, I love love love you,
      Lawrence
