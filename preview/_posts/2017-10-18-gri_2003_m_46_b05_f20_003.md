      3. Tuesday
      Both Michael and George admired
      the "Golden Amulet" picture - I
      think that Michael was very much
      impressed for he thought it was a
      very difficult subject well solved.
      He has promised to help all he can
      with my show and is anxious to
      be there on the opening day if possible.
      He has also roughed out a very
      nice design for a card.
      I shall send you a sketch of "The
      Forge" in my next letter; and answer
      your letters more fully.
      I am longing to see you again -
      dearest Lion - my sweet love - answer
      quickly and clearly about dates!
      I love you, I adore you
      Sylvia
