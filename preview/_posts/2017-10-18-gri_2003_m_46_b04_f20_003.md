      about Miss Weil's article. I'm sure that should add some very interesting ideas

      sound extremely good. I very much look forward to seeing them. I did not think
      it necessary to take a library assistantship. Of course, I thought one might
      have an interesting job in one of the other departments. You don't really say
      whether you like the idea of the 7th or not. I should love to hear at least
      one of your lectures and perhaps go to one of the many exhibitions at the same

      3  close proximity of so many people.
      I am interested to hear about Miss
      Weil's article - I'm sure that should
      add some very interesting ideas to you.
      I think I need to put in the
      little table in Erica's portrait,
      but you shall see.
      I am very interested to hear
      of John's new painting they
      found extremely good. I very
      much look foreward to seeing them.
      I did not think it nessessary
      to take a library assistant
      of course - I thought one might
      have an interesting job in one of
      the other departments.
      You don't really say wether
      you like the idea of the 7th
      or not - I should love to hear
