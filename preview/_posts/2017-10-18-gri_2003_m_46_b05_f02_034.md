      My dearest Sylvia
      The day is pleasant: I walked along
      Blochheath Park very jauntily this
      afternoon, very different from the
      head-down, hands-in-pocket lion
      of the last months or so.  I am
      sure that it must be charming in
      Pett today- yet another en-
      ducement to my thoughts to keep
      turning to the Rectory. Oh my
      very dear love, now I adore you.
      I hope that your work goes well:
      believe me, my thoughts are never
      away from you for long.  Remember
      this as you garden (in gloves) or paint.

      Wimbledon
      20 11 1952

      My dearest Sylvia
      The day is pleasant: I walked along
      Blackheath Park very jauntingly this
      afternoon, very different from the
      head-down, hands-in-pocket lion
      of the last months or so. I am
      sure that it must be charming in
      Pelt today - yet another en-
      ducement to my thoughts to keep
      turning in the Rectory. Oh my
      very dear love, how I adore you.
      I hope that your work goes well:
      believe my, my thoughts are never
      away from you for long. Remember
      this as your garden (in gloves) or paint.
