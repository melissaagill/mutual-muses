    clean_transcription: I have finished my small still life and I am tinkering about
      with the frame! I shall work on the coutre-jone on this afternoon - I am doing
      a little washing in between writing this and hope to do some gardening before
      lunch. I have to take the compost from the orchard as its "pit" is quite full.
      <br/>I hope that you enjoy Blunt and the  review on Tuesday - you must tell
      me all about it - and all the gossip! I would like to come to your lecture on
      Cubism - Cushion!<br/>It is a lovely March day, windy sunny and quite mild -
      the japonica is coming out!<br/>I am longing to see you - write tell me dates
      of departure.<br/>I love you.<br/>Sylvia<br/><br/>P.S. I will bring my meat
      but eggs will be many fewer. S
