      [31-5-53] Sunday Blackheath: Dearest Sylvia:
      It was wonderful to see you again. It made me very
      happy. I only wish we could have been together all
      afternoon. Still - we got an extra hour when you
      missed your train. I do hope that it did not make
      you too tired when you finally got home. Did you get
      a Pett Level bus and walk up?

      Once again, congratulations about your two paintings
      being accepted. How well they looked in the show,
      pendant, and not separated. I am looking forward to
      the private view very much.

      Today I am staying in and writing. It is 11:00 and
      I have already done some more to the TV play, which I
      enclose. Then this afternoon I hope to work on the
      1st treatment of my sound play and the script of PRIVATE
      ROAD. I need to get these started as Frank and Magda -
      and, of course, John - are coming out here on Thursday.
      Pasmore is coming to coffee this evening at 9:00. It
      will make a nice break.

      I hope the Vogue Pattern Book was up to standard. Tell
      me anything new or charming in it, won't you? I went to
      Charleton House yesterday (which always makes me think
      of you), to the Library, and was pleased to find Parisan
      Reviews of this year and new Kenyon Reviews too, which I
      have barrowed.

      I have ideas for poems: one about the cinema beginning
      'The lake we fall in - eyes first'. And a poem for
      you starting 'All the music in a sigh'. But attractive
      as these seem to me I am going to write them after I
      have done my other work. One strong lion.

      I dreamed something about Paul S last night. I really
      must get in touch with him. I have not seen him since
      we entertained him together last time. I have been
      sleeping rather badly the last two nights. That's why
      I remember bits of my dreams, like that fragment.

      Remember me to Mrs Hake when you see her and give Beryl
      and George my love when you see them.

      I am waiting most impatiently to see you again, my love.

      I adore you, I love you

      Blackheath: Sunday

      Dearest Sylvia:
      It was wonderful to see you again. It made me very
      happy. I only wish we could have been together all
      afternoon. Still - we got an extra hour when you
      missed your train. I do hope that it did not make
      you too tired when you finally got home. Did you get
      a Pett Level bus and walk up?

      Once again, congratulations about your two paintings
      being accepted. How well they looked in the show,
      pendant and not separated. I am looking forward to
      the private view very much.

      Today I am staying in and writing. It is 11.00 and
      I have already done some more to the TV play, which I
      enclose. Then this afternoon I hope to work on the
      1st treatment of my sound play and the script of PRIVATE
      ROAD. I need to get these started as Frank and Magda -
      and, of course, John - are coming out here on Thursday.
      Pasmore is coming to coffee this evening at 9.00. It
      will make a nice break.

      I hope the Vogue Pattern Book was up to standard. Tell
      me anything new or charming in it, won't you? I went to
      Charleton House yesterday (which always makes me think
      of you), to the Library, and was pleased to find Partisan
      Reviews of this year and new Kenyon Reviews too, which I
      have borrowed.

      I have ideas for other poems: one about the cinema beginning
      'The lake we fall in - eyes first'. And a poem for
      you starting 'All music in a sigh'. But attractive
      as these seem to me I am going to write them after I
      have done my other work. One strong lion.

      I dreamed something about Paul S last night. I really
      must get in touch with him. I have not seem him since
