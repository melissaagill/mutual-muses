      2 that I can finish it over the weekend.
      I stayed with the Greenwoods a day longer and against my better judgement mainly because of the cold - my cold - it was a mistake.  John was very sore.  George was nice however, and gave me two dresses which no longer suite her - one is navy and white linen which suits me very well, the other is stone color and nigger jersy (wool) and I don't really like myself in brown.  However it is smart and useful.  Everyone has admired my hat.
      I'm so glad that your lectures went well - I hope Banstead did too.  I don't understand what you glimpsed at Petersfield - it looks like "exh."? Have you been exhibiting?!!
      I'm glad about Athene - that sounds interesting.
      By the way don't forget to chivy that vile parsons.
      I'm delighted to hear that you have no cold. Mine is nearly gone
