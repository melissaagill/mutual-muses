      6. the gloomiest possible view. Please
      don't think I blame you or critique
      you. For you have so many super-
      lative qualities one cannot expect
      perfection, and Clifford and Marjorie
      cannot say enough nice things about
      you, except that they think it
      would be very rash indeed
      for me to marry you.  Though they
      certainly do not think that I
      should be happy with Michael,
      and although I do not suppose
      that I should die if I gave you
      you - Life would hardly seem worth it.
      Michael, I think would like me back
      to live most - almost all, the time
      at Cambridge. He admits his past
      mistakes freely and says he thinks he
      has learned something from experience
