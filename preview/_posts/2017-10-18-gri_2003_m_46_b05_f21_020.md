      5    windy and cloudy with bright inter-
      vals.  I did the washing and tied
      up the tomatoes this morning as it
      was so dull.  Yesterday I picked
      d5lbs of blackberries for about an
      hour after lunch I think I shall
      do the same today and then work
      on a still life in the studio--
      the Spanish Legion and some
      pansies of thought--on and I
      must put in the flowers on the
      right of R&A.  Yesterday I finished
      the small sketch I was making of
      Pomona, and I have started a sketch
      of returnness.
      I'm glad that Molly is better, I'm
      sorry she is still not well.
      Let me know how long you can
      stay when you come--and I will
      make arrangements accordingly
      as far as possible.
      I do look forward is your
