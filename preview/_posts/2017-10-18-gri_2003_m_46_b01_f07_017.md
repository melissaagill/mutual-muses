      The pleasure of seeing Julian pictures in situ must be immense; how you will feel cheated by the bits of altarpieces to be seen in the N.G.  (A wave of the paw, a tilt of the wisher, is all you will have to spare for them now.)  In travelling you must appreciate with great clearness the differences be-tween school and school, in color, form and so on.  Florentine pictures in Florence, Sienese in Siena, and so on.  What an experience, supplementing the study of individual pictures!  And all the time the countryside behind the churches and museums.  Well, I suppose the masterly shorthand of J.C.'s sketches will tell me all about that...

      Emile Cammaerts has written an essay on Dobson, your Dobson, which I am saving for you.  They were selling off cheap, prints, quite big, of Patinir's River Scene at the N.G. so I have got one for you.  The artist in the foreground suggests all kinds of possibilities to me for a poem and I shall try and write something tonight.  But for the moment I must post this.  Time is short and I hope you will get this in Bologna by the 14th.  It is the 11th today.

      So it is I who must run for the post this time.  I love you.

      how you will feel cheated by the bite of altarpieces to be seen in the N.G.
      (A wave of the paw, a tilt of the whisker, is all you will have to spare for
      them now. In travelling you must appreciate with great clearness the differences
      be-<br/>tween school and school, in color, form and so on. Florentine pictures
      in Florence, Sienese in Siena, and so on. What an experience, supplementing
      the study of individual pictures! And all the time the countryside behind the
      churches and museums. Well, I suppose the masterly shorthand of J.C.'s sketches
      will tell me all about that...<br/><br/>Emile Cammaerts has written an essay
      on Dobson, your Dobson, which I am saving for you. They were selling off cheap
      prints, quite big, of Patinin's River Scene at the N.G. so I have got one for
      you. The artist in the foreground suggests all kinds of possibilities to me
      for a poem and I shall try and write something tonight. But for the moment I
      must post this. Time is short and I hope you will get this in Bologna by the
      14th. It is the 11th today.<br/><br/>So it is I who must run for the post this
      time. I love you.<br/>Lawrence
