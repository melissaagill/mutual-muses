      SYLVIA SLEIGH
      The people at Luton sound pleasant. At Clacton you describe, what is in essence a sea-side resident - (excepting Brighton - but, not altogether)

      I love the picture of "Dandy on the shore - I particularly admire the spaciousness of the composition - most masterly.  Dandy seems to be in a very grand car at Luton.

      No doubt Charles will have told you that his article has appeared in Art News with a rather bad "spiritualized" picture of him by Celia Bedford - I haven't brought myself to read the article yet though he always writes pleasantly
