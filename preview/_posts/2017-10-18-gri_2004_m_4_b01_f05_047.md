      Molly's party is tomorrow night.   I think I shall go - provided I feel well enough.  Last night and this morning I was not at all well but I seem to have recovered during the morning.

      I believe it will be rather difficult to get into A Street Car Named Desire because advance booking is up to 50,000 already!  So Paul told me.  Paul (and a Polish boy named Janic) and I went first to Shepherds & then to a terrifyingly bad plan horribly performed at the Guild Hall Theatre School last night.

      I am glad the Woods liked Daphne [unclear]Laursdale[/unclear].  The trouble with it is that Bridie is NOT an intellectual or a poet.  If he had more of Cocteau in his makeup he could be even more extravagant and yet more precise in his mythology.

      Yesterday Gainsborough and I had a long talk with ELT [unclear]Merens[/unclear].  You will be glad to hear that his "Merens') opinion of Erika (at the [unclear]Marones ??.[/unclear])  chimes with yours.  He called her 'a vicious girl'.  Girl?

      I love you so much  I think of you continually - my ravishing creature.

      I love you - Lawrence
