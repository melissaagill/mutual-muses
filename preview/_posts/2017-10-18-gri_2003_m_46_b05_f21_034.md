      Dearest Lawrence,
      I'm so glad to hear that you
      are better - I am too - nearly
      completely normal (!) tomorrow I
      shall be quite well. Do come as
      early as you can on Friday -
      Clifford may not come very early
      as he will probably have plenty of
      things to clear up at Harley Street.
      I wish you hadn't to go to Lincoln
      on the second of October - will
      you stay until the 1st then?
      I have nearly finished my landscapes
      and have just put in the sky in
      R. & A. and am putting in some
      flowers in the bottom right by your
      foot. I shall put in the landscape
      next week and "pull it all together".
      I wish I could come to your Lecture
      on Thursday - I think I had better
      not however as well as the money

      Pett 18.9.52
      Dearest Lawrence.
      I'm so glad to hear that you
      are better - I am too - nearly
      completely normal (!) to-morrow I
      shall be quite well. Do come as
      early as you can on Friday -
      Clifford may not come very early
      as he will probably have plenty of
      things to clean up at Harley Street.
      I wish you hadn't to go to Lincoln
      on the second of October - will
      you stay until the 1st then?
      I have nearly finished my landscape
      and have just put it in the Sky in
      R A and am putting in some
      flowers in the bottom right by your
      foot. I shall put in the landscape
      next week and "pull it all together".
      I wish I could come to your lecture
      on Thursday - I think I had better
      not however as well as the money
