      Blackheath
      Monday
      Dearest Sylvia:
      Yesterday, I did the work I hoped to and I have ahead of me another fairly busy day. [unclear]Radfern[/unclear], V and A, ICA (Michael), and finally [unclear]surhiton[/unclear] at 8.00 to lecture on the T.G. I am staying the night at Wimbledon as [unclear]Surhiton[/unclear] is in that direction. Tuesday evening CJ and Madge are taking me (on my [unclear]tecrer[/unclear]) to see Kind Hearts Coronets: I wish we were going together.
      I enjoyed my Turner lecture on his English pictures. I argued that the simple Nature period (Frosty Morning all that) was no more 'realistic' than views of Venice castles on the [unclear]Rhime[/unclear]. I found various expressive motives to support my ideas - and, anyway, I said, the whole of Turner's work is 'abstracted' from nature, so it is wrong to praise one period for realism only, as is costumary.

      Last night Mrs Harrison Mrs Williams had a great argument (on the stairs, of course): I gathered Mrs W is tired of the [unclear]workmen[/unclear] in the place did not want to leave her keys for them... Mrs H was, however, a rock.

      My new shoes are very comfortable, now.
      Well I must shave dress and throw myself on the town. Write soon, dearest creature.

      Love you
      Lawrence
