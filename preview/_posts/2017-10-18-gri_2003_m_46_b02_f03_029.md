When an artist is convicted of OEdipean sins against her, on go the black spectacles: all the tears of the artist's colour, all the legal claims of [unclear]line[/unclear], avail nothing.
      There are 25 pictures, 14 [unclear]darts[/unclear] containing 44 illustrations, and text. The average time going round is 15 - 20 mins.
