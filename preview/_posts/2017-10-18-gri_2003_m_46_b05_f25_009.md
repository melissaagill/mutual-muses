      two
      Pottery of memory, fired by fear,
      Be modelled by sunlight and local color:
      The centaur and the wizard shall be softened
      To the iconology of peace.
      The repose of rooms is evident
      By the symmetry of their collapse:
      The mirror is a placid ranch and now
      The anamorphic vision swivels down.
      Half of the salad of the year is segments
      Of the contours of repose, of orange
      Cool as columns supporting a blue pediment
      Inscribed with loving naturalistic figures.
      Here and on such steps as light exposes
      Morning is the profile of jardineres
      Filled with the spiral nipples of afternoon
      And the curled flags of the sensual night.
      We can embrace like figures in a double plot
      Across the loose-ends and the differences,
      On shelves cleared of books for the purpose,
      Or draped in a spider's web of stockings.
      Straw hats of summer spin through the window
      And rest on table, chairs, and corners of the bed.
      The large glowing eye of the lamp
      IN what moths mistake for stained glass lights.
      When I make sometimes the bed delays
      With the roses of the startled lovers,
      The perfume of the thoughtful, and the fish
      Leaping wild, uncovered, of the dream.
      Only in the message of pearls alive
      On girls who nourish pearls by their flesh
      Can I learn the peaceful heiroglyphs
      That personages carve on trees of sleep.
      Not masks but instruments the furniture,
      My map, my thebes, my sightly quarter,
      I am not the last alive, the only

      two

      Pottery of memory, fired by fear,
      Be modelled by sunlight and local colour:
      The centaur and the wizard shall be softened
      To the iconology of peace.

      The repose of rooms is evident
      By the symmetry of their collapse:
      The mirror is a placid ranch and now
      The anamorphic vision swivels down.

      Half of the salad of the year is segments
      Of the contours of repose, of orange
      Cool as columns supporting a blue pediment
      Inscribed with loving naturalistic figures.

      Here and on such steps as light exposes
      Morning is the profile of jardineres
      Filled with the spiral nipples of afternoon
      And the curled flags of the sensual night.

      We can embrace like figures in a double plot
      Across the loose-ends and the differences,
      On shelves cleared of books for the purpose,
      Or draped in a spider's web of stockings.

      Straw hats of summer spin through the window
      And rest on table, chairs, and corners of the bed.
      The large glowing eye of the lamp
      Is what moths mistake for stained glass lights.

      When I wake sometimes the bed delays
      With the roses of the startled lovers.
      The perfume of the thoughtful, and the fish
      Leaping wild, uncovered, of the dream.

      Only in the message of pearls alive
      On girls who nourish pearls by their flesh
      Can I learn the peaceful hieroglyphs
      That personages carve on trees of sleep.

      Not masks but instruments the furniture,
      My map, my thebes, my sightly quarter,
      I am not the last alive, the only
      Poet with woodwoses in the wings.

      Smooth as bubbles wandering in a drink
      The weather navigates the calendar:
      Vanishing trick of the unchivalric hunter,
      Restore the plates, the springs, the plenitude.

      two

      Pottery of memory, fired by fear,
      Be modelleed by nunklight and local color:
      The centaur and the wizard shall be softened
      To the iconoloby of peace.

      The repose of rooms is evident
      By the symmetry of their collapse:
      The mirror is a placid ranch and now
      The anamorphic vision swivels down.

      Half of the salad of the year is segments
      Of the contours of repose, of orange
      Cool as columns supporting a blue pediment
      Inscribed with loving naturalistic figures.

      Here and on such steps as light exposes
      Morning is the profile of jardineres
      Filled with the spiral nipples of afternoon
      And the curled flags of the sensual night.

      We can embrace like figures in a double plot
      Across the loose-ends and the differences,
      On shelves cleared of books for the purpose,
      Or draped in a spider's web of stockings.

      Straw hats of summer spin through the window
      And rest on table, chairs, and corners of the bed.
      The large glowing eye of the lamp
      Is what moths mistake for stained glass lights.

      When I wake sometimes the bed delays
      With the roses of the startled lovers,
      The perfume of the thoughtful, and the fish
      Leaping wild, uncovered, of the dream.

      Only in the message of pearls alive
      On girls who nourish pearls by their flesh
      Can I learn the peaceful hieroglyphs
      That personages carve on trees of sleep.

      Not masks but instruments the furniture,
      My map, my thebes, my sightly quarter,
      I am not the last alive, the only
      Poet with woodwoses in the wings.

      Smooth as bubbles wandering in a drink
      The weather navigates the calendar:
      Vanishing trick of the unchivalric hunter,
      Restore the plates, the springs, the plenitude.
