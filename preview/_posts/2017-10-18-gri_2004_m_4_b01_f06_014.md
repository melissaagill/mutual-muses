      In Burlington House

      Dearest Eylnia - my deal love,
      How happy you make me.   Your letter this morning - a pleasure I had not dared hope for - says exactly those things which I feel.   Hetty is already practicing the pose you want for her next portrait.  I love you, my darling, and am so happy that i make you as happy as you make me.   As your say in your letter, parting for a short time is less sad when we are so confident of our love.

      Lionel was about to send you a Henry Jamesion telegram of well-wishes for your lecture but Dandy thought the arrival of a yellow envelope might, however momentarily, discompose you.   So he contents himself with hoping that you will enjoy the lecture as much as your audience certainly will.  I long to hear your account of it.  Soon I shall hear you lecture again - a how I long to!
