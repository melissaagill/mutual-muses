      [7/3/48]

      11, Mansel Road, Wimbledon.

      Saturday,

      Dearest Sylvia,

      I'm writing this at [unclear]Mally's[/unclear], hence the corrected address above. [unclear]Charles[/unclear] is here, talking pleasantries about the state of the MSS of his book which is being typed now. I've not had an opportunity to ask her about bed set.

      You'll be glad to know that I spent all day at the V and A writing more than [unclear]really[/unclear] a sculpture & architecture essay, making notes for the mosaic stained [unclear]ears[/unclear] one. This, with yours, darling, I shall have three for [unclear]Clifton[/unclear] Taylor on Friday. Today's fog got into the V & A and gave Thames Embankment quality to the library and its rows of lights.
