      1st February 1949 Blackheath

      Dearest Sylvia,

      Thank you so much for your letter. Thank you too for your kind enquiries about last night: the lecture went quite well and the people seem to be interested. I am getting out of one Monday by taking them to the N.C. one day. Next week - Art and Society. Then Materials of the Artist. Audience is bourgeois, and moyen-ages (!).

      I agree with you about the flat in Aberdeen House and though I shall look round the antique shops I shall wait till you come more determindly than ever, my darling, my expert. I should like to give a Regency character to the room.

      I have read four chapters of Raphael and intend in the course of today to read as much as I can of the remaining 300 pages. It is really rather pretentious: sublime and Germanic. Howeber, I am learning things from it inevitably and my review shall be objective i think rather than infectious. We must go through the plates together when I've read the text.

      The Greenwoods would get no prize from me but, obviously you will have to delay for them. I hope to see you then on the 14th or 15th.

      I did send all the postcards and I will tell you my phone number, too, in case: LEE Green 0263.

      Here is the poem I read you: PASTORAL

      Beyond the apple and the kiss
      The world is wild and snakes hiss

      I think of Sylvia's sweet form
      On grass that Venus has made warm

      Let apples fall upon our heads
      We will eat them till we're dead

      Eat apples with me then and kiss
      The world is wild and the snakes hiss

      And here is one which I wrote yesterday.

      Missing, a Muse, shadows
      Hang on the curtain rail.
      An owl, solemn, prim,
      Adopts the mantlepiece.

      1st February 1949     Blackheath
      Dearest Sylvia,
           Thank you so much for your letter.  Thank you too for
      your kind inquiries about last night:  the lecture went
      quite well and the people seem to be interested.  I am
      getting out of Monday night by taking them to the N.G.
      one day.  Next week - Art and Society.  Then Materials
      of the Artist.  Audience is bourgeois, and moyen-ages (!).
           I agree with you about the flat in Aberdeen House and
      though I shall look round the antique shops I shall wait
      till you come more determinedly that ever, my darling, my
      expert.  I should like to give a Regency character to the
      room.
           I have read four chapters of Raphael and intend in the
      course of today to read as much as I can of the remaining
      300 pages.  It is really rather pretentious: sublime and
      Germanic.  However, I am learning things from it inevit-
      ably and my review shall be objective I think rather than
      infectious.  We must go through the plates together when
      I've read the text.
           The Greenwoods would get no prize from me but, obviously
      you will have to delay for them.  I hope to see you then
      on the 14th or 15th.
           I did send all the postcards and I will tell you my phone
      number, too, in case:  LEE Green 0263
      Here is the poem I read you:  PASTORAL
      Beyond the apple and the kiss
      The world is wild and snakes hiss

      I think of Sylvia's sweet form
      On grass that Venus has made warm

      Let apples fall upon our heads
      We will eat them till we're dead

      Eat apples with me then and kiss
      The world is wild and the snakes hiss

      And here is one which I wrote yesterday.

      Missing, a Muse, shadows
           Hang on the curtain rail.
      An owl, solemn, prim,
           Adopts the mantlepiece.
