      if I go I shall sketch the
      cliff--if not tomorrow morning!
      and RA today.  I hope
      to finish Clifford on Sunday after-
      noon.
      I hope your lectures go well to-
      morrow.
      I agree about our household--
      especially when you are there--
      I think in the future people will
      say "how wonderful to have known
      them just as I do of some
      writer of the past I greatly
      admire!
      I adore you.  I must get
      on now though.  September approaches.
      I love you
      Sylvia
