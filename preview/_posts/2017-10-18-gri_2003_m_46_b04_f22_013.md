      2 Is Mary [unclear][/unclear] favour again? I have given your address to [unclear]Jaumina[/unclear] and will give you hers. She came last weekend and was very pleasent. She is working for her [unclear]B.SC.[/unclear] wich I admire very much. She doesn't have much time but would be very good to go to some parties? or meet some young people. I wondered if Paul would like her? She's about his age. Anyway it would be nice if she could meet some people. I'm so sorry to hear about your father. I hope it won't be too uncomfortable.
      I like Dandy's formal portrait and his splendid new hat! It was so kind to send a telegram. I appreciate it, as Kay no doubt still says! I am so happy that you write so strongly of [unclear][/unclear] me. It makes me vey happy - like a sleepy cat in the sun - and that's what I feel like at the moment - the weather is glorious and I am
