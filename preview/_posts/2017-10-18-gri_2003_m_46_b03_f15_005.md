      I had a very uncomfortable journey, particularly at Luet as the old man on my left resented my intrusion, but the young man on my right was kinder and in this and they became more amenable.  The young man went as far as standing me a pint of mild at Pembury which was very welcome!
      [unclear]Ni[/unclear] met me and[unclear] Lung[/unclear] gave us [unclear]Deurlt[/unclear] asking kindly after you.  Clifford has all two classes fixed now which pleased him very much.  By the way - he thinks the Ehrenberg very brilliant, but does now think that he really orives gus case about wished[unclear] castrabies[/unclear] .
      In the afternoon, M. and I went to the shore - It wasn't so warm

      the young man on my right was kinder
      and in the end they became more am-

      which was very welcome!
