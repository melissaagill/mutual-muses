      64 St John's Rood Bathwick Bath Somerset
      23 IX 1948
      Dearest Sylvia,
      I am very glad that an arrangement has been reached and I look forward to the opportunity of discussing it with you. It seems cruel of Michael to keep you to himself in London considering he has you to himself in Pett as well. Do let us meet and talk alone, even if he does succeed in denying us more. But I remember what you hoped and I still hope. Do not upset your visit however for it.
      You must not feel guilty about your part in this situation - remember its origins. And for my part, I have not stoppped loving you, nor can I conceive of doing so. I am so happy at the strength of your love - though I regret the strain it causes you. I wish that I could be more help - but, you have all, all my love.
      Poor Sylvia, I wish things were more
