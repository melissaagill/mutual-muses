      2.45 I have painted the [unclear]neek[/unclear] and
      the spout of the jug after [unclear]rattier[/unclear] a
      struggle with the elipses but I have
      them right now. They are not perfect
      themselves - neither are the bauds of
      lustre round them. I have started
      on the body of the jug and hope
      to do a good deal more before it
      gets dark.
      Is the Blackhearts film show on Monday?
      Do tell me all about it - and how
      all your features go - what an accomp-
      lished Lion you are!
      I hear that Oxford won the boat race,
      isn't it amazing!
      Please could you send the [unclearwate?][/unclear]
      strap. The glass has come out and I can
      have all done together!
      I think of you all the time, my
      gracious creature and have a
      great longing to real all your poetry;
      which I shall do.
      I love you

      2.45.   I have painted the neck and the spout of the jug after rather a struggle with the elipses but I have them right now. They are not perfect themselves - neither are the bands of lustre round them. I have started on the body of the jug and hope to do a good deal more before it gets dark.
      Is the Blackheath film show on Monday? Do tell me all about it - and how all your lectures go - what an accomp-lished Lion you are!
      I hear that Oxford won the boat race, isn't it amazing!
      Please could you send the watch strap.The glass has come out and I can have all done together!
      I think of you all the time, my gracious handsome creature, and have a great longing to read all your poetry; which I shall do.
      I love you
      Sylvia.
