      Blackheath  4 X11 1952
      Dearest Sylvia
      I think you will be able to see all the exhibitions you mention for they are all on until X'mas and after (Ernst, Bowes Museum, V&A).  If you are going to Georgie's party on 20th you shall come to London before that.  As things are at present I have only two lectures that week.  TG on Thursday 18th, & TG on Sat. 20th.  From Sunday 14th onwards I have only those two lectures.  I will pay you back the money I owe you any time now and you will remember your last visit here was not expensive.  (Your feeling was right - I am broke.)
      So glad you liked the play: I agree with you, the early pieces are very pleasant indeed.  Fewer laborious & 2nd-rate ideas.  IC was the one about the Dentist you saw - wasn't it?
      Your dressing-table subject is going nicely by your accounts and it is good news that your portrait of Miss Campbell is successful, too.  Incidentally I will ring up Close this afternoon about your 2 oils.  Do not be shy about your name in my Kensington review - tho' I understand your feeling very well.  Do read it again.

      4 XII 1952 Blackheath Dearest Sylvia
      I think you will be able to see all the exhibition you
      mention for they are all on until X-mas and after (Ernst,
      Bowes Museum, V & A). If you are going to Georgie's
      party on 20th, you shall come to London before that.
      As things are at present, I have only two lectures that
      week. TG on Thursday 18th, & TG on Sat. 20th.
      From Sunday 14th onwards, I have only those two
      lectures. I will pay you back the money I owe you
      anytime now and you will remember your last
      visit hear was not expensive. (Your feeling
      was right - I am broke.)
      So glad you liked the play: I agree with you, the early
      pieces are very pleasant indeed. Fewer laborious &
      2nd - rate ideas. It was the one about the Dentist
      you saw - wasn't it?
      Your dressing-table subject is going nicely by your
      accounts and it is good news that your portrait of
      Miss Campbell is successful, too. Incidentally I
      will ring up Chase this afternoon about your 2 oils.
      Do not be shy about your name in my Kensington
      review - tho' I understand your feeling very well. Do
      read it again.
