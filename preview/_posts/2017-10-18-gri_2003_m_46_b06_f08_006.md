      Paul (Harding) has got a job on a ship and is now somewhere in
      the Mediterranian. He is what is called a writer, I think. He
      went about a week ago. It is rather a Jugue, I suppose, but he
      really has something to run away from. No Guys & Dolls to-
      night, therefore.

      I saw [unclear]Meseus[/unclear] at the ICA yesterday & he was, as usual, charming.
      He tells me that Picasso & Derain are rumored to have finished
      Rousseau's Sleeping Gipsy & that the 'rediscovered' La Querre
      may really be a Picasso [unclear][/unclear]. On the other hanbd, he had no real
      proof. TG gossip is entertaining, however.

      Well I must have lunch & go to town (the lecture's at 5:00).

      I love you so much. Look after your dear self.
      I adore you
      Lawrence.

      a week ago. It is rather a fugue, I suppose, but he really has something to
      run away from. No Guys & Dolls tonight, therefore.<br/>I saw  Meseus at the
      ICA yesterday & he was, as usual, charming. He tells me that Picasso & Derain
      are rumored to have finished Rousseau's Sleeping Gipsy & that the 'rediscovered'
      La Guerre may really be a Picasso pastiche. On the other hand, he had no real
      proof. The gossip is entertaining, however.<br/>Well I must have lunch & go
      to town (the lecture's at 5.00) I love you so much. Look after your dear self.<br/>I
      adore you<br/>Lawrence
