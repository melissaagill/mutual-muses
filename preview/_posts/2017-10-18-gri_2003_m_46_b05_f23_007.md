      are you giving a lecture? I expect the numbers were down on Saturday because you had not been lecturing!
      You are a buoy Lion, I'm glad Gainsborough is so friendly, and delighted to hear of the full page article on the winter ad Hilton. [unclear][/unclear] Philip's collection must be very interesting I look forward to seeing it.
      I have not yet finished my lecture - I have got to. Porcelain - I am not worried though - I feel I know it. I shall have time to waste in Hastings before my train so I shall go and look at some pots in Hastings Museum. I shall think of you lecturing on Turner - dear love.
