      [unclear][/unclear]Pelt[unclear][/unclear] 30-11-50

      Dearest Lawrence, I enclose the collecting order for my pictures at the Kensington could you possibly collect them on Saturday or Monday - I should be so grateful.
      I am disappointed about you cheques - I fondly imagined that you had £16 in hand - oh well - let me know. I am sorry too that you cannot come - but perhaps the fare is a little too much if you are in "straightened circumstances "! If I cannot come to you before the 8th do come to [unclear][/unclear]Pelt[unclear][/unclear] after. Our tenant thinks he will be gone by the 12th of Dec. but still is not sure. I shall write to Miller of the Redfern when I have more idea of my [unclear][/unclear]social[unclear][/unclear] in London (official)

      Pett 30.11.50

      Dearest Lawrence, I enclose the collecting
      order for my pictures at the Kensington
      could you possibly collect them on
      Saturday or Monday - I should
      be so grateful.

      I am disappointed about
      your cheques - I fondly imagined
      that you had 16 in hand - oh
      well - let me know. I am sorry
      too that you cannot come - but
      perhaps the fare is a little too
      much if you are in "straightened
      circumstances"! If I cannot come
      to you before the 8th do come to
      Pett after. Our tenant thinks he
      will be gone by the 12th of Dec.
      but still  is not sure.  I shall
      write to Miller of the Redfern when
      I have more idea of my arrival
      in London (official)
