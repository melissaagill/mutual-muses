      the other two in old age painting out-of-doors - but not such nice pictures I think - I wonder if you can think of a picture with an artist painting out-of-doors which would do? After all a painting would be better than photograph.
      Clifford read your article and found it very interesting - he has only one criticism to make - that 'Hanns Sachs' spells his name with 2 n's.
      I do hope you arrived home safely, and shall be very glad to hear from you - I expect you have had  to be very rushed on Friday and Saturday.
