      Superimposed on this your helmet hairstyle. Minerva. Sylvia, Sylvia. Minerva. In Prior Park were two coins, of Minerva on one, Apollo on the other: I remembered your [unclear]Eilnaze[/unclear] discovery. I looked at Minerva's neo-classic profile and thought how much I preferred her present incarnation. Oh, I adore you, I should like hire an aeroplane until [unclear]smoke[/unclear] above Pett - every morning at eleven - kisses and messages in the sky and drop you poems by parachute. Here are a few lines from my Batt poem about the Gothic earnings on the capitals in Wells:
      Gothic craftsman in the capitals
      like figures in a landscape with trees,
      shockingly close to monsters and loss,
      Bent grotesques, thorned with [unclear]toasts[/unclear] ache,
      Cringing and expostulating, lost
      To merely lyrical occasions.
      And this I am sure will amuse you. It is from Phantasmagoria by Carroll:
      "That narrow window, I expect
      serves but to let the dusk in - ".
      "But please", said I, "to recollect
      'Twas fashioned by an architect
      who pinned his [unclear]Laits[/unclear] on Ruskin!"
      Just writing to you has cheered me up. I love you.

I looked at Minerva's neo-classic profile and thought how much I preferred her present incarnation. Oh, I adore you. I should like to hire an aeroplane to write with smoke above [unclear][/unclear]- every morning at eleven - kisses and messages in the sky and drop you poems by parachute. There are a few lines from my Bath poem about all the Gothic carvings on the capitals in Wells:
      Gothic craftsmen in the capitals
      like figures in a landscape with trees,
      Shockingly those be monsters and loss,
      Bent grotesques, thorned with toothache,
      cringing and expostulating, lost
      To merely lyrical occasions.

      And this I am sure will amuse you. It is from Phantasmorgorie by Carroll:

      "That narrow window, I expect
      serves but to let the dusk in -"
      "But please, " said I," to recollect
      'Twas fashioned by an architect
      who pinned his faith on Ruskin!"
