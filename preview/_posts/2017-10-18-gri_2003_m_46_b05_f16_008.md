      Dearest Lawrence,
      Thank you so much for sending the
      watch-strap - it looks very well.
      I am most interested to to hear of
      the film show - I do wish I had seen
      it. I'm glad you liked the music of [unclear]Ferber[/unclear].
      I hope that he will [unclear]compose[/unclear] to more
      attractive artists next!
      I hope you enjoy Grace's lecture and the party.
      Yes do find out about White Chapel.
      I will save you the "Listener" and I'm
      very good to hear that you have some work
      from gainsborough - not much! I'm glad
      about the discussion at the I.C.A.
      Have you asked Gainsborough for you [unclear]Bogel[/unclear]
      Mss.? I hope you make up to C.C. if
      and when you have the opportunity for
      he would be very useful to us both.
      I have finished my still life of
      jugs - I am very pleased with it -
      I think I shall call it "Still-life for
