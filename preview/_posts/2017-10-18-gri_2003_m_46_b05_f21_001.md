      In the train 5.9.52

      Dearest Lawrence

      Having finished the review on Lesbia Beardon and dutifully read some of George's book - I shall start a letter to you for I can finish it this afternoon and hope that you will get it on Saturday. I do hope that you will manage to get the slides you want - and those before lunch. I hope also that your casual group will be easy to cope with. The sky is grey and it looks as if it may rain - I don't look forward to it going back! If it's wet however I may have "[unclear][/unclear] and [unclear][/unclear]" and to correct the large still life with the cupid. I see it is raining already - I hope it will not rain in town for you have to be out so long and have not even an umbrella. I think it will not last as there is a break
