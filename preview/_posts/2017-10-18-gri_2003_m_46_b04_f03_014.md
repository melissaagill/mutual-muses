      I am sorry that Kissing is rather a strug-
      gle but it is very complex. I am sure we will
      be rewarded when you have resolved it. I
      wait impatiently for news of it and of your
      oil of spring flowers. I am sure today's
      weather will further this project.
      Have you managed to machine your new
      suit yet. Hetty was delighted to hear
      that you had cut it out already. Dandy is
      dreaming of walking in the park in Spring with
      you dressed up. Ravishing creature, how
      I think and dream of you. Do send me a
      pattern of your material.
      World Review do not want the Welles'
      article. No TV news.
      What mark do you make on Tiny's
      map for Kissing Gates? I think it must
      be X X X X X X X X X X.
