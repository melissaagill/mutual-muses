      Pastorals in Hampton Court
      Or medieval morals
      Revive the primitive, or start
      Balances of man and animal.

      Fox, epitome of cunning,
      The bee, of industry.
      There, beyond the farmfence running.
      Near the Charterhouse making honey.

      A stir of satin and a flash
      Of sunlight on a clasp or bell.
      A monkey chatters but it is not trash.
      Ladies laugh at what he tells.

      Elephants and unicorns must live
      Both for themselves and homily.
      All beasts are free as well as captive
      In tales made up for the family.

      We condescend to owls who sit
      On the trees of !iterature
      Emblems of Minervan wit
      Losing their identity as creatures.

      Dead mice are epitaphs on stars.
      Sunrays catch the chimney pots
      Which fifteen minutes earlier
      The owl's wing grazing had found almost hot.

      The owl has made it just
      In time, to his ruin.
      After an entrance which raised the dust
      See him, now, his feathers settling.

      Back to barn and hollow tree and grot
      Owls go (great eyes learned in the half
      Tones of evening and midnight's blot),
      Lovely and strong by night at whom day laughs.

      This you may remember from two earlier poems: the form is better now.  I must stop now but I will pick up again tomorrow.  I love you so much. I am glad you miss me despite the varied attractions of Italy but I hope not too much.  I love you and will write again immediately.

      Pastoral in Hampton Court
      Or medieval morals
      Revive the primitive, or start
      Balances of man and animal.

      Fox, epitome of cunning,
      The bee, of industry.
      There, beyond the farmfence running.
      Near the Charterhouse making honey.

      A stir of satin and a flash
      Of sunlight on a clasp or bell.
      A monkey chatters but it is not trash.
      Ladies laugh at what he tells.

      Elephants and unicorns must live
      Both for themselves and homily.
      All beasts are free as well as captive
      In tales made up for the family.

      We condescend to owls who sit
      On the trees of literature
      Emblems of Minervan wit
      Losing their identity as creatures.

      Dead mice are epitaphs on stars.
      Sunrays catch the chimney pots
      Which fifteen minutes earlier
      The owl's wing grazing had found almost hot.

      The owl had made it just
      In time, to his ruin.
      After an entrance which raised the dust
      See him, now, his feathers settling.

      Back to barn and hollow tree and grot
      Owls go (great eyes learned in the half
      Tones of evening and midnight's blot),
      Lovely and strong by night at whom day laughs.

           This you may remember from two earlier poems: the
       form is better now. I must stop now but I will pick
      up again tomorrow. I love you so much. I am glad you miss me despite the varied attractions of Italy but
      I hope not too much. I love you and will write again immed-
      iately.
