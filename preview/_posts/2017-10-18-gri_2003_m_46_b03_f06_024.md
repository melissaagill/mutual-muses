      LATER
      This morning I got up early, before Peter awoke, had a
      cold shower, and went to the Luxembourg gardens where I breath-
      ed the voluptuous sweet flowers, admired the [unclear]curly clouds[/unclear],
      & [unclear]arrested[/unclear] my eyes from ([unclear]1910[/unclear] sculptures, particularly the
      Verlaine - a [unclear]Redonesque[/unclear], not Rodin-[unclear]laque[/unclear], [unclear]terror[/unclear]. I wrote
      the following poem, based on the contrast of silence & words,
      the idea that the poets' search for words is like the infants
      gradual acquisition of a vocabulary :
      [unclear]Tithing[/unclear] the flowers in the Luxembourg,
      Among the grey-degraded sculptures
      Official as a disappearance :
      Zinnia, Captain nan [unclear]sheet[/unclear],
      Nicochiana, dandylions.
      Delacroix's monumental palms
      Record the rigid grip of time.
      I [unclear]evaluted[/unclear] rusty chairs
      Float on [unclear]roathers[/unclear] legs not stand
      In a world that yields to sunlight.
      Reclining, reading, sitting
      We are suspended in a blaze of light
      That melts the solid steps and path
      Until we float among the named flowers.
      It is one lyric of a projected sequence.
      I love you, my dearest creature. I have been dismayed
      to find cats here are lead about on leads. My indignation knows
      no bounds. Is it not [unclear]shamable[/unclear]. But you, my cat, use your liberty so well, to paint, to inspire me, to be beautiful.
      I love you

      & averted my eyes from the (19th sculptures, particularly the
      Verlaine - a Redoneaque, not Rodin-esque, [unclear][/unclear].  I wrote
      the following poem, based on the contrast of silence, & words, the idea that the poet's search for  words is like the infants
      gradual acquirition of a vocabulary:
      Tilting the flowers in the Luxembourg,
      Among the grey - degraded sculptures
      Official as a disappearance:
      Zinnia, Captain non Fleet,
      Nicochiana, dandylions.
      Delocroisc's monumental palms
      Record the rigid grip of time.
      Invaluted rusty chairs
      Float on [unclear][/unclear] legs not stand
      In a world that yields to sunlight
      Reclining, reading, sitting
      We are suspended in a blaze of light
      That melts the solid steps and path
      Until we float among the named flowers.

      It is one lyric of a projected sequence.

      I love you, my dearest creature.  I have been dismayed
      to find cats here are lead about on leads.  My indignation knows
      no bounds.  Is it not shameful.  But you, my cat, use your
      liberty so well, to paint, to inspire me, to be beautiful -
      I love you
      Lawrence
