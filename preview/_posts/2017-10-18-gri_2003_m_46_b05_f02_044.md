      In return, please find enclosed, as
      they say, a cheque for a guinea. I have
      endorced it twice because of the mis-
      spelt name. I will let you have 2 more
      as soon as my cheques come.

      Paul and I saw Build My Gallows High and
      both enjoyed it very much again. It fits
      splendid into 'Key of the City': or should
      I, perhaps, say, my 'Key fits it?

      Today there is the special meeting at the
      I.C.A. about a film. I hope it's better than
      the last 'invitation only' occasion as I
      am going to town solely for it....
      A nice piece of [unclear][/unclear]: 'hood music' for
      modern music to which one does not dance.

      Apart from the one-night stand 'Abu Roi',
      Paul is stage-managing 'Princess Zanbar-
      ay again, this time at the Irving Theatre
      Club (like the Watergate - only upstairs).

      The cyclama has been in the window
      all the time, but I think it is dying.

      Look after yourself my rose - do not
      allow yourself to be plucked by anxiety.
      Await the summer at our next meeting. I love you
      Lawrence
