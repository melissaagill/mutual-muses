      At last I have a chance to write to you - sitting in the train at Southampton on my way back to town. I hope that you journey back to Pett on Wednesday was comfortable and, above all, that Tiny and Clifford made you feel welcome when you arrived. They are such an unstable pair - really weird in some ways - but they do love you very much in their eccentric wilful manner. I certainly hope that they are not upsetting at the moment. I am afraid several things have happened at once - your exhibition getting close, your exhaustion after painting so much at Woods' woods, mine, the feeling you should leave Pett, seeing your family again, M suggesting a house at Cambridge - it is really a formidable collection of disturbing problems.

      I told Palmer, curator of Southampton, about your exhibition and he said - 'do send me a card'. He has the gentles still life from the Oil Salem there 'on spec' at the moment - you remember it, huge, a little soggy. My lecture went very nicely, I think. 100 or so people, quite a lively discussion. The morning I saw some of the gallery's permanent col. - a Wright of Derby, Pasmore, Lariat tapestry, Turner, etc. It is a nice group of high standard. Some pictures are on loan there from Angus Wilson and somebody with a name like 'Odo Cross': they are parted from their pictures because they are in Jamaica, at present, so I fear Wilson will not be able to come to your show probably.

      I have no real idea of what Southampton is like for I arrived at night, spent the morning i the gallery, and left at 12.30. There is a vague sense of primly cleared bomb sites, new building of a suburban modernistic character, a king-size civic centre of the 30's, and, at night, sirens and boaters.

      27 February 1953

      Dearest Sylvia
         At last I have a chance to write to you in the train at Southampton on my way back to town.  I hope that your journey back on Wednesday was comfortable and, above all, that Tiny and Clifford made you feel welcome when you arrived.  They are such an unstable pair - really wierd in some ways - but they do love you very much in their eccentric [unclear]niljot[/unclear] manner.  I certainly hope that they are not upsetting at the moment.  I am afraid several things have happened at once - your exhibition getting close, your exhaustion after painting so much, the Wood's moods, mine, the feeling you should leave Pett, seeing your family again, M suggesting a course at Cambridge - it is really a formidable collection of disturbing problems.
         I told Palmer, curator of Southampton, about your exhibition and he said - 'do send me a card'.  He has the [unclear]Gestler[/unclear] still-life from the Oil Salon there 'on spec.' at the moment - you remember it, huge, a little soggy.  My lecture went very nicely, I think - 100 or so people, quite a lively discussion.  This morning I saw some of the gallery's  permanent col. - a Wright of Derby,[unclear]Pasmore[/unclear], [unclear]turcat[/unclear] tapestry, Turner, .  It is a nice group of high standard.  Some pictures are on loan there from Angus Wilson and somebody with a name like [unclear]'Odo[/unclear] Cross' = they are parted from their pictures because they are in Jamaica, at present, so I fear Wilson will not be able to come to your show, probably.
         I have no real idea of what Southampton is like because I arrived at night, spent the day in the art gallery and left at 12:30.  There is a vague sense of primly cleared bomb sites, new building of a suburban modernistic character, a king-size civic centre of the 30s, and at night, sirens and hooters.  Oh, and at least 5 cinemas.

      27 February 1953 Dearest Sylvia
      At last I have a chance to write to you - sitting in the train at South-
      ampton on my way back to town. I hope that your journey back to Pett
      on Wednesday was comfortable and, above all, that Tiny and Clifford made
      you feel welcome when you arrived. They are such an unstable pair -
      really wierd in some ways - but they do have you very much in their
      eccentric wilful manner. I certainly hope that they not upsetting
      at the moment. I am afraid several things have happened at once -
      your exhibition getting close, your exhaustion after painting so much,
      the Woods' woods, mine, the feeling you should leave Pett, seeing
      your family again, M suggesting a house at Cambridge - it is really
      a formidable collection of distrubing problems.

      I told Palmer, curator of Southampton, about your exhibition and
      he said - 'do send me a card'. He has the Gerther still-life from the Oil
      Salon there 'on spec.' at the moment - you remember it, huge, a little
      soggy. My lecture went very nicely, I think: 100 or so people,
      quite a lively discussion. This morning I saw some of the gallerys
      permanent col. - a Wright of Derby, Pasmore, Lurscat Tapestry, Tur-
      nor, &c. It is a nice group of high standard. Some pictures are on
      loan there from Angus Wilson and somebody with a name like 'Odo
      Cross: they are parted from their pictures because they are in Jamaca,
      at present, so I fear Wilson will not be able to come to your show,
      probably.

      I have no real idea of what Southampton is like for I arrived at
      night, spent the morning in the art gallery, and left at 12:30. There
      is a vogue sence of primly cleared bomb sites, new building of a
      suburban modernistic character, a King-size Civic Centre of the 30's
      and, at night, sirens and hooters. Oh and at least 5 cinemas.
