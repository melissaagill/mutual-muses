      Blackheath                      9-11-50
      Dearest Sylvia
      I am looking forward to meeting you again.  I hope you will let me know by first post Friday what is happening - whether I am to meet you on Saturday, or on Sunday & at what time.
      I am rather tired today after two lectures yesterday and so I have just [unclear]vored[/unclear] starting work on [unclear]saurat & [/unclear][unclear]Hauviean[/unclear] set:  I have afew notes further about both of them to make.  On the other hand I have an exhausting  manic compulsion to clear the flat so I am sitting among order & harmony.
      Have I not answered your questions?  Forgive me. Yes : [unclear]g'name[/unclear] I written to the Television people, and No: to have I done any work on (18th [unclear]vanities[/unclear])
      What pleasing news that [unclear]melvambre & the Nambins[/unclear] is completed.  Do bring it when you come.  Oh, & to answer a question you asked so long while ago: yes; please do bring the next volume of Proust (after Swan's Way).
      My father bought xmas cards (25) from a man at his office who makes them.  Then he & mother did not like them and I have them now.  So that aspect of x'mas shopping is solved, with the postcards we already have.  Melty is working up long lists already of people to send cards to.  [unclear]Marwullen[/unclear] too; he's going to send his now & so get lets of presents by the 25th.

      Blackheath      7  XII 50
      Dearest Sylvia, I am looking forward to meeting you again. I hope you will let me know by first post Friday what is happening, whether I am to meat you on Saturday or on Sunday & at what time.
      I am rather tired today after two lectures yesterday and so I have postponed starting work on Seurat & Roussean yet. I have  a few notes [unclear]furtle[/unclear] about both of them to make. On the other hand I have an exhausting manic computer;lsion to clean the flat so I am sitting among aides & harmony.
      Have I not answered your questions? Forgive me. Yes to have I written to the Television people, and NO to [unclear]bore[/unclear] I done any work (18th painters.
      What pleasing news that [unclear]Melpanene[/unclear] & the Jamins is completed. Do bring it with you when you come. Oh, & to answer a question you asked a long while ago, yes, please do bring the next volume of Proust (after swan's way)
      My father bought Xmas cards (25) from a man at his office who makes them. Then he & mother did not like them and I have them now. So that aspect of Xmas shopping is solved, with the postcards we already have. Hetty is making up long lists already of people to send cards to. [unclear]Yarallan[/unclear] too, he's going to send his now & so  get lots of presents on the 25th.
