      Dearest Sylvia

      Here are 2 poems for my love.  I send you the first [unclear]MSS[/unclear]
      as I have not time to copy them out.  I discovered yester-
      day that on Friday it is Toulouse Lautrec I have to talk
      about: I thought he was a week later so I have been
      preparing [unclear]Slivant de l'ausseau[/unclear] by mistake.  Therefore I
      am now on my way to the V & A & I imagine I shall
      have to go there Thursday as well because I am
      entirely unfamiliar with T-L., Alas!

      I am enchanted to hear that you are at work on The
      Poet in the Garden and 2 illustrations of poems : this
      inspires me to write more verse for you and I expect
      that I shall steal a few moment in the V & A to
      do so.  I have, of course, mentioned your original
      text in Painting Our of Doors in those instances
      where you disagreed with my suggestions.

      Sorry this letter is so hurried and poorly written -
      but we are nearing London Bridge where I must
      change.

      I love you, I adore you
      Lawrence

    annotation_text: '[28-11-50]  Dearest Sylvia  Here are 2 poems for my love.  I
      send you the first MSS as I have not time to copy them out.  I discovered yesterday
      that on Friday it is Toulouse Lautrec I have to talk about:  I thought he was
      a week later so I have been preparing Seurat & Rousseau by mistake.  Therefore
      I am now on my way to the V&A & I imagine I shall have to go there Thursday
      as well because I am entirely unfamiliar with T-L. Alas!  I am enchanted to
      hear that you are at work on The Poet in the Garden & 2 illustrations of poems:  this
      inspires me to write more verse for you & I expect that I shall steal a few
      moments in the V&A to do so.  I have, of course, retained your original text
      in Painting Out of Doors in those instances where you disagreed with my suggestions.  Sorry
      this letter is so hurried & poorly written - but we are nearing London Bridge
      where I must change.  I love you, I adore you Lawrence'
