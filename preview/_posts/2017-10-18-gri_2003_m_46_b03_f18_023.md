      Thank you so much for your letters, and above all for the poems - which please me so much aesthetically and as a lover - my darling I love you so - my delicate poet, of robust metaphors, your verse is delicate and strong, sharp and supple as a rapier.

      Thank you so much also for typing and liking my article - yes please do send it to Gainsborough as you suggest. Can you not think of any nice Dutch landscapes to illustrate it? With an artist sketching? Still the Cezanne will do - no doubt. On the whole I agree with your changes - except
      the following:- On page 1, paragraph 2, line 2. The subjunctive "be" is surely perfectly correct after "if". I prefer it even if it be old fashioned
