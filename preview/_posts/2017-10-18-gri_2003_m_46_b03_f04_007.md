      Blackheath
      Wednesday

      Dearest Sylvia,

         I break off from typing The Election chapter to send you a little news of your lion. First you may like to know I have finished the Industry and Idleness chapter and shall finish the one on which I am now engaged in an hour or so.

         All this typing has taught me one thing: namely, the difference in spelling between similar and familiar which I can now write without confusion.

         I see from an old newspaper that one teatime, in Devon, an owl flew out of a chimney, bit a lady on the chin, and, then, made good its escape. I am sure you have a story for me: what was behind his action? Which owl was it? Sounds like a new one. Tell me do.

         I saw Murillo's Pool Of Bethesda at the N.G. yesterday. It is a brand new acquisition and not yet on view to the public. It has been cleaned and though not as good as the Barber Institute one is first rate and has life-size figures.

         Fragonard's Fete, in the Gulbenkian collection, has been cleaned and is now delicious and strangely evocative.

         Talking of pictures, Mayman's Lions Leap Frogging was sold for 28. It is not as good as either the V & A examples but it is attractive, important, nonetheless. Only 28...

         And still talking of pictures I am glad you made the decision to submit some pictures to these various shows. Let me know about the Kensington Gallery: I will take you things if necessary with pleasure. Soon, my cat, you will be making your reputation. I shall tell the hundreds of lions and I think they will buy one for the Art Gallery in their town. You have not told me about one but I'm sure they have a very good one.

         The trees are much more out here now, including the line of trees across the road, cutting off the factories. The beach tree is rather advanced also.

         I am going to work every minute of Friday so do, my darling, my rose, write me a nice encouraging letter to come that morning. I shall work so much more happily and have, perhaps, everything done when we next meet.

         I think of you every moment. You are so beautiful, I love you.

      I love you,

      a lady on the chin, and, then, made good its escape.  I am sure you have a story
      for me; what was behind his action? Which owl was it? Sounds like a new one.
      Tell me do.\nI saw Murillo's Pool of Bethesda at the N.G. yesterday. It is a
      brand new acquisition and not yet on view to the public. It has been cleaned
      and though not as good as the Barber Institute one is first rate and has life-size
      figures.\nFragnonard's Fete, in the Gulbenkian collection, has been cleaned
      and is now delicious and strangely evocative. \nTalking of pictures , Hayman's
      Lions leap Frogging was sold for £28. It is not as good as wither the V & A

      \nAnd still talking about pictures I am glad you made the decision \nto submit
      some pictures to these various shows. Let me know about the Kensington gallery;
      I will take your things if necessary\nwith pleasure. I shall tell the hundreds
      of lions and I think they will buy one for the Art Gallery in their town. You
      have not told me about one but I'm sure they have a very good one.\nThe trees
      are much more out here now, including the line of \ntrees across the road, cutting
      off the factories. The beech tree is rather advanced also.\nI am going to work
      every minute of Friday so do, my darling,\nmy rose, write me a nice encouraging
      letter to come that morning . I shall work so much more happily, and have perhaps
      , everything done when we next meet.\nI think of you every moment. You are so

      3-5-50  Blackheath Wednesday Dearest Sylvia,

      I break off from typing the Election chapter to send you a
      little news of your lion.  First you may like to know I have
      finished the Industry and Idleness chapter and shall finish
      the one on which I am now engaged in an hour or so.

      All this typing has taught me one thing: namely, the dif-
      ference in spelling between similar and familiar which I can
      now write without confusion.

      I see from an old newspaper that one teatime, in Devon, an
      owl flew cut of a chimney, bit a lady on the chin, and, then,
      made good its excape.  I am sure you have a story for me: what
      was behind his action?  Which owl was it?  Sounds like a new
      one.  Tell me do.

      I saw Murillo's Pool Of Bethesda at the N.G. yesterday.  It
      is a brand new acquisistion and not yet on view to the public.
      It has been cleaned and htough ot as good as the Barber Ins-
      titute one is first rate and has life-size figures.

      Fragnonard's Fete, in the Gulbenkian collection, has been
      cleaned and is now delicious and strangely avocative.

      Talking of pictures, Hayman's Lions Leap Frogging was sold
      for 28.  It is not as good as either the V & A examples but it
      is attractive, importand, nonetheless.  Only 28...

      And still talking of pictures I am glad you made the decis-
      ions to submit some pictures to these various shows.  Let me know
      about the Kensington Gallery: I will take your things if neces-
      sary with pleasure.  Soon, my cat, you will be making your re-
      putation.  I shall tell the hundreds of lions and I think they
      will buy one for the Art Gallery in their town.  You have not
      told me about one but I'm sure they have a very good one.

      The trees are much more out here now, including the line of
      trees across the road, cutting off the factories.  The beech
      tree is rather advanced also.

      I am going to work every minute of Friday so do, my darling,
      my rose, I write me a nice encouraging letter to come that morn-
      ing.  I shall work so much more happily and have, perhaps, every-
      thing done when we next meet.

      I think of you every moment.  You are so beautiful, I love you,
      I love you,
      Lawrence
