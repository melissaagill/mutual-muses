      7    affinity where our work is concerned
      which seems to me so wonderful.
      I miss you most painfully tonight
      and wonder how you are--it is now
      10:30.  I hope that you are in bed
      and will sleep well.  I shall go to
      bed when I have finished this.
      At about 8:30 I went to water
      the garden, it was a lovely evening
      and the smallest chicks were out
      and I thought how they had grown
      since you last caught them, and how
      brief your visits were, yet in a way
      it seems as thought you were always
      here--and as I came back across
      the grass in the sunset I thought how
      happy I should be if I could see
      your elegant figure appear round the
      wall and walk round the drive
      in front of the house.  What a pity
      it is that purely private concerns
      excite the interest and consure of
      society, then you should be here
      now, my darling, in my arms-
      I would that you were.

      I miss you most painfully tonight and wonder how you are - it is now 10.30 I
      hope that you are in bed and will sleep well - I shall go to bed when I have
      finished this. At about 8.30 I went to water the garden, it was a lovely evening
      and the smallest chickens were out and I thought how they had grown since you
      last caught them, and how brief your visits were, yet in a way it seems as though
      you were always here - and as I came back across the grass in the sunset I thought
      how happy I should be if I could see your elegant figure appear round the wall
      and walk round the drive in front of the house. What a pity it is that purely
      private concerns excite the interest and [unclear]consise[/unclear] of society,
      then you should be here now, my darling, in my arms - I would that you were.

    annotation_text: affinity where our work is concerned which seems to me so wonderful.
      I miss you most painfully to-night and wonder how you are. it is now 10.30,
      i hope that you are in bed and will sleep well. I shall go to bed when i have
      finished this. At about 8.30 i went to water the garden, it was a lovely evening
      and the smallest chickens were out and i thought how they had grown since you
      last caught them, and how brief your visits were, yet in a way it seems as though
      you were always here - and as i came back across the grass in the sunset i thoght
      how happy i should be if i could see your elegant figure appear round the wall
      and walk round the drive infront of the house. Whar a pity it is that purely
      private concerns excite the interest and censure of society, then you should
      be here now, my darling, in my arms. I would that you were.
