      Midland Hotel - B'ham     2 ii 1950
      Dearest Sylvia
      How I wish you were here for I am going to the [unclear][/unclear]again this morning to look at the pictures and I know we would enjoy it. I shall think so tenderly of you as I see again the Murillo, the Rubens, the Gainsborough.
      I could not afford lunch on the train yesterday so I did not eat between breakfast and dinner. However, the dinner was really admirable: guinea fowl being the main course. I have just eaten a great breakfast and I shall also add lunch to the University account here before returning to London & dinner with [unclear][/unclear] [unclear][/unclear]. I have plenty to eat at home so do not worry, my love.
      My lecture began a little weakly I think but improved as it went on. Both Russell and Garlick said they had learned much from it: Lautrec really is an exciting & interesting figure. His influences include Uccello, Baldoninetti, Velasquez & Maroni, Browner, Brueglel, Bosch, Daumies, mannerist art generally, Japanese color prints, & c. Do you know his late works? They are among his most impressive productions, concentrated & monumental.
      You will be glad to hear [unclear][/unclear] Russell agrees with us (though, of course, I did not name you to him) that what modern art needs is a revival of history painting. He is at work on some mythological panels even now.
      By the way, in the draft of your article are various uncorrected spelling mistakes-all of which I set right in the MS I actually submitted. I mention that in case you re-read your version, & should feel worried.
      I enclose at last 3 more poems for you. The Paradox in the longer one is the Paradox of the Fortunate Fall, put to non X-tian purposes, of course.  I love you dearly Lawrence

      Midland Hotel - B'ham 2 X11 1950
      Dearest Sylvia
       How I wish you were here for I am going to the Barker again this morning to look at the pictures and I know we would enjoy it. I shall think so tenderly of you as I see again the Murillo, the Rubens, the Gainsborough.
       I could not afford lunch on the train yesterday so I did not eat between breakfast and dinner. however the dinner was really admirable: guinea fowl being the main course. I have just eaten a great breakfast and I shall also add lunch to the University Account here before returning to London and dinner with Ithell Colquhoun. I have plenty to eat at home so do not worry, my dove.
       My lecture began a little weakly, I think but improved as it went on. Both Russell and Garlick said they had learned much from it: Lautrec really is an exciting and interesting figure. His influences include Uccello, Baldovinetti, Velasquez and Moroni, Braumer, Brueghel, Bosch, Daumier, mannerist and generally, Japanese color prints, &c. Do you know his late works? They are among his most impressive productions, concentrated and monumental.
      You will be glad to know Russell agrees with us ( though, of course, I did not name you to him) that what modern art needs is a revival of History Painting. He is at work on some mythological panels even now.
       By the way, in the draft of your article are various uncorrected spelling mistakes - all of which I set right in the MS I actually submitted. I mention that in case you re-read your version & should feel worried.
       I enclose at last 3 more poems for you. The paradox in the larger one is the Paradox of the Fortunate Fall, put to non X-tian purposes, of course.
      I love you dearly
      Lawrence
