      Dearest Lawrence
      Thank you for the delightful extracts - they are so good, the finished poems should be excellent. Tiny has bought the book of prize poems -they are extremely dull - and technically, the ones I have scanned do not seem very inventive, and lack stimulating and inventive metaphors. Tiny says I may bring them to show you.
      I have told the Greenwoods provisionally the 14th or 15th, but I can let them know as soon as you do!
      I wish I could have come to the Banstead lecture - it sounds delightful. How was the "Lion in Love" - Did Yawolla like the pen-knife?
