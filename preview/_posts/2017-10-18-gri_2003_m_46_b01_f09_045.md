      Wimbledon
      18 x 1948
      Dearest Sylvia,

      Your letter was very precious to me and I was delighted at your appreciation of my poems which was elegant and generous.  Your poet-laureate could not fail to respond to your tribute so I have written, though rather quickly, the following sonnet.  The idea is that the rococo interest in ruins as interior decoration is a way of rejecting their psychological meaning which you mentioned to me the other day.  The poem has a cast of three:

      As far as the eye can see the world is dead,
      Except for a few lines of washing, wind-stirred,
      A cowherd wandering among the statues, (noseless victims of the barbarians).
      Great empty colonnades and flattened pyramids,
      Make us remember heavy-handed Time:
      'Ye sacred ruins, and ye tragic sights,
      Which only do the name of Rome retain [unclear]![/unclear]

      But we shall put it in a frame
      Of eighteenth century design,
      Transport the dark Campagna
      Into the boudoir's dainty compass
      Where, like a patch upon a beauty's shoulder,
      It shall be counterpoint to our delight.

    clean_transcription: '11 Mansel Road<br/>18 x 1946 Wimbledon<br/><br/>Dearest
      Sylvia,<br/><br/>Your letter was very precious to me and<br/>I was delighted
      at your appreciations of <br/>my poems which was elegant and generous. <br/>Your
      poet-laureated could not fail to re-<br/>spond to your tribute so I have written,<br/>though
      rather quickly, the following son-<br/>nst.  The idea is that the rococo inter-<br/>est
      in ruins as interior decoration is a<br/>way of rejecting their psychological
      mean-<br/>ing which you mentioned to me the other<br/>day.  The poem has a cast
      of three:<br/><br/>As far as the eye can see the world<br/>is dead,<br/>Except
      for a few lines of washing, <br/>wind-stirred,<br/>A cowherd wandering among
      the statues,<br/>(noseless victims of the barbarians).<br/>Great empty collonades
      and flattened<br/>pyramids,<br/>Make us remember heavy-handed Time:<br/>''Ye
      sacred ruins, and ye tragic sights,<br/>Which only do the name of Rome retain!<br/><br/>But
      we shall put in a frame<br/>Of eighteenth century design,<br/>Transport the
      dark Campagna<br/>Into the boudoir''s dainty compass<br/>Where, like a patch
      upon a beauty''s <br/>should, <br/>It shall be counterpoint to our de-<br/>light.  '
