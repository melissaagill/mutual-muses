      Dearest Sylvia -
      I have got Mrs. Behn's novel as I hoped so if you are interested we will read it together. I am quite tempted to start already - but I shan't. I have more than enough to read as it is. I feel at the moment
      as you do when the Horizon, Listener, New States-man, &c. pile up unread.
      Do you know yet which day you will come? I
      imagine it would best to come on Monday or
      Tuesday. We shall be late on Wednesday owing
      to Machiavelli at the Mercury and I don't want
      you to travel the same day as that.
      I hope to have our poem in a fairly good state
      when you come and then I want you to make your
      suggestions for I want the poem to represent us
      both. If it does not do that I have failed. As
      the titles of the parts show the lovers speak independ-

      Dearest Sylvia-
      I have got Mrs. Behn's novel as I hoped so if you
      are interested we will read it together. I am quite
      tempted to start already- but I shan't. I have more
      than enough to read as it is. I feel at the moment
      as you do when the Horizon, Listeners, New States-
      men, &c pile up unread.
      Do you know yet which day you will come? I
      imagine it would be best to come on Monday or
      Tuesday.  We shall be late on Wednesday owing
      to Machiavelli at the Mercury and I don't want
      you to travel the same day as that.
      I hope to have our poem in a fairly good state
      when you come and then I want you to make your
      suggestions for I want the poem to represent us
      both.  If it does not do that I have failed.  As
      the titles of the parts show the lovers speak independ-
      antly and then listen together to Love's Advice and
      Comments.  The wishes of the bridegroom must be
      answered [unclear]by[/unclear] the wishes of the bride.
