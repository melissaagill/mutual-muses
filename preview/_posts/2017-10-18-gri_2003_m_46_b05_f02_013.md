      In T6 Train  7 Feb 1952

      Dearest Sylvia
      I just had time to look in on Pane (between S [unclear]Paveran 8[/unclear]
      [unclear]uniroad SC[/unclear]. As I suspected he has not yet written to you
      but he is about to. Even so, I may be first with the news.
      He is very excited at the news of your joint exhibition but
      there are two possible obstacles. One is the money= he is not sure of raising 30, being very doubtful of his [unclear]battle[/unclear] in
      this case. The other difficulty is that he may (repeat MAY) get a
      designing job which would not leave him much time for painting
      and he has not enough good-enough words at the moment. Despite
      these promises he is very interested indeed & the job he has in
      mind will be settled, one way or the other, early next week.

      He has had a very lean time for the last month or so- [unclear]with[/unclear]
      painting [unclear]but[/unclear] designing- after being short of money. He even tho-
      ught of going back to S. Africa for a time (food & sunshine).
      He & I are going to have lunch at Wimbledon on Sunday & we shall
      talk it over in more detail. If possible he will [unclear]go[/unclear] - he wants
      to if he can. He adores the oil you gave him more & more [unclear]he has[/unclear]
      drawn a frame for Kissing on the wall around your watercolor.

      I only saw Pane for a few minutes so we could not talk
      matters over property. More [unclear]of[/unclear] the quality of work are the
      worries. He was doubtful about putting automatic works in

      I just had time to look in on Paul (between S Pancras & Liverpool St.).  As I suspected he has not yet written to you but he is about to.  Even so, I may be first with the news.  He is very excited at the news of your joint exhibition but there are two possible obstacles.  One is the money += he is not sure of raising Â£30, being very doubtful of his father in this case.  The other difficulty is that he may (repeat may) get a designing job which would not leave him much time for painting and he has not enough good -enough work at the moment.  [unclear][/unclear] these promises he is very interested indeed & the job he has in mind will be settled, one way or the other, early next wee.

      He has a very lean time for the last months or so - not painting but designing - often being short of money.  He even thought of going back to S. Africa for a time (food & sunshine).  He is I one going to have lunch at Wimbledon on Sunday & we shall talk it over in more detail.  If possible he will show - he wants to if he can.  He adores the oil you gave him more so [unclear][/unclear] [unclear][/unclear] kissing on the wall around your watercolour.

      In the Train                     7 Feb. 1952
      Dearest Sylvia
      I just had time to look in on Paul (between S Pancras & Vineyard St.). As I suspected he has not yet written to you but he is about to. Even so, I may be first with the news. He is very excited at the news of your joint exhibition but there are two possible obstacles. One is the money-he is not sure of raising 30, being very doubtful of his father in this case. The other difficulty is that he may (repeat MAY) get a designing job which would not leave him much time for painting and he has not enough good-enough work at the moment. Despite these provisions he is very interested indeed & the job he has in mind will be settled, one way or the other, early next week.
      He has had a very lean time for the last month or so-not painting but designing-after being short of money. He even thought of going back to S. Africa for a time (food & sunshine). He & I are going to have lunch at Wimbledon on Sunday & we shall talk it over in more detail. If possible he will [unclear][/unclear]-he wants to if he can. He adores the oil you gave him more & more & has drawn a frame for Kissing on the walls around your watercolor. I only saw Paul for a few minutes so we could not talk matters over properly. Money & the quantity of work are the worries. He was doubtful about putting automatic works in
