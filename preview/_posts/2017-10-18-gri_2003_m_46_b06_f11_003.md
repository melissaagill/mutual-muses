      2 XI
      Dearest Sylvia
      I don't know yet the results of the survey but we will
      hear very soon. I sent [unclear]Dannatt[/unclear] your queries. As you
      know - it was this morning. I can't wait to hear.

      I have done one of my 2 Magritte articles and am at
      work on the other. I have collected today the final
      photographs for the non-figurative articles - So I can
      send that off tomorrow. You remember that nice
      American magazine Arts & Architecture? I may be
      writing an article for it in the near future. I will
      tell you more when I see you.

      I am on my way home. With this chill on my stomach
      I simply could not go to the [unclear]Harpenden[/unclear] tonight and
      I am tired.

      I am longing to see you. You do understand
      about my Art News article: I must not be
      late with that. At all costs it must be
      first rate and on time - the job being worth
      so much as a regular commission. It will help
      us at 46. Unless I hear to the contrary I ex-
      pect to see you Wednesday afternoon at
      Sutton, whenever you say. I love you

      2 Magritte articles and am at work on the other. I have collected today the
      final photographs for the non-figurative article - so I can send that off tomorrow.
      You remember that nice American magazine Arts & Architecture? I may be writing
      an article for it in the near future. I will tell you more when I see you. <br/>I
      am on my way home. With this chill on my stomach I simply could not go to the
      Harpenden tonight and I am tired.<br/>I am longing to see you. You do understand
      about my Art News article: I must not be late with that. At all costs it must
      be first rate and on time - the job being worth so much as a regular commission.
      It will help us at 46. Unless I hear to the contrary I expect to see you Wednesday
      afternoon at Sutton, whenever you say. I love you Lawrence'

      Dearest Sylvia
      I don't know yet the results of the survey but we will
      hear very soon.  I sent Dannatt your queries.  As you
      know--it was this morning.  I can't wait to hear.
      I have done one of my 2 Magritte articles and am at
      work on the other.  I have collected today the final

      I am on my way home.  With this chill on my stomach
      I simply could not go to Harpenden tonight and
      I am tired.
