      26 November 1952 Dearest Sylvia
      The weather is more fine today and as usual
      each change in the weather is translated into
      terms of Pett by me. Soon - once your exhibit-
      ion in the studio is near - you will perhaps be
      able to complete your water color of the shore.
      That is one of your finest drawings I think. I
      am glad - turning my attention indoors - that
      Renaldo Armide is more or less complete & I look
      forward to seeing it in January.

      Today I am having tea with VP, K Martin, & Robert
      Adams to discuss the manifesto. Before that, how-
      ever, I am going to do some of the Bond St. Galleries:
      [unclear][/unclear] rather tea pleasure - as you well know. A
      S. America artist named Guariana (you know - he
      did the Edith portrait in the TS) has a memorial
      show at the Mayor Gal. Osbert was an admirer
      of his in the 20's. So I may enjoy that. I think
      I shall include him in tomorrow's lecture on
      Modern British Art.

      The film I mentioned to you (at Golders' Green)
      Talk About A Stranger was very good. It was
      plychological in a detached but lyrical manner

      26 November 1952
      Dearest Sylvia
      The weather is more fine today and as usual each change in the weather is translated into terms of Pett by me. Soon - once your exhibition in the studio is over - you will perhaps be able to complete your water color of the shore.
      That is one of your finest drawings I think. I am glad - turning my attention indoors - that Rinaldo & Armide is more or less complete as I look forward to seeing it in January.
      Today I am having tea with VP, K Martin, & Robert Adams to discuss the manifesto. Before that, however I am going to 'do' some of the Bond St. galleries: duty rather than pleasure - as you well know. A S. America artist named [unclear]Juarava[/unclear] (you know he did the Edith portrait in UTS) has a memorial shoe at the Moyes Gal. Osbert was an admirer of his in the 20s. So I may enjoy that. I think I shall include him in Tomorrow's lecture on Modern British Art.
