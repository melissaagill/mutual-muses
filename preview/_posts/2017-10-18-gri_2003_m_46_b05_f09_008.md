      The fence in the garden is being repaired. That means that a
      gap in the fence opposite the kitchen door will be filled in. Now it is
      Pahlo's custom to run out of the door as soon as it is opened & thus
      appear  through this gap. We are concerned in this matter for Pahlo is
      short-sighted. We fear one day soon he will rush out (in the usual
      way), not realise the change, and be stunned or, at least, bend his
      whiskers. What can you recommend?
      Before returning home this evening Mother and Father are taking
      me to Wimbledon Theatre to see Kiss Me Kate, the Cole Porter musical.
      I am looking forward to this for, in addition to the activities men-
      tioned above I am working out the categories of musical films.
      Provisionally I distinguish a scale with the PEDESTRIAN (you see
      the point?) Musical at one end and the BALLETIC at the other.
      (Singin' In The Rain I see as a 20c masque, a fairly rare form.)
      The Pedestrian musical is one where all the dancing & singing is ration-
      alised in night clubs or theatre percormances: the balletic is the type
      in which the dancing & singing grow out of a real environment, like
      On TC Town and Belle of NY. Kiss me Kate deals with a company
      backstage who are going to put on a musical revision of The Shrew: you
      see how the music & dancing are rationalised right away, as well as
      combined with a rayeur in-the-know appeal.
      About the earliest short story writers I have thought is Hoffman
      as his pieces are a bit primitive he must be near the start. Have you
      thought of anybody else, besides Poe & Hawthorne?
      Your lion is recovering - His neck is going down and his cold
      is not bad at all by now. Mother is feeding me nicely, so I shall
      become a fat lion. I slept well last night: and you?
