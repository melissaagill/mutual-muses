      28th December 1948

      Dearest Sylvia,

      I thought at first they were black-
      berry leaves and then, for some reason,
      managed to persuade myself they were
      rose-leaves. You can imagine why -
      I am sure.

      Yes, do bring your navy blue with
      the taffeta. Dandylion adores that
      dress as you know. I have no idea
      what we shall have to do - except that
      I have to speak at an opening ceremony.
      I suppose a dinner or two is possible.
      I am sure your grey coat is enough -
      it is charming. Certainly no evening dress

      For Christmas I had a kind of Gal-
      lery book about the Louvre Embarkation
      to Cythera and this morning I intend
      to spend two modest book tokens.

      By the way - a word of explanation.
      I went to Zwemmer to get the Giorgione
      Adoration book but it seemed expensive
      for very little. I was undecided when
      the tawny owl tugged me to where the
      white one was struggling to get down
      a large book. It was the Leadership
