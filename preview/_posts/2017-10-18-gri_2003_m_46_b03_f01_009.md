      LATER

      I have been in town some little time now- it is afternoon, almost tea-time. I have been again to Barbizon School; today I am a patient, conscientious lion, not, as so often at galleries, an hedonist. Needless to say I thought of our visit strongly and though today it was calm, nobody attacked me, I regretted passionately you were not with me.

      I hope that you are able to buy the cups today - we do need them. To answer several points in your letter; of course I will try for your button - be sure to send me ex-act size, substance, &c. I have not bought but will buy the sugar.

      My wisdom tooth is not comfortable and, at present, I very much doubt the wisdom of having them at my advanced age.

      I had lunch with Charles and we are going to dine at [unclear]Variant Mance[/unclear] next Tuesday, after a Courtauld lecture on Watteau's Lyttere. In an hour I am going to Carsons - so I shall be smart for meeting Paul who has a new pair of suede boots (Jackie took him shopping) and i ex-pect he will have some news about the review. I will certainly let you know what has happened.

      I adore you
      Lawrence

      LATER
      I have been in town some little time now - it is afternoon, almost tea-time. I have been again to Burlington House and made some notes on the Barbizon school; today I am a patient, conscientious lion, not, as so often at galleries, an hedonist. Needless to say I thought of our visit strongly and though today it was calm, nobody attacked me, I regretted passionately you were not with me.
      I hope that you are able to buy the cups today - we do need them. To answer several points in your letter: of course I will try for your button - be sure to send me ex-act size, substance, &c. I have not bought but will buy the sugar.
      My wisdom tooth is not comfortable and, at present, I very much doubt the wisdom of having them at my advanced age
      I had lunch with Charles and we are going to dine at Vincent House next Tuesday, after a [unclear]courtaned[/unclear] lecture on Watteau's Cythere. In an hour I am going to Carsons - so I shall be smart for meeting Paul who has a new pair of suede boots (Jackie took him shopping) and I ex-pect he will have some news about the revue. I will certainly let you know what has happened.
                    I adore you
                               Lawrence
