      N.G 11.1.54
      Dearest Sylvia - my love,
      It was so good to hear your sweet voice on the telephone and marvellous to hear that you are easier in your state of mind - now that we have got 36. There will be some problems - but nothing serious compared to what you have been through my poor darling. Speaking for myself I could not be more pleased and happy that our future hom is, at last, secured. We shall have a wonderful life there together. I am happy about it - full of confidence as I hope and believe you must be, too. [greate about the price.]
      I have told Monica nothing doing. [unclear]Molly and the Cardells[/unclear] - the people I have told - are very pleased indeed and send their love.
      I cannot come on Thursday but I could on Friday. Unless I hear to the contrary I shall come Tuesday (let me know if Friday is better). I will tell you the time in my next letter.
      Sorry to have been so poor a correspondent but I have been unbelievably busy. Next week I can relax a little. today I must go to Wolverhampton and tomorrow lecture on [unclear]Yugoslav [/unclear]frescoes at 1.00 and [unclear]to Barnten[/unclear] on Modern ARt at 4.00. (The Architectural Review piece - 600 words - about Pasmore is fixed for March - definitely.)
      I love you and long to see you next week.
      Love you
      Lawrence

      N.G. 11.1 54
      Dearest Sylvia - my love,

      It was so good to hear your sweet voice on the telephone and marvellous to hear that you are easier in your state of mind - now that we have got 36. There will be some problems - but nothing serious  compared to what you have been through my poor darling. Speaking for myself I could not be more pleased & happy that our future home is, at last, secured - we shall have a wonderful life there together. I am happy about it - full of confidence as I hope and believe you must be, too. [great about the price.]

      I have told Monica nothing doing. Molly and the Cardells - the people I have told - are very pleased indeed and send their love.
      I cannot come on Thursday but I  could on Friday. Unless I hear to the contrary I shall come Tuesday (let me know if Friday is better). I will tell you the time in my next letter.

      Sorry to have been so poor a corespondent but I have been unbelievably busy. Next week I can relax a little. To-day I must go to Wolverhampton & tomorrow lecture on Jugoslav frescoes at 1.00 & to Banstead on Modern art at 4.00. (The Architectural Review piece - 600 words - about Pasmore is fixed for March - definitely.)
      I love you & long to see you next week love you
      Lawrence
