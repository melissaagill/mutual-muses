      I'm rather tired anyway so I shaln't go. I shall have a rest in the rose-garden with the Listener and P.L.MA. It seems rather an economics number I'm afraid. Then I must try to finish the "G.A" as Mme [unclear]Bangae[/unclear] is coming to see it tomorrow. There is a rehearsal of the [unclear] music[/unclear] for the sete and Mrs Bangae is going to sing. I'm to help with the mime. Ruth and I are going (appropriately enough) to be the sea! We have to undulate a piece of cloth I understand; Ruth has passed her exams as a probationer nurser for the L.C.C. She was 4th from the bottom and there were 300 who passed and 100 who failed! What could the 100 have been like?!! Anyway she is very happy and relieved.

      3    I'm rather tired anyway so I shaln't
      go.  I shall have a rest in the

      "GA" as Mrs. Baugar is coming
      to see it tomorrow.  There is a
      rehearsal of the Mimse for the Fete

      I'm to help with the mime, Ruth
      and I are going (appropriately enough)
      to be the sea!  We have to un-

      100 who fainted!  What could the 100
      have been like?!!  Anyway she is
      very happy and relieve.
      I'm so glad you have met Pas-
