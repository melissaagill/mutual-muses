      4   of distance from his materials'.  Te novelist 'can count on
      major advantages unavailable to the story writer:  the accumu-
      lated, unpredictable effects of prolonged characterization, the
      independent momentum of a plot that becomes something more than a
      mere frame for manipulation.'  In the mechanistic story, and in
      the portanteau film as we shall see, there is no creative dis-
      tance and plot is rarely more than la mere frame for manipulation'.
      The story and the authors are naively intertwined in a art-as-
      the-mirror-of-life equation.

      Episodic films may be divided into three categories.
      Weekend at the Waldorf, Holiday Camp, Bank Holiday, Domenico
      d'Augusto, and others suggest a vertical structure:  the stories
      are the consequence of urban overcrowding or of saturnalaian par-
      ticipation in a festival.  A kind of simultaneity is conveyed--
      of stories unfolding concurrently in time--that is to say vertically.
      A horizontal form is to be seen in La Ronde, Dead of Night,
      Paisa, La citta se defende, and others.  One main point of view
      governs from these films, beyond that of a common site or occas-
      ion (the vertical form).  Attitudes to desire, fate, war emerge
      so that the episodes contribute to ap oint of view which they con-
      cretise or illustrate.
