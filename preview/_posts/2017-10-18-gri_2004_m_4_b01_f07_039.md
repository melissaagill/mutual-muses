      4 v 1950

      Dearest Sylvia,

      Thank you for your letter. I am glad to hear the carrier will unpack your pictures but I do not share your dis-may about the price he is charging. Is that really expensive. I should not have thought so. Still, I suppose you know.

      I had to ring up Vallance last night to make an arrangement about Saturday and he asked me, again, because several people had asked him, if I would be able to bring any of Miss Sleigh's work. I was able to re-assure him. I am meeting John McHale this evening after the A.I.A. meeting and he is going to let me have some pictures then. Paul Southey and Eric are going to let me have some. So, altogether, I should be able to muster a pleasant group of about 16 paintings, maybe more.

      Charles is having two days in bed. He has some sordid symptoms which I shall spare you which he described at lunch on Tuesday. He said he was going to the Doctor. Clare has all the lectures though.

      and he is going to let me have some pictures then. Paul Southey and Eric are
      going to let me have some. So, altogether, I should be able to muster a pleasant
      group of about 16 paintings, maybe more. Charles is having two days in bed.
      He has some sordid symptoms which I shall spare you which he described at lunch
      on Tuesday. He said he was going to the Doctor. Clare has all the lectures though.

      Dearest Sylvia,

      Thank you for your letter.  I am glad
      to hear the carrier will unpack your
      pictures but I do not share your dis-
      may about the price he is charging.
      Is that really expensive.  I should
      not have thought so.  Still, I suppose
      you know.

      I had to ring up Vallance last night
      to make an arrangement about Saturday
      and he asked me, again, because several
      people had asked him, I he would be
      able to bring any of Miss Sleigh's
      work.  I was able to reassure him.
      I am meeting John McHale this evening
      after the A.I.A. meeting and he is going
      to let me have some pictures then.
      Pual Southey and Eric are going to
      let me have some.  So, altogether, I
      should be able to muster a pleasent
      group of about 16 paintings, maybe more.

      Charles is having two days in bed.  He
      has some sordid symptoms which I shall
      spare you which he described at lunch on
      Tuesday.  He said he was going to the
      Doctor.  Clare has all the lectures though.
