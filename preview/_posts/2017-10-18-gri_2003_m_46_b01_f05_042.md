      worry as I feel you might do. I have had a slight operation from which I am now entirely recovered. And what was it for? Alas, this is rather sordid, but for varicose veins, which had developed in me so early as the result of my two-year illness of eight years ago. I have scars and knee and groin but am otherwise in normal health.  Darling, you must forgive me for not telling you but I should have been so unhappy if I knew you were worrying needlessly. Things are difficult for you anyway, the burden of letters and housework and Michael's melancholy, so I could not bear to add to this.  So it was, after very long consideration, I decided on this course.
      This weather is a great nuisance to me as I hoped to arrive with, at least, some pink about me, but it seems this is to be frustrated. Perhaps you are luckier with the sun at Pett. I see that Hastings the other had over 12 hours of sunshine.

      Pelt.  I see that  the other day had one day with 12 hours of sunshine.
