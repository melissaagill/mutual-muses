      I have just been writing out notes for Seurat and so I am still surrounded by books and notes. I decided to type this letter rather than inflict my pencil written letters on you again: the trouble is my pen is almost run out, can manage addresses and the like, but stops dead at anything like a page.

      I collected your pictures yesterday. The Smiths did not mention that they had been to the exhibition though they always look out of the door hopefully - behind me.

      Did you know, I have just this moment read it, that little boys threw stones at Seurat when he was making some his 70 preparatory sketches for La Grande Jatte? Incidentally I know the Claude you mean but not how to get a photograph of it for your article.

    annotation_text: "Blackhearth     5 xii 50\n\nDearest Sylvia,\nI have just been
      writing out notes for Seurat and so I am still surrounded by books and notes.
      I decided to type this letter rather than inflict my pencil written letters
      on you again: the trouble is my pen is almost run out, can manage addresses
      and the like, but stops dead at anything like a page. \n\nI collected your pictures
      yesterday. The Smiths did not mention that they had been to the exhibition though
      they always look out of the door hopefully – behind me. \n\nDid you know, I
      have just this moment read it, that little boys threw stones at Seurat when
      he was making some of his 70 preparatory sketches for La Grande Jatte? Incidentally
      I now the Claude you mean but not how to get a photograph of it for your article.
      \n\nI had a very jolly time at B’ham, including midday drinks on Saturday with
      Bodkin’s other assistant Peter Kelly (at his club so I could not pay, quite
      apart from the fact that I could not pay…). Garlick is lecturing, later in the
      series, about the Royal Academy in the latter 19th century. I have looked up
      some slides for him, even locating one called James II hearing the news of the
      landing of the Prince of Orange… \n\nThe skating pond, as I realise the mirror
      is in my little window-ledge garden, is very appropriate today. The sun was
      out a little while ago and made the landscape very pretty but now there is only
      the white reflection of snow on the ceiling. I need not tell you Yawolla is
      delighted. He has threatened to snowball Dandy on his way to post this.\n\nI
      love you\n\nLawrence\n"
