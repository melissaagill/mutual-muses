      Blackheath 6th March

      Dearest Sylvia
      My letter this morning was rather intense and in this one I want to tell you again of my love, of my great love for you, my nurse, my pointes - my beauty.  Today is warm and as I walked along Blackheath Park my mind and heart were full of you.  I hope you will be loving and not distract when you come.  Do not worry about my letter: yours aroused the insecurity I too can feel - as well as you -  but be assured my only love of love - I live only for you - my rose.

      Today I worked on Hogarth again (it is only 6000 words now) and now I am shopping in the village.  When I go home I shall have a dust because you are coming and Dandy does not want to receive you inappropriately.

      Charles Johnson is in bed with 'flu and so I am having to take the afternoon lecture on Wednesday, at 3 o'clock. I shall end it at 4 o'clock sharp and come straight to Tewisham where I am fairly sure I will get before you.  If you should arrive first it will be only by a moment or so - so do WAIT, if I am not there, first, first, as I expect to be, I shall wait there where the bus stopped last time.  I hope that is clear.  Dandy, Hetty, & Lionel all put their heads together to get it straight - Dandy says - don't be cross with him - he loves you:  (He is looking sideways in his portrait to see if you are kind to him.)

      I Love you Lawrence
