      3    tomorrow I hope to do the
      rest of the background and the
      pineapple which I hope Clifford
      will bring from Brighton.  If he
      does not bring it I shall do the
      Beueditive bottle and the decanter
      and the back of the table top!  So you
      see I am quite well on with
      it.  I have got down the frame
      and washed it--it needs a little
      touching up--but is in a good
      state on the whole.  I shall
      prepare it over the weekend so
      that there is no last minute
      rush (I hope)
      Today I have made my second
      batch of marmalade.  I have
      to cover it then I think I
      shall go to bed as I feel very
      tired.
      The dinner party with the Shewells
      went off very well--they are awfully
      pleasant but very dull.  We listened
      to Winnie's speech at nine.
      Clifford said to me afterwards how right you
      were to describe him as a "Ham
      actor".  Mrs. Shewell declared
      with real feeling that no one

      3 to-morrow I hope to do the
      rest of the back-ground and the
      pine-apple which I hope Clifford
      will bring from [unclear]Brighton[/unclear];. If he
      does not bring it I shall do the
      [unclear]Bevedefuin[/unclear] bottle and the decanter
      and the back of the tabletop! So you
      see I am quite well on with
      it. I have got down the frame
      and [unclear]washed[/unclear] it – it needs a little
      touching up – but is in a good
      state on the whole. I shall
      prepare it over the week-end so
      that there is no last minute
      rush! (I hope)
      To-day I have made my second
      batch of marmalade – I have
      to cover it then I think I
      shall go to bed as I feel very
      tired.
      The dinner party with the [unclear]Shewells[/unclear]
      went off very well – they are awfully
      pleasant but very dull. We listened
      to Winnie's speech at nine –
      Clifford said to me afterwards how right you
      were to describe him as a "Ham
      actor" – Mrs [unclear]Shewell[/unclear] declared
