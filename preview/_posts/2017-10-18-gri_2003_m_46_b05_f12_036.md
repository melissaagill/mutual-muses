      Well my darling I must get on with my
      work. After I have completed the Tudor notes,
      I must make a start on Wilson. Then I am
      going to do my Christmas cards.

      (I am afraid I hardly ever remember to
      make my 'fs' the way you like them. Now &
      again I remember - and, I am trying.)

      I adore you I adore you
      I love you
      Lawrence

      Dandy with his 2 new books in bed.
      He has attempted a [unclear][/unclear] effect
      (coutre jour) but he is less skilled
      in such matters then you are.
      Love L

      PS I enclose your cheque. A new one made out
      to F.L. Alloway is [unclear][/unclear] the best thing, please.
