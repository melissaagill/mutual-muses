      4    and very readable--though as I
      said a bit novelettist here and
      there and I do object to his
      characterization of feminine
      characteristics and Ruskin.  I have
      only just realized (as wilder was
      in his "road gangt") that R.
      probably had as much influence
      as Pater in the jewelled style or
      the '90's.  I felt so tired after
      a bad night and some work
      in the garden this morning that
      I went and lay in the garden
      where I write this.  I hope
      to paint Clifford after tea.  It
      is more than warm enough.
      I am quite naked except for
      m hat and a skirt draped
      up under my bottom--in case!
      I shall go to the post with
      this now and hope to paint
      a lot of Clifford after tea.
      I adore you, dearest Dandy,
      and long for your return as do
      C. and T.  dear love, sweet muse, I love you.
      Sylvia

      and very readable, though as I said a bit novelettist here and there and I do object to his characterization of feministic characteristics a Ruskin. I have only just realised (as Wilde was in his "road gang") that R. probably had as much influence as Pater in the jewelled style of the 90's. I felt so tired after a bad night and some work in the garden this morning that I went and lay in the garden where I write this. I hope to paint Clifford after tea. It is more tthan warm enough. I am quite naked except for my hat and a skirt draped up under my bottom, in case! I shall go to the post with this now and hope to paint a ... of Clifford after tea. I adore you, dearest Dandy, and long for your retur as do

      C. and I. dear love, sweet muse, I love you
