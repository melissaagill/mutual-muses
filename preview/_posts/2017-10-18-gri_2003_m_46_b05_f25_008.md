      POET IN TWO LIGHTS

      There were the objects, there was the poet.
      They floated in the avalanche of light,
      Sleepy from the excesses, raving
      In the flux no orator could pattern.

      Time riddles the poet by the sphinx
      Squatting on the mantelpiece like a clock,
      The numerals sadistic as a flint,
      A salad of shark's teeth and spiky numbers.

      Erudite chairs posing their geometry
      On the enigmatic square of carpet:
      There was the problem, there was the poet
      Helpless as a vase filled with water.

      Poltergeists are talented exponents
      Of the pathetic fallacy, he reasoned:
      But the flying furniture did not abate,
      Accepting no eremitical ideal of repose.

      The green arm chairs tremble like cascades,
      The electric fire prances like a horse,
      The table regresses to before the axe,
      The mobile is planets dripping fire.

      Bars of the wind, oh the streets escape
      From the table chained to my tongue.
      The photographs of the glass aqueduct
      Is complex as a prism of two rooms.

      Suppose a dream made a riot active
      And the wardrobe opened to a desert,
      Curtains were the color of a fallen neon sign,
      Carnations broaches at the throat of death.

      Suppose a dream raised the room
      A hundred feet, the garden as a ceiling
      A hundred feet below and the flowers
      Dropped out of the earth and fell like meteors.

      New as a haircut with distant conotations
      Of the sphinx, the princess, and the prism
      The chair eclipses the window and I lie
      Breathless on the lunar moss and wait.

      Cups are craters gouged by early comets,
      Forks symbolize Poseidon's enmity,
      I lie in the rectangle emitted by the sun
      Beyond the reach of kettle, clock, or hinge.

      POET IN TWO LIGHTS

      There were the objects, there was the poet.
      They floated in the avalanche of light,
      Sleepy from the excesses, raving
      In the flux no orator could pattern.

      Time riddles the poet by the sphinx
      Squatting on the mantlepiece like a clock,
      The numerals sadistic as a flint,
      A salad of shark's teeth and spiky numbers.

      Erudite chairs posing their geometry
      On the enigmatic square of carpet:
      There was the problem, there was the poet
      Helpless as a vase filled with water.

      Poltergeists are talented exponents
      Of the pathetic fallacy, he reasoned:
      But the flying furniture did not abate,
      Accepting no eremitical ideal of repose.

      The green arm chairs tremble like cascades,
      The electric fire prances like a horse,
      The table regresses to before the axe,
      The mobile is planets dripping fire.

      Bars of the wind, oh the streets escape
      From the table chained to my tongue.
      The photographs of the glass aquaduct
      Is complex as a prism of two rooms.

      Suppose a dream made a riot active
      And the wardrobe opened to a desert,
      Curtains were the color of a fallen neon sign,
      Carnations broaches at the throat of death.

      Suppose a dream raised the room
      A hundred feet, the garden as a ceiling
      A hundred feet below and the flowers
      Dropped out of the earth and fall like meteors.

      New as a haircut with distant conotations
      Of the sphinx, the princess, and the prism
      The chair eclipses the window and I lie
      Breathless on the lunar moss and wait.

      Cups are craters gouged by early comets,
      Forks symbolise Poseidon's enmity,
      I lie in the rectangle emitted by the sun
      Beyond the reach of kettle, clock, or hinge.
