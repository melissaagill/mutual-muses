      Dearest Sylvia:
      I am so afraid that declarations
      of love may seem repetitious and
      it is a difficulty one encounters if,
      loving strongly and continuously,
      one's only direct communication
      is by means of letters, at best shad-
      ows of what I want to say, and frag-
      ments of my love. Still, letters it
      has to be... And I shall say again
      you are never out of my mind. It
      is a surprise sometimes to realise
      how many places we have been to-
      gether: concrete memories of you are
      evoked by places as far apart as Green-
      wich and Hampton court, Victoria and
      [unclear]Fullers[/unclear] at Wimbledon. And, as to-
      day, the Tate gallery. Though you
      were, my dear Sylvia, very tired
      how well off we were in a way when
      you had your twice weekly excur-
      sion to town. I am not being heart-
      less, really, it was dreadful for
      you I know, but you, too, know
