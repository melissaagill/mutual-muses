      4.
      they feel sure you won't have to wait much longer before getting a good job.
          You will be amused to hear that the Shewells said wouldn't I come to Mrs. May's lecture on modern art at their house on Monday.  I said I would.  My feelings are very mixed - curiosity and boredom for if she is good and lectures at their level it won't interest me, if she is bad I shall be [unclear]pribated[/unclear] - and write down fallacies!  I hope she is "sympatica"!
          When I have finished this I shall go up to the studio and do my still-life - the white one.  I am thinking of another with eggs and chestnuts - with their husks.
