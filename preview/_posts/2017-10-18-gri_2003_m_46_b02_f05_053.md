      Well, I am home, to find your letter. I
      love the way the initial of Sylvia curls
      round my pronoun. What I have done is
      look at the portraits again and seen, for the
      first time, the landscape which I think is
      very good. It is a splendid and exciting
      sky and I think the drawing of the
      narrow landscape beautifully compact &
      well-explained. I long for morning so I
      can see the colours properly. Apart from the
      thrill of seeing a new work by you (and,
      darling, this never lessens) I was pleased
      (and not in the least surprised) to find our
      portraits every bit as good as memory told me
      they were.

      My journey was not bad because I spent
      most of it writing to you and all of it think-
      ing of you. I got home at 10.15 - just
      three hours after I left you - or, rather,
      when the bus whisked you away. Lionel
      and I have had a cup each of milk but be-
      fore I go to bed I want to say again,
      take care of yourself my own poor creature.
      Be calm, my dear love.

      I am sure I shall dream of you and beside
      you a muse at an oval canvas. Beside
      you I will be and though the classic figure
      is Painting I shall be your real inspiration
      as you are mine despite the figure of Rhetoric
      with her [unclear]scroll[/unclear]. I dream of you.....

      VIII

      Blackheath

      Well, I am home, to find your letter.  I
      love the way the initial Sylvia curls
      round my pronoun.  What I have done is
      look at the portraits again and seen, for the
      first time, the landscape which I think is
      very good.  It is a splendid and exciting
      sky and I think the drawing of the
      narrow landscape beautifully compact
      well-explained.  I long for morning so I
      can see the colours properly.  Apart from the
      thrill of seeing a new work by you (and,
      darling, this never lessens) I was pleased
      (and not in the least surprised) to find our
      portraits every bit as good as memory told me
      they were.

      My journey was not had because I spent
      most of it writing to you and all of it think-
      ing of you.  I got home at 10.15 - just
      three hours after I left you - or, rather,
      when the bus whisked you away.  Lionel
      and I have had a cup each of milk but be-
      fore I go to bed I want to say again, take
      care of yourself my own poor creature.
      Be calm, my dear love.

      I am sure I shall dream of you and beside
      you a muse at an oval canvas.  Beside
      you I will be and though the classic figure
      is Painting I shall be your real inspiration
      as you are mine despite the figure of Rhetoric
      with her scale.  I dream of you. . . . .
