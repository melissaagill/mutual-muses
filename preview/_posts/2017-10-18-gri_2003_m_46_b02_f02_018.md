      nice lunch - pork and, then, fruit salad.

      I have found the fragment you liked, which I read to you. It is still unfinished:

      This morning frost
      Made coral flowers
      Of the grass
      And later melting made
      The pavements glass,
      Mirrors to the sun.

      And screens of mist
      Suffused the sun
      Across the sky, across
      The heath's horizon
      Until the house floated
      Like pearls in the sea.

      The third section of our poem is called Eros Speaks, and the last section is a Chorus of Putti. Form is beginning to dominate the numerous images...

      Mrs Gardiner lent me her bicycle this morning and I went to the village and got an Observer which contained, I was pleased to see, my review, which I enclose for you.

      Dearest I hope you are well. I think of you continually.

      I love you
      Lawrence
