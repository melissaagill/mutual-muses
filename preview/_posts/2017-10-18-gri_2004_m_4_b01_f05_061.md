      Blackheath
      9th November 1949

      Dearest Sylvia,

      I am sorry that so many letters of mine have contained catalogues of all the work I am doing. It has prevented me from writing quite as much has I would wish, to you, my dearest one. Do forgive me.

      Your cake was waiting for me when I got home last night. I have not eaten any yet, I was too late, and this morning I am going out in a few minutes, so I shall open it this evening and eat vast pieces of it on my return from Banstead. Thank you, darling, so much for sending it. I fell terribly, wonderfully, spoiled. I shall be very fat, I'm sure, when we meet: four eggs!

      I am glad to hear that you are getting on well with your portrait of the girl: that, and Tiny, make two pictures of yours I have not seen yet. Your Muse is most indignant. Or almost indignant.

      How excited I am about the Kinsington Gallery. I shall go there tomorrow morning, immediately after my N.G. lecture which will be over at 11.30. I shall get there by 12. Think of my arrival, for, assuredly nothing but you and your pictures will be in my thoughts. I shall send Gainsborough the review that same evening so it'll be in time for the next issue.

      I hope that preparations for your lectures are goin smoothly. I am sure they are for I remember how quickly and well we worked together. Oh, that I could be there. I shall think of you my darling and send you my love all the time, be assured of that.

      I love you, madly, intellectually, impulsively, constantly, I love love love you,
      Lawrence

      Dearest Sylvia,

         I am sorry that so many letters of mine have contained catalogues of all the work I am doing. It has prevented me from writing as much as I would wish, to you, my dearest one. Do forgive me.

        Your cake was waiting fr me when I got home last night. I have not eaten any yet, I was too late, and this morning I am going out in a few minutes, so I shall open it this evening and eat vast pieces of it on my return from Banstead. Thank you, darling, so much for sending it. I feel terribly, wonderfully, spoiled. I shall be very fat, I'm sure, when we meet: four eggs!

        I am glad to hear that you are getting on well with your portrait of the girl: that, and Tiny, make two pictures of yours I have not seen yet. Your Muse is most indignant. Or almost indignant.

        How excited I am about Kensington Gallery. I shall go there tomorrow morning, immediately after my N.G. lecture which will be over at 11:30. I shall get there by 12. Think of my arrival, for, assuredly nothing but you and your pictures will be in my thoughts. I shall send Gainsborough the review that same evening so it'll be in tine fr the next issue.

        I hope that preparations for your lectures are going smoothly. I am sure they are for I remember how quickly and well we worked together. Oh, that I could be there. I shall think of you my darling and send you my love all the time, be assured of that.

        I love you, madly, intellectually, impulsively, constantly, I love love love you,
