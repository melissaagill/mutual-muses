           On the one hand the colossal number of statues --[unclear] Farmers[unclear] Hercules, lion and bear in combat,  a [unclear]philopsophy[/unclear], victory triumphs over injustice. On the other the women who look -- almost all of them -- as if they lack quite enough sleep. The 16 de la cite and the little green triangles -- [unclear]e v ert galant more[/unclear] Picasso has painted. Tapestries in the petit palace -- the triumph of [unclear]charity, bc. bc.[/unclear] All of which material remains outside the poem I want to write -- a la [unclear]spalllimaire[/unclear] -- about Paris.
           You remain the indulgent matter and as [unclear]sure[/unclear] do not give your blessing to venture beyond the genre you selected for me.
           The Impressionist Museum by the way is very much finer than i was led to expect. Monet and Manet are well represented and I rate them higher -- much higher than I expected (as intended) to. Degas seems less well represented -- Renoir not really fully but good as far as the examples go. About 24 Pissarros. Only one visit so far so these impressions are provisional but now that the Vienna show is off (today) I am transferring my attention to it. The Grand Gallerie of the Louvre is open now, 2/3 full of Italian work, 1/3 Spanish. Also 2 superb Rogier Van der Weydens. You'll see them all soon of course.

           The milk of the nebulae creeps
           Early over Montparnasse
          The stars are crisp as shrimps
           And I think of Sylvia sleeping
           The other side of a million lamps
