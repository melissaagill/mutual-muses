      Blackheath
      Tuesday
      Dearest Sylvia
      I was away from home this weekend (one night at Magda's, one at Wimbledon) so I missed your letters and unfortunately I do not have time for a full letter now (as I have today's lecture to prepare).
      However let me say at once that I will meet the 10.10 at Charing X on Thursday.
      I will send off the [unclear]sacking[/unclear] this morning: I expect (and hope) that it will reach you in time.
      Your comments on SHANE were very stimulating - much of it I had not thought of. I may write about it, with your help. I am so pleased you liked it.
      Give Diana my love.
      This evening I am going to a programme of art films (& a discussion) at the I.C.A.
      Must fly.
      Until Thursday (I only wish it were - what I first wrote - Wednesday) my love I

      Tuesday Blackheath Dearest Sylvia
      I was away from home this weekend (one night at

      and unfortunately I do not have time for a full letter
      now (as I have today's lecture to prepare).

      However let me say at once that I will meet the
      10:10 at Claring X on Thursday.

      I will send off the [unclear][/unclear] this morning: I expect
      (and hope) that it will reach you in time.

      Your comments on SHANE were very stimulating -
      much of it I had not thought of. I may write about
      it, with your help. I am so pleased you liked
      it.

      Give Diana my love.
      This evening I am going to a programme of art

      Must fly.

      Until Thursday (I only wish it were -
      what I first wrote - Wednesday) my love. I

      I love you

      Blackheath
      Tuesday
      Dearest Sylia
      I was away from home this weekend (one night at
      Magda's, one at Wimbledon) so I missed your letter
      and unfortunately I do not have time for a full letter
      now (as I have today's lecture to prepare).
      However let me say at once that I will meet the
      10.10 at Charing X on Thursday.
      I will send off the sacking this morning:  I expect
      (and hope) that it will reach you in time.
      Your comments on SHANE were very stimulating--
      much of it I had not thought of.  I may write about
      it, with your help.  I am so pleased you liked
      it.
      Give Diana my love.
      This evening I am going to a grogramme of art
      films (and a discussion) at the ICA.
      Must fly.
      Until Thursday (I only wish it were--
      what I first wrote--Wednesday) my love.  I
      am dying to be with you.
      I love you

                      Blackheath                   [11-9-53]
                        Tuesday
      Dearest Sylvia

      I was away from home this weekend (one night at Magda's, one at Wimbledon) so I missed your letters and unfortunately I do not have time for a full letter now (as I have today's lecture to prepare).

      However let me say at once that I will meet the 10.10 at Charing X on Thursday.

      I will send off the [unclear]sacking[/unclear] this morning : I expect (and hope) that it will reach you in time.

      Your comments on SHANE were very stimulating - much of it I had not thought of. I may write about it, with your help. I am so pleased you liked it.

      Give Diana my love.

      This evening I am going to a programme of art films (& a discussion) at the ICA.
      Must fly.

      Until Thursday (I only wish it were - what I first wrote - Wednesday) my love. I am dying to be with you
                                 love you
                                 Lawrence
