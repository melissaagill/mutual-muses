      I hope you had a nice
      tea-party with Pasmore,
      that the sash-cord it repaired
      now is good news for it is
      rather dangerous- one can
      catch one's hand.

      ate the Rectory, and you know
      [unclear]where[/unclear] it is when workmen get
      about the place- also they
      will point and repair the gable.
      I have practically finished
