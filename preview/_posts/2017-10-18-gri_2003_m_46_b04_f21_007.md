      Dearest Lawrence
         Thank you for your letter.  I now enclose your chapter.  Tiny has read it and thinks it excellent.  She has two criticisms which I think useful.  Both in the last half of the 1st paragraph.
      "These buildings are Formidable examples of the Perpendicular"  Tiny says "Why Formidable?"  She knows these buildings and does not quite see why the term should be applied to them.  I am inclined to agree with her.  I think you are probably being a little quiloquil (?spelling!) then in the following sentence you go on to discus domestic buildings in such a way as to suggest that the Perpendicular style is not Gothic.  I don't think you mean this though Tiny and I are agreed that it is a transitional style.

      Dearest Lawrence,

      Thank you for your letter. I now enclose your chapter. Tiny has read it and thinks it excellent. She has two criticisms which I think useful. Both in the last half of the 1st paragraph.

      "These buildings are Formidable example of the Perpendicular" Tiny says "why Formidable?" She knows these buildings and does not quite see why the term should be applied to them. I am inclined to agree with her, I think you are probably being a little [unclear][/unclear] then in the following sentence you  go on to discuss domestic buildings in such a way, as to suggest that the Perpendicular style is not gothic - I don't think you mean this though Tiny and I are agreed that it is a Transitional style.
