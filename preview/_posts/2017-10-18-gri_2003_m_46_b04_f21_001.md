      Dearest Lawrence,

      Thank you for your letter which Tiny brought to me while I was working alone in the studio putting in the flowers on Mary - Jane's frock. I have just finished the water-colour. Mary-J. is reclining on the sofa eyeing the spectator. I am pleased with it - particularly the cushions on the sofa!

      The rain is [unclear][/unclear] - I fear all the stocks that are left in the fields will be quite spoiled - we have been forced to put basins at various levels under the sky-light, so there are varying "tings" at intervals as one passes.

      I am very much hoping that Desiree will come on Monday but I am afraid her mother may not allow it.

      I shall come on the 13th, perhaps

      Pett
      Dearest Lawrence,
      Thank you for your letter which Tiny brought to me while I was working alone in the studio putting in the flowers on Mary-Jane's frock.  I have just finished the water-colour.  Mary-J. is reclining on the sopha eyeing the [unclear]spectats[/unclear]  I am please with it - particularly the cushions on the  sopha!
      The rain is deluging - I fear all the stacks that are left in the fields will be quite spoiled - We have been forced to put basins out various levels under the sky-light.  So there are varying "tings' at intervals as one passes.
      I am very much hoping that Desiree will come on Monday but I am afraid her mother may not allow it.
      I shall come on the 13th, perhaps
