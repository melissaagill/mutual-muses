      Dearest Sylvia
      To judge from your note you are enjoying the Hicks' visit. I am glad of that. Which National Trust House are you hoping to visit? I hope you get in. On Sunday I am going to Luton Hoo myself. From the name it must be an [unclear]earl's[/unclear] stately home.
      Today Monica, Peter Kinley, and little Pete are coming out for the afternoon. I am rather looking forward to their visit and it leaves me the morning free for work. Today is the last day Monica is free as her holiday is coming to an end. Then this evening Pasmore is expecting me: after dinner, unfortunately.
      No I have not talked to the publications department yet. There is no point as Le Roux is away now that the director is back.
      Mother is away this weekend so Father is going to come to my lecture (Van Gogh) and then we shall see a film afterwards. I think perhaps Lili - the new Lesley Caron film. Or possibly ARENA - a 3D Western may be on. We'll see.....
      I have read a 'novel' by L. Ron Hubbard: a quasi-science-fiction adventure story. It is the same Hubbard who invented DIANETICS. You know, his psychology undermines my faith in his fiction.
      I adore you and miss you very  much.
      I love you
      Lawrence
