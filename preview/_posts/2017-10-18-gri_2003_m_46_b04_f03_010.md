      You say you are tired: do not, my sweetheart,
      do too much work.  No, I have it wrong: you
      say, in your letter, you are 'rushed'.  I still
      say - don't work too hard.  Are you bathing -
      the weather is so nice, today as yesterday?

      I must rush myself & meet Parrons.  He is
      due here at 9:40 - at the station.  I will
      write again tomorrow.

      I love you
      Lawrence
