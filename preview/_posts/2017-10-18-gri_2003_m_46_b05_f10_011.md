      Lincoln 2 x 1952 Dearest Sylvia
      Rain increased as the train went North. As the last light failed preisely
      we readed Lincoln. I crossed a foot bridge - high in the wet, dark, - making
      out a romantic railway station, and, beyond a car park, the Grand Hotel
      where I am staying. It is a Georgian - looking building, but so ex-
      tended & added to all sense of order has disappeared. The waiter at
      dinner, asked if it was still raining: so remote is the dining room from
      the open air he could not tell. However intricate and diffuse the Hotel
      may be, the bed is soft, the water is hot, and dinner was excel-
      lent (grilled steak & mushrooms.) I believe I shall be comfortable here

      I shall continue with this letter later on. I must find the school
      now for a special performance of the art films that is being put on for me at
      9:00. My first sight of this city it will be wet, dark, totally strange
      as I look out from under my unbrella - like a portable redicular struc-
      ture, protecting the enquirer.

      3 x 1952
      I slept so badly last night that I might as well have gone to a party for
      all the rest I got.
      I saw the films last night: one, Images Mediavale, is very good - a
      technicolor microcasmm of med. likfe and belief drawn from [unclear][/unclear] in the
      Billie theque Nationals. Color is excellent. Van Gough is a nulgar at-
      tempt to convey his state of mind through bits of his pictures. Matirse, as
      you know, is excellent. Batticelli is simple and not unpleasant.
      La Poulette Grice is itself a work-of-art, not a film about art:
      at least it sets out to be - transformations of ham and egg in all
      kinds of background - theme and variations.

      Lincoln
      2 X 1952
      Dearest Sylvia
      Rain increased as the train went North. As the last light failed precisely
      we reached Lincoln. I crossed a foot bridge - high in the wet dark - making
      out a romantic railway station and, beyond a car park, the Grant Hotel
      where I am staying. It is a Georgian-looking building but so ex-
      tended and added to all sense of order has disappeared. The waiter, at
      dinner, asked if it was still raining: so remote is the dining room from
      the open air he could not tell. However intricate and diffuse the Hotel
      may be, the bed is soft, the water is hot, and dinner was excel-
      lent (grilled steak & mushrooms). I believe I shall be comfortable here.

      I shall continue with this letter later on. I must find the school
      now for a special performance of the art film is being put on for me at
      9.00. My first sight of this city it will be wet, dark, totally strange
      as I look out from under my umbrella - like a portable aedicula struc-
      ture, protecting the enquirer.

      3 X 1952
      I slept so badly last night that I might as well have gone to a party for
      all the rest I got.
      I saw the films last night: one, Images Medievales, is very good - a
      technicolor microcosm of med. life and belief drawn from IL. MSS in the
      Bibliotheque Nationale. Color is excellent. Van Gogh is a vulgar at-
      tempt to convey his state of mind thru bits of his pictures. Matisse, as
      you know, is excellent. Botticelli is simple and not unpleasant.
      La Poulette Grise is itself a work-of-art, not a film about art:
      at least it sets out to be - transformations of hen and egg in all
      kinds of background - theme and variations.
      Well it is nearly 8.00: I must write out a few notes and then
      go down to breakfast. I will continue with this whenever I get
      an opportunity, my love.
