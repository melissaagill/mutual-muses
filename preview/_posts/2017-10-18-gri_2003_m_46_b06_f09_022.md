      Frank played me the Ravel-Colette opera L'Enfant et les Sortileges.
      I have wanted to hear it ever since I read Melanie Klein on it in one
      of Clifford's books. It is marvellous: witty, lucid, elegant, [unclear]forainl[/unclear]
      lyrical. Frank says it is the kind of effect he hopes for
      with The Travel Agent.

      TUESDAY
      Thank you for your letter today. I now understand the necessity of
      telling Georgie. I am so glad that she was understanding: I am most
      impressed by your account of her hearing for it was a serious matter
      for her to hear about. I am glad that you slept well afterwards:
      you certainly deserved to, after such an upsetting conversation.
      My Smith lecture went exceptionally well. A complete change of sub-
      ject is like a visit to the sea: stimulating. I got several laughs -
      in the right places, also.
      I must make a few notes on my next lecture while I'm in the gal-
      lery so I should close now.
      I am dying to see you. I love and adore you
      love you
      Lawrence
