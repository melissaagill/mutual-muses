      The lecture yesterday went well as I had a long time to prepare it in. Charles was very dreary but the psychiatrist was interesting: his name is adapted from an East European original - and now stands as Dr. Pearce. He is on the staff of Stonehouse at Dartford. Though not a Freudian he gave me much useful information and he is a charming, well-bred man. (I had much to drink!) We went through many drawings by the insane and - indistinguishable - a few of the nurses who watch over the class. Neither Pearce's grave doubts nor my ironical ones could dispell the idea, shared by C.J., Mary Openheim, & Celia Bedford, that schizophrenia was contagious. Measles is more of a risk - except to the three neurotics just named. He has a handsome wife whom you would have liked, I think. Oh my dearest, why do I have to waste my life by spending part of it away from you!

      I have had a letter from Sylvester inviting me to take part in a discussion of critics at the I.C.A. on Helion & Buffet. It is unpaid but I think worth it from a social point of view. It is the Thursday after the Wednesday that I am going to the Hampstead Artists' Council. Banstead on Tuesday and Clifford's lecture on Monday. I wish that that week were less crowded as you may be here but what can I do ? I take it that you would want me to accept the I.C.A. invitation?

      I enclose two poems and, dearest creature, all my love.

      I love you

      Lawrence

      The lecture yesterday went well as I had a long time to prepare
      it in. Charles was very dreary but the psychiatrist was inter-
      esting: his name is adapted from an East European original -
      and now stands as Dr. Pearce. He is on the staff of Stone House
      at Dartford. Though not a Freudian, he gave me much use-
      ful information and he is a charming, well-bred mam. (I had
      much to drink!) We went through many drawings & its in-
      sane and - undistinguishable - a few of the nurses who watch
      over the class. Neither Pearce's grave doubts nor my
      ironical ones could dispell the idea, shared by C.J., Mary
      Openhiem, & Celia Bedford, that schizophrenia was contag-
      gious. Measles is more than a risk - except to the three
      neurotiss just named. He has a handsome wife whom you
      would have liked, I think. Oh mh dearest, why do I
      have to waste my life by spending part of it away from
      you!
      I have had a letter from Sylvester inviting me to take part
      in a discussion of critics at the I.C.A. on Helian &
      Buffet. It is unpaid but I think worth it from a social
      point of view. It is the Thursday after the Wednesday that
      I am going in the Hampstead Artists Council. Banstead
      on Tuesday and Clifford's lecture on Monday. I wish that
      that week were less crowded as you may be here but
      what can I do? I take it that you would want me
      to accept the I.C.A. invitation?
      I enclose two poems and, dearest creature, all
      my love.  I love you
      Lawrence
