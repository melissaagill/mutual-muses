      V & A 29 XI
      On Sunday Paul Southey was delighted to see the framed and finished Ajax & the poet - he studied it for, surely, 15 minutes, praising your consistency and your boldness. He liked, also, Hetty as a bride, considering it (with Thetis & Ajax) to be the best works of yours he has seen. It would take up much space in this letter to repeat his individual appreciation (I will, however, when we meet) but I thought you would like to know of his enthusiasm. I am writing in the V & A which, like everywhere else, saddens me because it reminds me of past meetings but, on the other hand, and pleases me because your [unclear][/unclear] images in mending [unclear][/unclear] me. Best to be with you; best, when I am alone, to think of your grace & beauty. As dearest Sylvia - I love you so much. I have some more poems but they are not yet fit for a cat - so I shall revise them when I get a chance.
      I hope you are [unclear][/unclear] and painting well. Take care of yourself, my rose,
      I adore you
      Lawrence.
