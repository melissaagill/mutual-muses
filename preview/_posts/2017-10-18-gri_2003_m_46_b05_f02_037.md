      Thursday Wimbledon

      Dearest Sylvia

      Molly has just been in to see Mother and we had time for a short talk. She told me how much she enjoyed meeting you again. She said she was 'shameless' in staying on and on, but did not want to go. (Also she was most impressed by your industriousness - washing blankets, and so on.)

      Speaking of your industry I wonder if you find much work is necessary on your part of the Rectory. I envisage my Cat in her working bonnet surrounded by sweepers, mops, dusters, tins - in the centre of a billowing cloud of dust. Your expression is - determined.

      LYNNE COURT,

      BOURNEMOUTH.
      Wimbledon
      Thursday
      Dearest Sylvia
      Molly has just been in to see Mother
      and we had time for a short talk.  She
      told me how much she enjoyed meeting
      you again.  She said she was "shame-
       less" in staying on and on, but did not
      want to go.  (Also she was most impress-
      ed by your inductiveness--washing
      blankets, and so on.)
      Speaking of your industry I wonder if
      you find much work is necessary on
      your part of the Rectory.  I envisage my
      cat in her working bonnet surrounded
      by sweepers, mops, dusters, tins--in
      the centre of a billowing cloud of dust.
      Your expression is determined.
