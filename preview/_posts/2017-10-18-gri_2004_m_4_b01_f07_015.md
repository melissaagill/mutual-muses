      BLACKHEATH 31 iii 1950
      Dearest Sylvia, How good to talk with you this morning, for so long a time which yet passed, for me, so quickly.  Here are three poems for you, my Muse who inspires me so generously.  I must thank you for them, my love.  Today the poet in his landscape, Landscape with telephones, Remembers the blue duel of the boats, The women in the trains at night, The rattle of the couplings, And burning names of biscuits Visionary in the sky.  My love is nearer by a world: Streets could hide her by a block, A pause at red-eyed traffic-lights Might be fatal to a meeting.  All the houses should wear blue plaques Saying 'your love is here, or near', oh where, In the labyrinthine city, love.  TWO When the stars creak like trees in the wind And the floor mumbles its age And you cannot reach the switch To put off the light in your mind Let lions take the place of sheep And blow dust back in the past's face And persuade to honeyed peace My wakeful beauty: let lions fill your sleep  THREE Spring is not academic, A footnote or a time Fixed in the almanac Past which there is no rime.  Nor quite the rising heads of daffodils that hear The song of birds With their long yellow ears.  Spring is the time we meet, In garden, room, or street,, For images, then, fly Like flowers from your hair, Like birds from my thighs Growing into air.  I love, dearest Sylvia, I love you Lawrence

    annotation_text: "[31 iii 1950] BLACKHEATH \n\nDearest Sylvia,\n\nHow good to
      talk with you this morning, for so long a time which \nyet passed, for me, so
      quickly. Here are three poems for you, \nmy Muse who inspires me so generously.
      I must thank you for \nthem, my love.\n\nToday the poet in his landscape,\nLandscape
      with telephones,\nRemembers the blue duel of the boats,\nThe women in the trains
      at night,\nThe rattle of the couplings,\nAnd burning names of biscuits\nVisionary
      in the sky.\n\nMy love is nearer by a world:\nStreets could hide her by a block,\nA
      pause at red-eyed traffic-lights\nMight be fatal to a meeting.\nAll the houses
      should wear blue plaques\nSaying 'your love is here, or near', oh where,\nIn
      the labyrinthine city, love.\n\nTWO\nWhen the stars creak like trees in the
      wind\nAnd the floor mumbles its age\nAnd you cannot reach the switch\nTo put
      off the light in your mind\nLet lions take the place of sheep\nAnd blow dust
      back in the past's face\nAnd persuade to honeyed peace\nMy wakeful beauty: let
      lions fill your sleep\n\nTHREE\nSpring is not academic,\nA footnote or a time\nFixed
      in the almanac\nPast which there is no rime.\nNor quite the rising heads\nOf
      daffodils that hear\nThe song of birds\nWith their long yellow ears.\nSpring
      is the time we meet,\nIn garden, room, or street,\nFor images, then, fly\nLike
      flowers from your hair,\nLike birds from my thighs\nGrowing into air.\n\nI love
      you, dearest Sylia,\nI love you,\nLawrence"
