      a Danish lamp shade, a modern shaped table, paper mache table, Victorian chairs, bookshelves each side of the fire - the [unclear]whole[/unclear] recessed, of course - Georgia bookcase [unclear]secretaries[/unclear] radio, and so on. The ground floor is this shape, roughly:

      The living room has beams. There is hardly room for more.

      Elevation is roughly like this (I only saw it for a moment in the dark, remember.)

      The suburb as a whole look interesting: I must take a journey out there when it is [unclear]fine[/unclear].

      I don't know what happens in this corner.

      I heard yesterday - Saturday - that I have not seen successful in my Kenwood application. I feel surprised and depressed: not to even get on the short list, goddamn it!

      Well I have finished lunch with bananas & chocolate biscuits and milk. Now I must do some writing.

      I love you so mush, so very much.

      I adore you,
