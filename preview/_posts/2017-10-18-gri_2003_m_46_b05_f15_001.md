      I suppose that he is very busy now as he was at the Watergate.  I shall be interested

      quite confident now in any case.  I am glad that you have 3 lectures going -
      Westcliff is not very far either.  I hope the Turner went well - I imagine that

      Dearest Lawrence,
      I am glad Paul came to see you
      I suppose that he is very busy now,
      as he was at the Watergate.  I shall
      be interested to hear his experiences.  I
      hope he will be able to show with me,
      but I feel quite confident now in any
      case.
      I am glad that you have 3 lectures
      going.  Westcliff is not very far either.
      I hope the Tower went well--I imagine
      that you had a good attendance for that.
      I can't read the subject of your Tate
      Lecture of Tuesday, it looks like cushion!
      I gather that whether the money comes
      or not I shall not be able to come
      until Thursday.  I imagine Friday will
      be the day.
      I think you should be complimented
      that Smith is furious--that he cares what
      you think.  I think he should be
      grateful to be mentioned--publicity
