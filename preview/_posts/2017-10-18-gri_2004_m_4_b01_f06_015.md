      I have been to the V and A this morning, getting slides, and home now. Just been looking again at the water-colours. I am about to see somebody at Christies and then of course see John Shipp.

      Paul and I went to the lecture last night. It was awful - Central European, Jurgian, alchemaical, etc. The lecturer's name was Philip Metman. I was, need I say, conspicuous in the discussion! Would I had had your indignant, polemical companionship!

      I will write a fuller letter later. Now I must fly.

      I love you, Lawrence
