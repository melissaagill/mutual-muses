      I have sent off the Welsh application. It will

      monials but I am within the time-limit. Also,
      I have written for the Geffrye Museum forms.
      I saw Paul H yesterday and he is still with-
      out a job, but he has a [unclear]claim[/unclear] of working on a
      film, notably, as a cutter, in about 3 months
      time.
      Have you been resting properly, my love?
      I do hope that you have felt able to relax.
      And I am sure that Harvey's Memoirs are ideal
      reading - just the thing to charm and soothe
      one. Let me know full details of your health,
      dearest. Are you sleeping better? (last

    clean_transcription: Dearest Sylvia, <br/>I have sent off the Welch application.
      It will arrive today. I was delayed by one of the testi-monials but I am within
      the time-limit. Also, I have written for the Geffrye Museum forms. <br/>I saw
      Paul H yesterday and he is still with-out a job, but he has a chance of working
      on a  film, most likely, as a cutter, in about 3 months time. <br/><br/>Have
      you been resting properly, my love? I do hope that you have felt able to relax.
      And I am sure that Harvey's Menoin are ideal reading -- just the thing to charm
      and soothe one. Let me know full details of your health, dearest. Are you sleeping
      better? (last night -- at last -- I did.)
