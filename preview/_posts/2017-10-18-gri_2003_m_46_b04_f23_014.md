      Dearest Lawerence,
        We all thought of you and talked of you often on Friday - and we firmly believe that if you should not get the job it will be because someone with influence did! I'm sure you were excellent at your interview.
      Yes do tell me good or bad news as soon as you know - perhaps making the difference that you will speed the good !
        Jimmy sends his love and is very much looking forward to seeing you - certainly we need a bit of brightening up here I have felt rather gloomy myself - I shall feel better when I have started my painting - I have sized and prepared the canvas and shall tighten it up tomorrow - I have borrowed the "[unclear] iron" from  une Halet [/unclear] it is most elegant - I am ashamed of the travesty I
