      eyes, writing a poem, retreating, then adding a few more words. Soon I shall put out the light, in the hope of sleep. Would you were here: I have not had a chance to see the town yet (except for the Art Gallery) but I believe you would like it. But even if it were Walne Hampton I should wish you here for I love you so much.
      I think my lectures were successful - to juniors and seniors (about 250-300 in all) and to the parents and adults in the evening (ca 200 of them). It was interesting to act as compere to the films ( I thought now what would Mansbridge have done? and reversed it). The children were attentive and I believe some effect may have been made on some of them. Klee's They're Biting was a great success until the 11-13 year olds. The teachers get interested, unfortunately, and ask questions which the children cannot follow or, sometimes, criticise modern art. I can deal with this but it is a radical mistake on the teachers' part I think - but you know teachers!
      The principle of the art school has a 15 year old boy at the moment who wrote JIORA DISGNE, then crossed out the second word & substituted DIRCES. This was his attempt at the words Junior Design [unclear]didated [/unclear]to the [unclear]clars[/unclear]. He draws almost everything with 2 heads: but everything - NO suspicion in the teacher's mind of any psychological problem, as far as I could see.
      Sleep now. I love you. Good night.
      Saturday
      I slept very well (I hope you did).
      Must rush now to see as much of the town as possible (the headmistress has lent me a [unclear][/unclear] for the misericord (sp?) - the cathedral. Catching the 4.45 to town
      I love you

      eyes, writing a poem, retreating, then adding a few more words.
      Soon I shall put out the light, in the hope of sleep. Would you
      were here: I have not had a chance to see the town yet (except
      for the Art gallery) but I believe you would like it. But even if
      it were Wolverhampton I should wish you here for I love you so
      much.

      I think my lectures were successful - to juniors and seniors (about
      250 - 300 in all) and to the parents and adults in the evening (ca 200
      of them). It was interesting to act as compere to the films (I thought
      now what would Mansbridge have done? and reversed it). The
      children were attentive and I believe some effect may have been made on
      some of them. Klee's They're Biting was a great success with th 11-13
      year olds. The teachers get interested, unfortunatley, and ask questions
      which the children cannot follow or, sometimes, criticise modern art.
      I can deal with this but it is a tactical mistake on the teacher's part
      I think - but you know teachers!

      The principle of the art school has a 15 year old boy at the moment
      who wrote JIORA DISGNE, then crossed out the second word
      & substitued DIRCES. This was his attempt at the words
      Junior Design dictated to the class. he draws almost everything
      with 2 heads: but everything - No suspicion on the teacher's mind
      of any psyclological problem, as far as I could see.
      Sleep now. I love you. Good night.

      Saturday
      I slept very well (I hope you did).
      Must rush now to see as much of the town as possible (the
      headmistress has lent me a [unclear]torch[/unclear] for the miseriacords (sp?) - the
      cathedral. Catching the 4:45 to town.
      I love you
      Lawrence
