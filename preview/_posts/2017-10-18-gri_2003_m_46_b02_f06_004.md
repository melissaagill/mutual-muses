      me from cover with an incredibly long
      paw.
      One corrolation last night was to hear
      Debussy's string Quartet- and one by
      Hindemith- though reception was
      best for the first piece.
      Wally and Eric are away for their
      holidays (at St. Margaret's Bay) so
      I don't think I shall be able to get
      our picture though I am going to
      try. It seems they have a lodger.
      He may be able to get me into the
      studio. Oh, I hope so.
       You were quite right about my par-
      ents' reception of the post card of the
      interior of the [underline] Palazzo Oucale [/underline] My mother thought it 'horrible' I am sure Michael will be more appreciative of the catalogue you have taken! Does Castiglione d'olara arouse his appetite?

      me from cover with an incredibly long paw.

      One consolation last night was to hear Debussy's String Quartet - and one by Hindemith - though reception was best for the first piece.

      Molly and Eric are away for their holidays (at St. Margaret's Bay) so I don't think I shall be able to get our pictures though I am going to try. It seems they have a lodger. He may be able to get me into the studio. Oh, I hope so.

      You were quite right about my parents'reception of the postcard of the interior of the Palazzo Ducale. My mother thought it 'horrible'. I am sure Michael will be more appreciative of the [unclear]catalogues[/unclear] you have taken! Does Castiglione d'Olona arouse his appetite?
