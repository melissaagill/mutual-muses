      What a shame that the daffodils have not turned out well but I hope that your other pictures are successful. How nice that you should paint my 'tomato' wall after all, though from another angle to my attempt.

We will prepare a vast store of sundries - in all colors:  [unclear]Lavalla[/unclear] Hood shall serve them, Sylvia on lionel chat's right hand shall eat half of them from our new plates while lionel & Dandylion share the other half.  Perhaps a crumb for [unclear] Lavalla[/unclear] if he is good enough.  It is a feast I look forward to.
