      I love you so much and long for our life together. I want to record our pleasure and express our love in poem after poem. My dearest love your love has done so much for me. My magnificent creature you are love, you are adored.

      Dandylion thank you for the melting moments which he ate in the train amid envious glaces from his fellow travellers.

      I have typed out the Poussin information for Michael in as Poussinesque a manner as I can and put it on a separate sheet so you can give it him easily.

      I hope you well again. I love you. Lawrence
