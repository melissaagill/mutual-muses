      EPICEDE FOR KATHARINE A. ESDAILE

      What irregular admixture
      Of the elements could so corrupt
      This scholar as to rob Nature
      Of the chronicler who kept
      Death pinned to the pages of Cesare Ripa,
      Recording the menu of Death's dry supper.

      Too much of earth, perhaps, to keep
      This scholar from her quest of death:
      Too much water that she had to weep,
      Learned tears like the dust that takes by stealth.
      Now, alas, I fear she cannot tell
      The worm from the obelisk with the flame finial.

      Melancholy obsequies,
      Put purple on the consoles for a year,
      Consider the escutcheon:
      Monumental effigies,
      Summon a mystical tear
      For her who enters the limestone pantheon.

      Musical and singing putti,
      Keep back fearful Silence
      Wit her snakes that writhe and flutter:
      Carry to Inteligence
      This donor of erudition, from her bier
      To the harmonious heavenly spheres.

      Forgetfulness is a primitive tribal custom,
      In the Flux beyond recorded history,
      Thant desolate plaque with anonymous barrows
      Where death is shapeless as a flood or phantom.
      Against oblivion in the morbid future
      I write a name in the foxed register of history,
      The name of Esdaile and the summer that borrows
      The date nineteen-fifty from her figured contour.

      By memory we can outwit
      Death who would level
      The moron and the scholor:
      Complex as a jesuit
      The living must rebel
      Against the Avatar.

      EPICEDE FOR KATHARINE A. ESDAILE

      What irregular admixture
      Of the elements could so corrupt
      This scholaras to rob Nature
      Of the chronicler who kept
      Death pinned to the pages of Cesare Ripa,
      Recording the menu of Death's dry supper.

      Too much of earth, perhaps, to keep
      This scholar from her quest of death:
      Too much water that she had to weep,
      Learned tears like the dust that takes by stealth.
      Now, alas, I fear she cannot tell
      The worm from the obelisk with the flame finial.

      Melancholy obsequies,
      Put purple on the consoles for a year,
      Consider the escutcheon:
      Monumental effigies,
      Summon a mystical tear
      For her who enters the limestone pantheon.

      Musical and singing putti,
      Keep back fearful Silence
      Wit her snakes that writhe and flutter:
      Carry to Intelligence
      This donor of erudition, from her bier
      To the harmonious heavenly spheres.

      Forgetfulness is a primitive tribal custom,
      In the flux beyond recorded history,
      That desolate plaque with anonymous barrows
      Where death is shapeless as a flood or phantom.
      Against oblivion in the morbid future
      I write a name in the foxed register of history,
      The name of Esdaile and the summer that borrows
      The date nineteen-fifty from her figured contour.

      By memory we can outwit
      Death who would level
      The moron and the scholar:
      Complex as a jesuit
      The living must rebel
      Against the Avatar.
