      TRAJAN'S COLUMN FOUR
      clothe the writings of... Horace and Cicero in gothic characters
      wourl have been inappropriate'. However, this is an age in which
      Horace is, to the majority, a character created by Harry Hemsley,
      a comedian, and to many Cicero is the code name of a secret agent.
      Mr West feels it necessary, for example, to refer to 'the poet
      Petrarch' and Mr Fairbank writes William Morris, 'poet and artist-
      craftsman'. Apparently these names are insufficiently familiar
      to stand by themselves.
      The Renaiasance standard of firm grace and lucidity ex-
      pressed a total attitude to life, which continued when the writer
      put down his pen. This is not the case today. Though one's
      good will is with the handwriting reformers, one needs to recog-
      nise, in view of the importance placed on it
      by these writers, the humanistic root of the revival. But with-
      out the society and ideals of the Renaissance what does the
      adoption of its handwriting amount to? The revival is nostalgic:
      it does not come to terms with that essential monster, the machine.
      It is a problem which art teachers may need to consider, sooner
      or later. Whereas italic in a graceful dependent of the revival
      of classical culture most modern art teaching in the schools is
      non - or anti-classicla. Whether the duality is unimportant or
      disturbing, and if the letter, what should be done about it, is
      an open question.
