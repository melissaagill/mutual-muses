      in<br/>Rummage this year, I got a <br/>nice skirt (it fits!) and something<br/>that
      will make a good blouse -<br/>and my usual jumper and<br/>cardigan so I am set
      up!<br/>I'm so glad you had a party<br/>I know how you enjoy them -<br/>I am
      most amused by your<br/>account of the wild film -<br/>There was a glowing review
      in<br/>"The Times". I thought it would<br/>be most unsuitable for the cinema.<br/>It
