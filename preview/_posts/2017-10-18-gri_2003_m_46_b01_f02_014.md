      Wednesday
      Hotel de l'Avenue
      Rue [unclear]Jai-Lussac[/unclear]
      My dearest Sylvia
      Today is Wednesday and I cannot see you. I cannot
      tell you how melancholy I am: there is nothing [unclear]Georgion[/unclear]-
      esque about my melancholy, it is very fierce. I want you
      here desperately. Looking back down a perspective of Wed-
      nesdays there is only you. Ahead? Well, how very uncertain
      it is until June. I love you, Sylvia. Everything reminds
      me of you, driving home my sense of loss. I'm so glad I
      have your locket.
      At present we are quite near to [unclear]Luxembourg[/unclear] Gardens.
      (This in itself is a constant reminder of you.) We started
      at the Hotel d'[unclear]St. Iene[/unclear], which was too expensive and are now at a Hotel de [unclear]l'Arenis[/unclear] which is rather seedy at a 130+a
      day for double room. Don't write me here because I am
      doubtful about staying here. If you write to me c/o
      Thos. Cooks & Sons, 2 Place de la Modelaine, Paris,
      I will get your letters.
      How are you? I suppose you are nearly as sad as I am
      though you have the familiar movement of life at Pett to re-
      assure you. I hope Michael is well and happy (I expect he is)

      Lussac<br/>My dearest Sylvia<br/>Today is Wednesday and I cannot see you.  I
      cannot<br/>tell you how melancholy I am:  there is nothing giorgion-<br/>esque
      about my melancholy, it is very fierce.  I want you <br/>here desperately.  Looking
      back down on perspective of Wed-<br/>nesdays there is only you.  Ahead?  Well,
      how very uncertain <br/>it is until June.  I love you, Sylvia.  Everyday reminds<br/>me
      of you, drives home my sense of ease.  I''m so glad I<br/>have your locket.<br/>At
      present we are quite near Luxembourg gardens.<br/>(This in itself is a constant
      reminder of you.)  We started<br/>at the Hotel de l Sitenes, which was too expensive
      and are now<br/>at the Hotel de l''  which is rather seedy at a 130+ a<br/>day
      for double room.  Don''t write me here because I am<br/>doubting about staying
      here.  If you write to me c/o <br/>Thos, Cooks & Sons, 2 Place de La Modelaine,
      Paris,<br/>I will get your letter.<br/>How are you?  I suppose you are nearly
      as sad as I am<br/>cause you have the familiar movement of eye N Pott to re-<br/>assure
      you.  I hope Michael is well and happy (I expect he is)'
