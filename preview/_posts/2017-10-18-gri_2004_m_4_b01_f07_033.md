      Sunday Blackheath
      Dearest Sylvia,

      I am so glad to hear that you are better now.  I
      hope, too, that you are sleeping well.  Today (I am
      writing in the morning) is fine so far: I imagine
      Pett must be charming just now.  Will you be able to
      catch the blossom this year?

      Your telegram came yesterday, less than an hour
      after you had sent it.  I had just that moment com-
      pleted patching the frame with alabastine.  Chipping
      the stuff from my  hair, I went down and received your
      telegram.  Despite all my work I am glad something
      else is coming, something that will, I hope, do jus-
      tice to your nice pitcher.

      How curious you are, telling me promply after re-
      ceiving the cutting from the Herald-Tribune that the
      man who praised me was wooly...

      Yesterday I completed the Rake and today, after an
      early lunch, I shall start on another chapter.  I have
      hopes of getting two completed today, but this may be
      too optimistic.

      Bernard Gay, a member of the exhibition committee
      at the A.I.A., may, I think, be willing to make a mob-
      ile for me, so perhaps we shall have some delicate con-
      struction elegantly rotating and shifting agong your
      beautiful coloured worlds.  (We have just the draught
      for a mobile...)

      Hetty has been tending your flowers, she will not
      trust Dandy with them, and the flowering begonia is now
      fully out and looks very pretty.

      Yawolla came in yesterday while Dandy was working on
