      Blackheath

      Tuesday

      Dearest Sylvia,

      I hope you are well and strong. Your letters shame mine on this occasion. I shall try and make it up a little in this one.

      Fancy your reading the Cocktail Party so quickly and so very promptly. I do not think the most modern cat could do more. How dare you complain in future of being out-o-touch or not up-to-date. Must you read it, again? That seems very determined of you.

      After reading some Joyce I want to ring some changes on the titles of TSE's play: for example, The Cocktail Poortea, or Kicktail Plenty, or Cookedall Partings.

      Joyce review goes, I am sorry to say, very slowly: I am still blundering about with numerous fragments I have written. It is not yet a coherent review. I have found it very hard to concentrate: I have, to use your phrase, "contemplated" Hogarth, but that is all. It is a slack uncreative lion at the moment. However, here are two poems, though I am not confident of them:

      All sugar of a smile
      The window of desire
      Open to vidid carpets
      Of flowered odalisques

      All sugar in a mouth
      My vivid feline city
      Where spoons of clocktowers taste
      The pleasures of a room

      All sugar of the night
      Stars scattered through trees
      My overdressed nude
      Discard your habits of fear.

      No, I revoke my judgment above. Typing this poem, written a day or two day, I am quite pleased with it. Here is the other:

      The rhetoric of waterfalls and empires,
      Elaborate as Bacchus' Indian sunrise,
      Large statements of the weather and of progress,
      Loving repetition of heraldic certainties,
      Obscure the shades of meaning indirection

      Blackheath

      Tuesday

      Dearest Sylvia

      I hope you are well and strong. Your letters shame mine on this occasion. I shall try and make it up a little in this one.

      Fancy your reading the Cocktail Party so quickly and so very promptly. I do not think the most modern cat could do more. How dare you complain in future of being out-of-touch or not up-to-date. Must you read it, again? That seems very determined of you.

      After reading some Joyce I want to ring some changes on the title of TSE's play: for example, The Cocktail Poortea, or Kicktail Plenty, or Cookedall Partings.

      Joyce review goes, I am sorry to say, very slowly: I am still blundering about with numerous fragments I have written. It is not yet a coherent review. I have found it very hard to concentrate: I have, to use your phrase, 'contemplated' Hogarth, but that is all. It is a slack uncreative lion at the moment. However, here are two poems, though I am not confident of them:

      All sugar of a smile
      The window of desire
      Open to vivid carpets
      Of flowered odalisques

      All sugar in a mouth
      My vivid feline city
      Where spoons of clocktowers taste
      The pleasures of a room

      All sugar of the night
      Stars scattered through trees
      My overdressed nude
      Discard your habits of fear.

      No, I revoke my judgement above. Typing this poem, written a day or two ago, I am quite pleased with it. Here is the other:

      The rhetoric of waterfalls and empires,
      Elaborate as Bacchus' Indian sunrise,
      Large statements of the weather and of progress,
      Loving repetition of heraldic certainties,
      Obscure the shades of meaning indirection

      How dare you complain in future of being out-of-touch or not

      termined of you.

      Kicktail Plenty, or Cookedall Partings.

      It is not yet a coherent review.  I have found it very hard to
