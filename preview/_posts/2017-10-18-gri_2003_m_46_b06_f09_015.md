      Falling is something you do well
      and why not, how can I hurt you?
      Deafened as in a swimming pool,
      fused fingers slob on mandeline.

      Here is a poem to go with another one I wrote about the NEW
      YEAR:

      The coat hanger crucifices
      the coat I've taken off to sit
      in nothing in the room, the night
      free in the window and next room.

      The sacrifice is last year's skin
      Leaving me, the night's good thief,
      free to join the deadest gods
      pinned to the rocks of paradise.

      What I shall do in latest skin
      is what I did in the late day -
      happy in the stolen light.

      And, finally (though there are other less complete poems), a
      poem simply delighting in a number of things:

      The goodlooking world, I take
      that elegant one and all,
      as winning numbers and touched cripples,
      as a mobile of tomorrow's stars.

      So theories of mirrors crack
      and towers are plans not tall
      I fall in dreams but waking stand, happy
      that every phone's a cardinal's ring.

      oh, tour of France of phenomema.

      Although I regret that summer is ending, with this winter I shall
      be earning more money I am sure and we shall be able to be to-
      gether much more. Therefore I look forward to winter this year.

      I love you, dearest Sylvia, love and adore you.
      Lawrence
