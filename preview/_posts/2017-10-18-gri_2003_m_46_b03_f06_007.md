      [unclear]Beachhouse[/unclear]    3 VI MCML

      Dearest Sylvia
      I am so excited by your letter.  My first impulse was to write a letter there and then but I decided to finish typing the Analysis of Beauty  chapters.  This I have done and now hasten to write to you about your pictures.  I think the two landscapes look from your vivid, lively sketches very good indeed.  The spaciousness of 'my' view from the church, with all those interesting architectural objects, is just the subject for you with your gift of creating spaciousness without suppressing individual detail.  The view of the garden with its [unclear]abliquely[/unclear] viewed ground plane, as you look down from the lands, and the circular rhythm of the composition round the flower-bed is, again, exactly the kind of subject you invest with [unclear]perroval [/unclear] feeling and formal discovery.  Your drawings are very clear and a great pleasure to a icon who cannot expect to see the picture themselves for some time.  The clarity and definition of these sketches show that you know exactly what you wish to do - that your (pre-conscious) mind is made up - a state which always produces admirable work.  Oh dear, I hope that does not sound like Dandy to the lecturers.  I am so happy, my masterful painter, that you are working so well and that, in addition, to these landscapes your have prepared the [unclear]right[/unclear] canvas superb.  As the weather today is very wet - I expect it extends to [unclear]P elt[/unclear] - will you start work on it, or on 'Frankie', the subject you reserved for 'a dull afternoon'?  because unless you're more fortunate than I this counts as a dull afternoon.

      Tell Clifford that I am delighted but not in the least surprised by his success at Oxford.  I look forward to fuller details.

      Dearest Sylvia

      I am so excited by your letter, my first impulse was to write a letter there and then but I decided to finish typing the [unclear]Avalyn[/unclear] of Beauty chapter. This I have done and [unclear]raw[/unclear] hasten to write to you about your pictures. I think the two landscapes [unclear]look[/unclear] from your vivid, lively sketches very good indeed. The spaciousness of "my" view from the church, with all [unclear]their[/unclear] interesting architectural object, is just the subject for you with your gift of creating spaciousness without suppressing individual detail. I view of the garden with its [unclear]obliquely[/unclear] viewed ground plane, as your look down from the bank, and the circular rhythm of the composition round the flower - [unclear]red[/unclear] is again, exactly the bird of subject you invest with personal feeling and formal discovery. Your drawings are very clear and a great pleasure to a lion who cannot expect to see the pictures themselves for some time. The clarity and definition of [unclear]their[/unclear] sketches show that you know exactly what you wish to do - that your (unconscious) mind if made up - a state which always produces admirable work. Oh dear, I hope that dog not sound like Dandy the lecturer. I am so happy, my masterful painter, that you are working so well and that, in addition, to these landscapes you have prepared the [unclear]flight[/unclear] canvas. Superb. As the weather today is very wet - I expect it extends to Pett - will you start work on it, or on "Frankie", the subject your reserved for "a dull afternoon"? Because unless your more fortunate than I this counts as a dull afternoon.

      Tell Clifford that I am delighted but not in the least surprised by his success at Oxford. I look forward to fuller details.
