      THE GOLDEN AGE: II (For SYLVIA)

      'Your woman's poet must flow, and stroke the
      ear'. Ben Jonson: News From The New World
      Discover'd In The Moon.

      The painter watches his copyright world:
      A river wandering forgetfully,
      The outskirts of a wood where lovers lie
      Captivated by their soft employment.

      A shepherd makes a song, how, out at sea,
      Like fleurs de lis upon a shield, white sails
      Flashes on the green galaxy.
      Tebaldo eclogues weigh upon his ear.

      A soft wind edging in from the south
      Models the tiny clouds and breathes upon
      The lavish gifts of Flora and dismays
      A sleeping nymph's protective drapery.

      O, landscape of the heat-wave and the rose,
      Venetian heritage and monument.

      (12 x 1948)
