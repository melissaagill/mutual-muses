      response to The Poet is amazingly precise for it was suggested by a pie-tune with, as you said, a low-eye-level.

      Be sure to bring the B M letter by Clifford and lots of painting things. Dandylion will be ready to transport the attributes of his muse to Blackheath.

      I love you, Dearest, and cannot believe the exquisite promise of Tuesday when I shall you again - my marvellous beauty - how I long for you.

      I love you, my dearest, Lawrence
