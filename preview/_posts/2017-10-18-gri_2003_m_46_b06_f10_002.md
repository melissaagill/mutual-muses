      [1953] 4 October Blackheath Dearest Sylvia:
      I miss you very much. I am so glad that you will be back in
      a week's time. I am counting the days and hours until then. I
      hope that the Woods are agreeable and that the Savages are
      pleasant in Diana's absence.

      The film show was the end, so bad! Full of the crudest technique
      and most vulgar opinions. Frank, John, and I ought to be
      able to dominate the entire field. Frank & I have thought of an-
      other subject: Victorian LONDON STATUES, part grave, but
      really satirical. Perhaps with some distortions of the statues.

      Kenneth Martin's show at the hospital of Blighgate was stun-
      ning. He is even better than I thought. The way the mobiles
      humanise the space at the children's ward is impressive and
      exhilerating. Mazda & John came & were very appreciative
      also.

      M was very agreeable on Saturday and his show was good,
      better than he himself felt about it. I enjoyed my visit
      and have done my best to catch my enthusiasm for the show
      in my review. It contains almost all new work - not 1951
      but 1952 and '53, even. I do wish you could have come
      with me to see the show.

      Well, lion must go to bed because, as you know, he has
      a lot to do on Monday: V and A, C.O.I.D. (not
      the C.I.D. please note), and the ICA. Finally the WEA
      at Harpenden. Good night my love.
      I adore you
      Lawrence.

      Blackheath
      4 October

      Dearest Sylvia:
      I miss you very much. I am so glad that you will be back in
      a week's time. I am counting the days and hours until then. I
      hope that the Woods are agreeable and that the Savages are
      pleasant in Diana's absence.
      The film show was the end, so bad! Full of the crudest techniques
      and most vulgar opinions. Frank, John, and I ought to be
      able to dominate the entire field. Frank & I have thought of an-
      other subject: Victorian LONDON STATUES, part grave, but
      really satirical. Perhaps with some distortions of the statues.
      Kenneth Martin's show at the hospital at Highgate was stun-
      ning. He is even better than I thought. The way the mobiles
      humanize the space of the children's ward is impressive and
      exhilarating. Magda & John came & were very appreciative
      also.
      M was very agreeable on Saturday and his show was good,
      better than he himself felt about it. I enjoyed my visit
      and have done my best to catch my enthusiasm for the show
      in my review. It contains almost all new work - not 1951
      but 1952 and '53, even. I do wish you could have come
      with me to see the show.
      Well, lion must go to bed because, as you know, he has
      a lot to do on Monday: Vard A, C.O.I.D. (not
      the C.I.D please note), and the ICA. Finally the WEA
      at Harpenden. Good night my love

      I adore you
      Lawrence
