      In the Train [16-3-49]

      Tuesday
      Dearest Sylvia -
      I hope that you had a comfortable jour-
      ney and that you are not over-tired.
      This is not an easy letter to write. The
      spontaneity of speech - to which I am used -
      tries to bubble up as I write and I cannot
      put the words down just enough.

      I cannot put into words the happiness
      you gave me by being with me and
      I hope that I - despite ineptness at just
      about the division of Time, and your
      anxiety - did please you. I miss you
      but I shall do my best to work hard
      and not waste [unclear]creative[/unclear] energy in melon-
      choly. I am consoled by the fact that
      our love ensures your return.

      My bedtime passed agreeably, I
      ended promptly at 12, flew, and
      caught a train which will get me to [unclear]Har-[/unclear]
      [unclear]penden[/unclear] at about 1.30. No time,
      alas, for lunch today.

      In the Train

      Tuesday

      Dearest Sylvia -

           I hope that you had a comfortable journey and that you are not over-tired.  This is not an easy letter to write.  The spontaneity of speech - to which I am used - tries to bubble up as I write and I cannot put the words down fast enough.

           I cannot put into words the happiness you gave me by being with me I hope that I -- despite ineptness at first about the division of Time, and your anxiety - did please you.  I miss you but i shall do my best to work hard and not waste creative energy in melancholy.  I am consoled by the fact that our love ensures your return.

           My lecture passed agreeably.  I ended promptly at 12, flew, and caught a train which will get me to Harpenden at about 1.30.  No time, alas, for lunch today.

      Tuesday

      Dearest Sylvia --
           I hope that you had a comfortable jour-
      ney and that you are not over-tired.
      This is not an easy letter to write. The
      spontaneity of speech - to which I am used -
      tries to bubble up as I write and I cannot
      put the words down fast enough.
           I cannot put into words the happiness
      you gave me by being with me and
      I hope that I -- despite ineptness at first
      about the division of Time, and your
      anxiety - did please you.   I miss you
      but I shall do my best to work hard
      and not waste creative energy in melan-
      choly.  I am consoled by the fact that
      our love ensures your return.

           My lecture passed agreeably.  I
      ended promptly at 12, flew, and
      caught a train which will get me to [unclear]Man-
      nerden[/unclear] at about 1.[unclear]3[/unclear]0. No time,
      alas, for lunch today.

      Sylvia --<br/>     I hope that you had a comfortable jour-<br/>ney and that
      you are not over-tired.<br/>This is not an easy letter to write. The<br/>spontaneity
      of speech - to which I am used -<br/>tries to bubble up as I write and I cannot<br/>put
      the words down fast enough.<br/>     I cannot put into words the happiness<br/>you
      gave me by being with me and<br/>I hope that I -- despite ineptness at first<br/>about
      the division of Time, and your<br/>anxiety - did please you.   I miss you<br/>but
      I shall do my best to work hard<br/>and not waste creative energy in melan-<br/>choly.  I
      am consoled by the fact that<br/>our love ensures your return.<br/><br/>     My
      lecture passed agreeably.  I<br/>ended promptly at 12, flew, and<br/>caught
      a train which will get me to Man-<br/>nerden at about 1.30. No time,<br/>alas,
      for lunch today.<br/>'
