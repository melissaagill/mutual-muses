      the proviso that they did not know their lines.
      I am working on the dressing table still-life of my painting and this afternoon hope to finish the portrait of Miss Campbell which people like and so does Tiny. This evening I am going to the Savages. I do hope that the wind drops!
      John and Georgie are coming over on Christmas Day and are very happy about. Michael[unclear] Mountais[/unclear] is coming here the week before Christmas for a few days.
      I adore you and long to see you, dearest one, my love. You seem rather remote.
      I love you, I adore you I love you
