      Nothing very interesting in my mail when I returned home. Several press-view tickets from Art News but no answer yet to my letters about a Portrait of the Artist. I shall ring up tomorrow. There is a new Mitzi Gaynor musical which I can see next Thursday morning and on Monday at 10.45 Le Plaisir, Ophuls' sequel to La Ronde, based on three de Maupassant stories. This should be useful to me, as you know.

      I have quite a busy week: one lecture every day (including Matisse- the extra one- on Friday).

      The visit to the Wallace Collection was a great success and I must say I am beginning to recover my enthusiasm for the class. They have remembered things...As you know I am talking to another Banstead group soon, one lecture on modern art. Well, the organiser or president of this group saw and liked you watercolor in the Smith Collection and, hearing of the lecture in which I showed your work, hopes I can bring something to the new group. Mr. Smith gave me the message. I shall take along cards for your exhbition, too. So I shall show Bacon, Pasmore, original Sleighs. That is, if you give me permission to do so.

      I adore your new paintings, which have all your colorism with, it seems to me, an increased fimness and clarity. Today the sun is bright. When the weather permits I hope you will be able to finish the Cart on the Shore.

      Lion has about eight letters to write today, alas. So I should stop this one to you, now. But, remember, darling I love you, I love you. Do not be sad because of my mood. I love you dearly and only you.

      Your own lion
      love you
      Lawrence

      P.S. Robert took me to the cinema yesterday evening ( we met at the Wallace Col.) Tired as I was when I got home I had to write something about it- which I enclose. It could be part of an article on say "Death In The Movies".
