      just learned that the Normid lectures have, at
      the last moment, been given to a local person.
      Your lion's luck, usually good, seems to have
      reversed itself at the moment. Poor lion - his
      mane is really very ruffled at the moment. Metty
      thinks he even seems a bit anxious, because he
      cannot live without you for long. And nor can
      Metty, she says: ah Sylvia, dearest, come soon.

      latest portrait of Dandy

      (He is read-
      ing the [unclear]Tate[/unclear]
      assistant
      keeper form
      that came
      this morning.)

      I hope Desiree was able to come today. You
      certainly seem to have a continual [unclear]haffis[/unclear] of
      young female models. Metty, [unclear]thought[/unclear] she doesn't
      say anything, is a bit concerned... Do you still
      remember her?

      Dearest one - thank you so much for all your
      letters.

      I love you, . I love you
      Lawrence
