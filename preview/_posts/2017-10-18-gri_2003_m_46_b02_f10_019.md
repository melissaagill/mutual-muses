      II

      On Friday morning I went to the New Statesman offices and saw Janet Adam Smith. She gave me the new Hogarth book (the one I bought a few days previously - you may remember it) to review and is going to send me Beckett's two volume catalogue of Hogarth's paintings when the review copies arrive. She wants me to review the two works: she stressed that this was rather in the nature of a test review to see what my work was like but that they would use me if they liked it. She thinks I might also do short reviews of art exhibitions and wants me to send her some of my notices from Art News and Review. She was charming and friendly though, you may remember, her letter was not encouraging. I am glad to have the Beckett book in any case - as you can imagine...

      Then, on the same morning, I went to the Times Literary Supplement (I was wearing my suit and duffle coat) and saw Allan Pryce-Jones. He was charming and gay - he sat on his chair behind a vast desk with his arms folded round his knees which were pulled up to his chest - and promised to send me some art of literary books to review. He seemed confident of using me as a reviewer. He said he could help with other introductions, to the Observer of Spectator, when I told him I hoped to make a living by writing.

      You are kind in your concern for me but I see from your letters that you need my concern also: with two lectures on one day and entertaining at the weekend! Do not, my rare beauty, exquisite rose, tire yourself. Rest on Tuesday as indolently as I am doing today: I don't think I shall ever do any Hogarth! Have all your meals with Tiny that day, and do not work at all. I recommend this passionately.

      The last Ranstead lecture was yesterday and they want me to go on for a third term. I agreed. They want the 19th century and to 'then come on to quite modern stuff'.
