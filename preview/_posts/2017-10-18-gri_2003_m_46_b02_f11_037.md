      Blackheath 22 xii 1949

      Dearest love -

      I imagine the country must be very pleasant at this time if the weather is any guide: [unclear]Phaebus[/unclear] seems to be giving us all Christmas presents this year.

      My only news is about the A.I.A. We are planning next year's exhibitions and there will be several shows that might be suitable for you to send in for. There is another meeting on the Friday before the Saturday on which I hope to see you - so more news then. I am having tea with Gerald Marks today, who is an important member of it.

      Oh yes - I have had another cheque from Birmingham I'm glad to say - for 3..5s.

      This morning [unclear]Yawalla[/unclear], Lionel,

      Dearest Love-

      I imagine the country must be very plea-
      sant at this time if the weather here is any
      guide.  Phaebus seems to be giving us all
      Christmas presents this year.

      My only news is about the A.I.A.
      We are planning next year's exhibitions
      and there will be several mixed shows
      that might be suitable for you to send
      in for.  There is another meeting on
      the Friday before the Saturday on which
      I hope to see you - so more news then.
      I am having tea with Gerald Marks to-
      day, who is an important member of it.

      Oh yes, I have had another cheque
      from Birmingham I'm glad to say -
      for 3..5s

      This warning Yowolla, Lionel
