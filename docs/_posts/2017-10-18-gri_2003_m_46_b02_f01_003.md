      There is no split between love and it's form.
      I have found again the Greenwood Prize address and so I will be able to submit a poem. I shall write an image a kiss, a nurse a smile... It will be much longer than any of the century  of poems for you that you have now.it will match the longer and deeper experience. My first poems for you were rather staccato  and then they became more confident.  But all of them are the size of lyrics or sonnets, as if mirroring  the nervous, broken rhthym  of our meetings, the alternation of love and solitude. But now I shall write for my lady something long, elaborate, complete. My Lady as Muse. Not a watercolour but an oil. You inspired in me the idea on our double portrait, improving it infallible with each addition. I want to produce the poetic equivalent of your picture. It's greater security  of structure than my other poems will mirror our love.
      I love you, Lawrence.

    annotation_text: There is no split between love and its form.  I have found again
      the Greenwood Prize address and so I will be able to submit a poem.  I shall
      write an image a kiss, a verse a smile...It will be much longer than any of
      the century of poems for you that you have now.  It will match the longer and
      deeper experience.  My first poems for you were rather staccato and then they
      became more confident.  But all of them are the size of lyrics or sonnets, as
      if mirroring the nervous, broken rhythm of our meetings, the alternation of
      love and solitude.  But now I shall write for my lady something long,, elaborate,
      complete.  My Lady as Muse.  Not a watercolour but an oil.  You inspired in
      me the idea of a long poem by your lengthy work on our double portrait, improving
      it infallibly with each addition.  I want to produce the poetic equivalent of
      your picture.  Its greater security of structure than my other poems will mirror
      our love.  I will write again tomorrow.  I love you, Lawrence
