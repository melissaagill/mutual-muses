      London                    [27-3-50]
      Monday
      Dearest Sylvia
      Forgive my delay, in writing, I am very sad and guilty at myself but on Sunday morning I was rather ill. Saturday evening I drank a quantity of rough cider which upset me and thoroughly incapacitated me on Sunday. Do forgive me.

      I am glad that Tiny agrees about Newcastle - I'm sure that will relieve your mind consid-erably, as it does mine for I was worried in case your conflicts were exceptionally trying, with the necessity of flat-letting, and coming to town early.
      I shall behave myself very correctly and not attempt to see you too much, so that you will not have to stay on after 8th April.
      Aren't they vile, the old ladies . at Pett, not welcoming a picture. They are, as Joyce might have said 'anticonologicunts' I am get-ting on with my review = Paul Southey was very helpful. He also helped my recovery, when he came yesterday evening.
      Thank you so muc for your letter. It was a charming one, which banished my last feeling of unhealth this morning. I love you.
