      [23-8-53] Sunday Blackheath Dearest Sylvia
      Thank you for your letter & thank you for getting it to me so quick.
      I was so pleased to hear from you so soon (Saturday evening it
      came) because I have felt very low since you went: depressed
      by day and sleepness by night. I am glad that you slept pretty
      well - I hope you may continue to do so.

      I am reassured that C's injuries are comparitively light. I
      adore your story about him in the wheel chair. I laughed
      out loud when I read it. (It still wakes me chuckle as I re-read
      it.)

      How is MM's Zulieka Dolson treatment? Have you read it -
      are you ecpected to? I hope you have time for a few conver-
      sations with him. MM makes me think of the movies & that
      reminds me I couldn't book for The General tonight so M
      & I will have to queue for 45 minutes or so to see it. I
      expect he will be willing to.
      Delighted to hear that Pett is receiving its share of rain.

      Yes, I found some useful lit. at the ICA - including a
      fascinating paper (about the size of an entire VOGUE) on
      the museum at Sao Paulo. I hope to finish the syllabar
      this morning in time for M's comments.

      CJ gave me lunch and told me about his trip. he seems
      to have worked hard tho' he neglected (according to my
      standards) the Mandrians at Otterlo. On the other hand
      he looked at Dutch architecture in some detail (he
      had some Dutch contacts who showed him around). He
      has lent me the Venetian & Van Gogh exhibition cala-
      logues which are useful to me as you know.

      Blackheath
      Sunday
      Dearest Sylvia
      Thank you for your letter and thank you for getting it to me so quick.
      I was so pleased to hear from you so soon (Saturday evening it
      came) because I have felt very low since you want:  depressed
      by day and sleepless by night.  I am glad that you slept pretty
      well--I love you may continue to do so.
      I am reassured that C's imagines are comparatively slight.  I
      adore your story about him in the wheel chair.  I laughed
      out loud when I read it.  (It still makes me chuckle as I re-read
      it.)
      How is MM's Zulieka Dolson treatment?  Have you read it.
      Are you expected to?  I hope you have time fo a few conver-
      sations with him.  MM makes me think of the movies and that
      reminds me I couldn't book for The General tonight so M
      and I will have to grew for 45 minutes or so to ssee it.  I
      expect he will be willing to.
      Delighted to hear that Pett is receiving its share of rain.
      Yes, I found some useful lit. at the ICA--includign a
      fascinating paper (about the size of an entire VOGUE) on
      the museum at Sao Paulo.  I hope to finish the syllabus
      this morning in time for M's comments.
      CJ gave me lunch and told me about his trip.  He seems
      to have worked hard tho he neglected (according to my
      standards0 the Mandrian at others.  On the other hand
      he looked at Duch architecture in some detail (he
      had some Dutch conforts who showed him round).  He
      has lent me the Venetian and Van Gogh exhibitions cata-
      logues which are useful to me as you know.
