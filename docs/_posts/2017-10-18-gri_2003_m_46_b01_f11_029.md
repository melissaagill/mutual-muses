      Passionate Pavanne
      Such music, near at hand,
      Wakes the sleeper,
      Sends the hunter for his bow,
      Ship-wrecks the cartographer.
      It is a beating heart
      Sounding in the red caves
      Of the body like a drum
      A lyre accompanies
      As when the wind
      Draws his fingers through your hair

      Pertaining to Clouds
      The clouds, victims of wind
      And of enquiring wits
      Who catch the fluent world
      With nets of transference,
      Divulge the news of love.
      For who, the lover asks,
      Could miss the heraldry
      Of images on vair?
      Scarves by the hand of Paris,
      Galleries of arms,
      Owls and cornucopias,
      And sunsets like a swan.

      Song
      I wake at seven, see
      Holly nodding in the breeze.
      You wake at eight, remark
      How still the orchard is.
      You eat white bread, I brown,
      I eat at ten, at nine
      You settle in your chair
      And look into the cup.
      At noon maybe we share
      Authentic souvenirs
      Or in the well of sleep
      Obey a single oracle.

      I love you, Lawrence
