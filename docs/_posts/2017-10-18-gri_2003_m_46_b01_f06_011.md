      heavy as smoke
      from a guilty town
      their sensual discharge

      o crimson helmet
      dark as hoarded blood
      armpits of red
      or dusty pink lips
      knots of fire
      islands of fire
      heraldic calyx

      o quim

      armadas of rose
      ardour of manes

      lamps of folded red
      secret vases
      of burning petals
      soft as armpits

      badges of soft flame
      trembling symbols
      like birds on fire
      above a globe of kisses
