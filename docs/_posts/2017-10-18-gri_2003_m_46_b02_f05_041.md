      18th May - Wednesday
      Dear love,
      I think I have all your letters now, including the one with exciting news of [unclear]another secretaire[/unclear] which sounds irresistable. We must certainly have a look at it on Friday. I feel quite stim-
      ulated at the prospect of a visit to [unclear]Cracknel's[/unclear] with you.
      Congratulations about your lecture on 'Aesthetic'. Goodness me, yes, you will have to read Goethe, and Lessing, and [unclear]Hagel[/unclear], and the German translation of Hogarth's 'Analysis', and, of course, selected works of Aristotle, Plato, Horace, and a few others. If you start reading now you may just be ready by 9th November. Don't forget a postscript about [unclear]Varrohi[/unclear] and [unclear]Licino[/unclear]. - No, seriously, I can't think there is any need to read Goethe, any more than [unclear]Ruslein[/unclear].
      Oh, what a nice thought - that your letter was written in the rose garden. I remember that you read The Listener and New Statesman to me there. I remember weeding there with you, too. I shall start on the Blackheath garden poem...
      I am glad you can put the form through the Hastings branch - that will save worry & trouble. 5 worth of [unclear]lira[/unclear] is excellent - my 2 was entirely arbitrary.
      I must get on with my work today - but I will write again very soon.
      Darling I love you

      18th May - Wednesday
      Dear love,
      I think I have all your letters now, including the one with exciting news of another secretaire which sounds irresistible. We must certainly have a look at it on Friday. I feel quite stimulated at the prospect of a visit to Cracknels with you.
      Congratulations about your lecture on 'aesthetic'. Goodness me, yes, you will have to read Goethe, and Lessing, and Megel, and the German translation of Hogarth's 'Analysis', and, of course, selected works of Aristotle, Plato, Horace, and a few others. If you start reading now you may just be ready by 9th November. Don't forget a postscript about Van Chi and Sicino. No, seriuosly, I can't think there is any need to read Goethe, any more than Ruskin.
      Oh, what a nice thought - that your letter was written in the rose garden. I remember that you read The Listener and New Statesman to me there. I remember weeding there with you, too. I shall start on the Blackheath garden soon...
      I am glad you can put the farm through the Hastings branch - that will save worry & trouble. £5 worth of lira is excellent - my £2 was entirely arbitary.
      I must get on with my work today - but I will write again very soon.
      Darling I love you
      Lawrence

      18th May - Wednesday

      Dear Lore.
      I think i have all your letters now, including the one with exciting news of araltha secretaries which sounds irresistible.  We must certainly have a look at it on Friday.  I feel quite stim-ulated at a prospect of a visit to Cardinals with you.

        Congratulations about your leding on 'Aesthelic".  Goodness me, ues, you will have to read Goethe and Lessing, and Hegel, and the German translation of Mogarths 'Aralysis", and, of course, selected works of Aristotle, Plato, Horace, and a few others.  If you start reading now, you may just be ready by 9th November.  Don't forget a postscript about Vanchi and Ficino.  - No, seriously, I cant think there is any need to read Goethe, any more than Ruslein.

        Oh, what a nice thought - that your letter was written in the rose garden.  I remember that you read The Listener and New Statesmen to me there.  I remember weeding there with you, too.  I shall start on the Blackheats garden soon ...

        I am glad you can put the form through our Hastings branch - that will save worry and trouble.  $5 worth of live is excellent.  My $2 was entirely arbitrary.

        I mist get on with my work today - but I will write again very soon.

           Darling I love you
