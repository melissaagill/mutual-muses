      To-morrow<br/>we are all going to hear Cliff-<br/>ord feature on "The economy<br/>on
      the Mind".<br/>I very much look forward<br/>to hearing more of your travels<br/>and
      especially to hearing of<br/>Norwich.<br/>I am sorry that the party<br/>on Friday
      tried you, my sweet<br/>one, I hope you are rested<br/>now. I am glad Charles<br/>took
      you out - that was<br/>pleasant of him - I hope<br/>you had a good meal! The<br/>film
      you mention was not<br/>very well reviewed.<br/>I hope Paul is well - tell<br/>me
      his news.<br/>
