      Hart is coming tomorrow so I shall only have to change the decora-
      tions once for two birds.  Robert is returning some books I lent
      him and promises to show me catalogues of some current French ex-
      hibitions.

      In the tube train yesterday I noticed a weird advertisement for
      a denture cleaner.  It is worthy of the hand of Rene Magritte him-
      self.  It is something like this, only you must add scrupulously
      naturalistic color:

      I also scribbled down a piece of
      a poem on the advertisements in
      the tube:

      Penguins with shoes, elephants
      With a trunk of fountain-pens,
      A razor-blade on a velvet cushion,
      A laughing mouth in a glass--
      Graffiti of a catacomb.
      What do you mean, we're not entombed?

      I am so glad Clifford is favorable about your Lion for it shows
      he returns the great good will and respect I have for him.

      I see in your letter you wrote it naked but for a rolled up skirt.
      Oh, I wish you were here, I wish you were.

      I love and adore you, my life, I love you.

      Hart is coming tomorrow so I shall only have to change the decora-
      tion once for two birds. Robert is returning some books I lent
      him and promises to show me catalogues of some current French ex-
      hibitions.

      In the tube train yesterday I noticed a weird advertisement for
      a denture cleaner. It is worthy of the hand of Rene Magritte him-
      self. It is something like this, only you must had scrupulously
      naturalistic color:

      I also scribbled down a piece of
      a poem on the advertisement in the tube:

      Penguins with shoes, elephants
      With a trunk of fountain-pens,
      A razor-blade on a velvet cushion,
      A laughing mouth in a glass -
      Graffiti of a catacomb
      What do you mean, we're not entombed?

      I am so glad Clifford is favorable about your Lion for it shows
      he returns the great good will and respect I have for him.

      I see in your letter you wrote it naked but for a rolled up skirt.
      Oh, I wish you were here, I wish you were.

      I love you and adore you, my life, I love you
      Lawrence

      P. S. Love to Tiger and Tiny.
