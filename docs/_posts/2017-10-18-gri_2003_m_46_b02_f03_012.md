      19th March 1949 Harpenden

      Dearest Sylvia,

      I have just had a lunch-time walk in the pleasant landscape outside the village, over towards [unclear]Redbowine[/unclear]. It is a fresch, crisp, bright day and I enjoyed it very much though I couldn't help wishing that you were there with your watercolours. Then the experience would have been preserved...

      I enclose a cutting from the Harpenden FREE PRESS and I need not tell you how annoyed I am on behalf of us both about the captions. The reporter had no right to assume anything of the kind and Dandylion's tail is bristling. I have ordered this and the other photograph but they won't be ready for a week.

      Yesterday I had about 80 school boys but today is quiet again. I thought there would be a rush and left [unclear][/unclear] at the hotel and I am regretting this waste of time. Even Saturday the people seem to be rather indifferent to the exhibition though the publicity is so bad many don't know about it. Sherwood was efficient in comparison with this!

      I hope that the situation is not too frightening though I can guess at your grief and feel something of your terrible perplexity. But on the other hand the lover in me begs you to remember his love as he remembers yours: although it is that which makes the tension so great it is that also which gives a reason to the conflict. I hope that thought of my love will give some ease and consolation.

      Dearest Sylvia,
      I have just had a lunch-time walk in the pleasant
      landscape outside the village, over towards Red-
      bourne.  It is a fresh, crisp, bright day and I en-
      joyed it very much though I couldn't help wish-
      ing that you were there with your watercolours.
      Then the experience would hav been preserved...

      I enclose a cutting from the [unclear] Harpenden [/unclear] FREE PRESS
      and I need not tell you how annoyed I am on behalf
      of us both about the caption.  The reporter had no
      right to assume anything of the kind and Dandylion's
      tail is bristling.  I have ordered this and the other
      [unclear] photograph [/unclear] but they won't be ready for a week.

      Yesterday I had about 80 school boys but today is
      quiet again.  I thought there would be a rush and
      left Mogarth at the hotel and I am regretting this
      waste of time.  Even Saturday the people seem to
      be rather indifferent to the exhibition though the
      publicity is so bad many don't know about it.
      Sherwood was efficient in comparision with this!

      I hope the situation is not too frightening
      though I can guess at your grief and feel something of your terrible perplexity.  But on the other hand
      the lover in me begs you to remember his love as he re-
      members yours: although it is that wich makes
      the tension so great it is that also which gives a
      reason to the conflict.  I hope that thought of my
      love will give some ease and consolation.

      I hope that the situation is not too frightening though I can guess at your grief and feel something of your terrible perplexity.  But on the other hand the lover in me begs you to remember his love as he remembers yours: although it is that which makes the tension so great it is that also which gives a reason to the conflict.  I hope that thought of my love will give some [unclear]ease[/unclear] and [unclear]comolation[/unclear].
