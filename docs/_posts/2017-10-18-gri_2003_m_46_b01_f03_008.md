      Thank you for your architecture papers.  They are admirable.  I am writing, even now ([unclear]ine[/unclear]-writing I should say) your essay on hammer-[unclear]trusses[/unclear] and collar-tie roofs...Also I've done one one on [unclear]town[/unclear] planning and one on the [unclear]Migs-Law[/unclear]-Flat roofs problem.  Original work, too, you will notice.
           On the 18th May I am giving a lecture on Zurbaran and el Greco at the N.G. [unclear]a solid Gibson[/unclear] will listen to see if I'm fit to lecture there as a sort of sub-Clare.  15 s. a time.  15 s!
           I [unclear]am going[/unclear] and will write again tomorrow.

I am writing, even now, (re-writing I should say) your essay on [unclear] hammer-trusses[unclear] and [unclear]collars[unclear] - the roofs.... Also I've done one on town planning and one on the [unclear]pligs-low-flat[unclear] roofs problem.  Original work, too you will notice.
      On the 18th May I am giving a lecture on Zurbaran and el Greco at the N. G. a [unclear]merit[unclear] [unclear]Gilson[unclear] will listen to see if I'm yet to lecture there as a sort of sub-[unclear]Clare[unclear]. 15s a time. 15s!
      I love you and will write again tomorrow
