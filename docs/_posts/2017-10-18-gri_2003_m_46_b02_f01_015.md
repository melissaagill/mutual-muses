      Dearest, dearest Sylvia,

      Thank you for your letter which made me happy this morning. Your feelings in the train were rather mine too and the next week is for me a blank, tense interim. I hope you have thought over the Blackheath room described in my letter and will accept it till mid-March. I hope you will be able to talk to Michael without too much distress. I know you will not delay this time, my dearest, and I promise you love, happiness, artistic creation. Alas, that you are tired. I hope you are fit again now. I am alright.

      I have a lecture at the N.G. Thursday morning and I think it is this Friday that I go to a village near Tunbridge Wells for Skipp to talk about French drawings. Today I have some reviews to do: the D.B.Wyndham Lewis book is really quite good. I think you would like some of the Pompadour tributes. My course at Banstead will start on the 31st. It sounds easy and no preparation is really needed. Minimum rate is 25s. but I may get a little more. Anyway it is that much more a week so useful. I act for you, darling, in every poem, firstly in every poem, and in every article and lecture too.

      What magnificent eyes you have - eloquent and subtle. I keep thinking of you in your hood, the blue lining [unclear]under the fur edge[/unclear] glimpsed round your face [unclear]under the fur edge[/unclear] - how accomplished and easy you looked. And in your blue dress - at dinner and by the great fire at the Star and Garter - well, you know how you ravish me in that. (I hope your shoes are comfortable.)

      The Wright and Lambert photographs have come and the one for us of Dovedale is superb. Robert Hart is going to lend me Antal's Florentine book so that will be interesting to us both I think.

      You asked for news of my poems but pleasantly our letters crossed so you have most of the news already. Good news indeed about the Greenwood prize. The riming poem you alone have I'm afraid in your notebook but I will decipher it if you will bring that small note-book when you come.

      Lunch is nearly ready so I must close this letter now.

      Look after yourself my rose, sleep well, do not worry  too much if you can help it, and remember our love can overcome guilt.

      I love you, I love you,
      I am so happy you have enjoyed re-reading my poems. I will write again quickly - I love you

      Dearest, dearest Sylvia,

      Thank you for your letter which made me happy this morning. Your feelings in the train were rather mine too and the next week is for me a blank, tense interim. I hope you have thought over the Blackheath room described in my letter and will accept it till mid-March. I hope you will be able to talk to Michael without too much distress. I know you will not delay this time, my dearest, and I promise you love, happiness, artistic creation. Alas, that you are tired. I hope you are fit again now. I am alright.

      I have a lecture at the N.G. Thursday morning and I think it is this Friday that I go to a village near Tunbridge Wells for Skipp to talk about French drawings. Today I have some reviews to do: the D.B. Wyndham Lewis book is really quite good. I think you would like some of the Pompadour tributes. My course at Banstead will start on the 31st. It sounds easy and no preparation is really needed. Minimum ate is 25s. but I may get a little more. Anyway it is that much more a week so useful. I act for you, darling, in every poem, firstly in every poem, and in every article and lecture too.

      What magnificent eyes you have - eloquent and subtle. I keep thinking of you in your hood, the blue lining under the fur edge glimpsed round your face - how accomplished and easy you looked. And in your blue dress -  at dinner and by the great fire at the Star and Garter - well, you know how you ravish me in that. (I hope your shoes are comfortable.)

      The Wright and Lambert photographs have come and the one for us of Dovedale is superb. Robert Hart is going to lend me Antal's Florentine book so that will be interesting to us both I think.

      You asked for news of my poems but pleasantly our letters crossed so you have most of the news already. Good news indeed about the Greenwood prize. The riming poem you alone have I'm afraid in your notebook but I will decipher it if you will bring that small notebook when you come.

      Lunch is nearly ready so I must close this letter now.

      Look after yourself my rose, sleep well, do not worry too much if you can help it, and remember our love can overcome guilt.

      I love you, I love you,

      18th January 1949

      11 Mansel Road  Wimbledon

      Dearest, dearest Sylvia,

      Thank you for your letter which made me happy this morning. Your feelings in the train were rather mine too and the next week is for me a blank, tense interim. I hope you have thought over the Blackheath room described in my letter and will accept it till mid-March. I hope you will be able to talk to Michael without too much distress. I know you will not delay this time, my dearest, and I promise you love, happiness, artistic creation. Alas, that you are tired. I hope you are fit again now. I am alright.

      I have a lecture at the N.G. Thursday morning and I think it is this Friday that I go to a village near Tunbridge Wells for Skipp to talk about French drawings. Today I have some reviews to do: the D.B. Wyndham Lewis book is really quite good. I think you would like some of the Pompadour tributes. My course at Banstead will start on the 21st. It sounds easy and no preparation is really needed. Minimum rate is 25s. but I may get a little more. Anyway it is that much more a week so useful. I act for you, darling, in every poem, firstly in every poem, and in every article and lecture too.

      What magnificent eyes you have - eloquent and subtle. I keep thinking of you in your hood, the blue lining under the fur edge glimpsed round your face - how accomplished and easy you looked. And in your blue dress - at dinner and by the great fire at the Star and Garter - well, you know how you ravish me in that. (I hope your shoes are comfortable.)

      The Wright and Lambert photographs have come and the one for us of Dovedale is superb. Robert Hart is going to lend me Antal's Florentine book so that will be interesting to us both I think.

      You asked for news of my poems but pleasantly our letters crossed so you have most of the news already. Good news in-deed about the Greenwood prize. The riming poem you alone have I'm afraid in your notebook but I will decipher it if you will bring that small notebook when you come.

      Lunch is nearly ready so I must close this letter now.

      Look after yourself my rose, sleep well, do not worry too much if you can help it, and remember our love can overcome guilt.

      I love you, I love you,
      I am so happy you have enjoyed re-reading my poems. I will write again quickly - I love you
      Lawrence

    clean_transcription: '18th January 1949  11 Mansel Road Wimbledon<br/><br/>Dearest,
      dearest Sylvia,<br/><br/>  Thank you for your letter which made me happy this
      morning.  Your feelings in the train were rather mine too and the next week
      for me is a blank, tense interim.  I hope you have thought over the Blackheath
      room described in my letter and will accept it till mid-March.  I hope you will
      be able to talk to Michael without too much distress.  I know you will not delay
      this time, my dearest, and I promise you love, happiness, artistic creation.  Alas,
      that you are tired.  I hope you are fit again now.  I am alright.<br/><br/>I
      have a lecture at the N.G.  Thursday morning and I think it is this Friday that
      I go to a village near Tunbridge Wells for Skipp to talk about French drawings.  Today
      I have some reviews to do:  the D.B. Wyndham lewis book is really quite good.  I
      think you would like some of the Pompadour tributes.  My course at Banstead
      will start on the 31st.  It sounds easy and no preparation is really needed.  Minimum
      rate is 25s.  but I may get a little more.  Anyway it is that much more a week
      so useful.  I act for you, darling, in every poem, firstly in every poem, and
      in every article and lecture too.<br/><br/>What a magnificent eyes you have
      - eloquent and subtle.<br/>I keep thinking of you in your hood, the blue lining
      glimpsed round your face under the fur edge - how accomplished and easy you
      looked.  And in your blue dress - at dinner and by the great fire at the star
      and garter - well, you know how you ravish me in that.  (I hope your shoes are
      comfortable.)<br/><br/>The wright and Lambert photographers have come and the
      one for us of dovedale is superb.  Robert hart is going to lend me Antal''s
      Florentine book so that will be interesting to us both I think.<br/><br/>You
      asked for news of my poems but pleasantly our letters crossed so you have most
      of the news already.  Good news indeed about the greenwood prize.  The riming
      poem you alone have I''m afraid in your notebook but I will decipher it if you
      will bring that small nore-book when you come.  <br/><br/>Lunch is nearly ready
      so I must close this letter now.<br/><br/>Look after yourself my rose, sleep
      well, do not worry too much if you can help it, and remember our love can overcome
      guilt.  <br/><br/>I love you, I love you,<br/><br/>Im so happy you have enjoyed
      re-reading my poems<br/>I will write again quickly - I love you lawrence<br/><br/>'
