        I am so glad to hear that Tiny is showing signs of working on her favorite subject.  A book is a splendid idea - and perhaps it will fire Clifford in turn.  Tell her I hope she finds time to start work on it soon.
        It is good news about Jane, too.  I hope things will be easier for her now.
        A few minutes are let before I go to the Library and get the Barber Institute address.  That is why I have time to add this before racing to the post at four o'clock.
        What about your painting?  Have you had time to do anymore to your laughing self-portrait or to the landscape from your window?  Send me what news you have, dearest.
        I love you so much and I cannot think of you without a tremor of delight.
        I am more attached than ever to my most recent owl.  He is charming and friendly.  Dandylion and he get on very well.
        I love you, Lawrence

      I am so glad to hear that Tiny is showing signs of working on her favorite subject.  A book is a splendid idea â€” and perhaps it will fire Clifford in turn.  Tell her I hope she finds time to start work on it soon.

      It is good news about Jane, too.  I hope things will be easier for her now.

      A few minutes are left before I go to the Library and get the Barber Institute address.  That is why I have time to add this before racing to the post at four o'clock.

      What about your painting?  Have you had time to do anymore to your laughing selfportrait or to the landscape from your window?  Send me what news you have, dearest.

      I love you so much and I cannot think of you without a tremour of delight.

      I am more attached than ever to my most recent owl.  He is charming and friendly.  Dandylion and he get on very well.

                                       I love you
