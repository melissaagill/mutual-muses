      Jane rang me Friday night - as I told you - but she has not rung back as she said she would.

      Today I have written a couple of articles for Art Review, the paper I mentioned in my last letter. They will bring us about 5 guineas and on Saturday I got a £5 cheque from the N.G. Also the Observer will pay me some money and there will be more to come from Art Review. Oh dear, this sounds like Trollop's autobiography - I'm sorry.

      Did you hear the critics today? Dilys Powell, Summerson, and C-T were in it. C-T's voice reminded me very strongly of the Courtauld and our outrageous behavior. Oh darling I love you.

      When you tell Michael I expect he will resist very much. I hope - though these words are inadequate - that it will not be too agonising. Believe me I am unhappy at your grief.

      I love you, I love you,

    clean_transcription: June rang me Friday night - as I told you - but she has not
      rung back as she said she would.<br/>Today I have written a couple of articles
      for Art Review, the paper I mentioned in my last letter.  They will bring us
      about 5 guineas and on Saturday I got a [pound]5 cheque from the N.G.  Also
      the Observer will pay me some money and there will be more to come from Art
      Review.  Oh dear, this sounds like Trollop's autobiography - I'm sorry.<br/>Did
      you hear the critics today?  Dilys Powell, Summerson, and C-T were in it.  C-T's
      voice reminded me very strongly of the Courtauld and our outrageous behavior.   Oh
      darling I love you.<br/>When you tell Michael I expect he will resist very much.  I
      hope - though these words are inadequate - that it will not be too agonizing.  Believe
      me I am unhappy at your grief.<br/>I love, I love you Lawrence<br/>Dandylion
