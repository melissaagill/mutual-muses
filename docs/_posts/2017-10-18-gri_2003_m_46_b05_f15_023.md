      corrections. I think it is an interesting
      one - but I shall 'rest' coutre-jour
      things for a bit as they are such hard
      work! I hope to start on the
      still-life with Suderland jusgs to-mor-
      row. That will take some time I think
      as Clifford is nearly always working
      in the library.
      I will write again - I must do
      as much painting as I can before
      going to the post.
      I am longing to do a portrait of
      my Lion -
      I love you
