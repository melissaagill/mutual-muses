      piece with the blue<br/>vase some of the pink chair<br/>and the  being in the
      <br/>background - I am racing<br/>to finish it as the flowers<br/>started dying
      directly I<br/>got them home.<br/>Thank you so much for <br/>the delightful
      poem - oh!<br/>my Apollo - how should I<br/>pine without you; I adore<br/>you.<br/>Thank
      you also for the<br/>Folk Cubomania! It is all<br/>I can do not to cut it<br/>out
      - for the lions! - aren't<br/>they sweet.<br/>I must go back to my<br/>flowers
      before my  comes<br/>I love you Sylvia<br/>
