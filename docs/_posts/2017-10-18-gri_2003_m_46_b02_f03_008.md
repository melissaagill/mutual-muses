      Time, among his mortal cliches,
      The rakish angle of a scythe,
      And a winged hourglass,
      Running to zero in it's flight,
      Has a rival in my Love:

      She is the challenger of Time,
      The double dealer of his minutes,
      The mistress of his days and nights,
      For she- not he - computes the time
      of day and night, of love and sleep.

      You invite me to Pelt if war starts. Are rumours of war sufficient? Dandylion has his time-table in his hand, Yawalla Hood is staggering under the weight of a trunk, and Lionel that is tying his bow for the journey. I imagine the inhabitants of the rectory have a Vlaminck-black view of events.

      I love you - Lawrence

      Has a [unclear]rival[/unclear]in my love:

      She is the challenger of Time,
      The double - dealer of his minutes,
      The mistress of his days and nights,
      For she - not he - computes the time
      of day and night, of love and sleep.

      You invite me to [unclear]Pett[/unclear] if war [unclear]starts[/unclear]. Are rumours of war sufficient?  Dandylion has his time-table in his hand, [unclear]Yawalla[/unclear] Hood is staggering under the weight of a trunk, and [unclear]lionel[/unclear][unclear]that[/unclear] is tying his bow for the journey.  I imagine the inhabitants of the Rectory have a Vlaminck - bleak view of events.

      I love you
      Lawrence
