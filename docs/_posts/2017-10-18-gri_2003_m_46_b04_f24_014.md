      the letter!
      Thank you so much for the
      cards. Amy sends her her love
      and Thanks very much - Clifford
      is going to read us your Bosch
      article this evening - perhaps
      you don't know that it's
      in this week. M. thinks you
      were much too kind to Dali!
      Thank you for the lipstick,
      and the cheque - it is most
      generous, my love - but I
      fear that you can't afford it.
      Lionel's card is a delight and
      was much admired. So were
      Dandy's Christmas portraits.
      I have been very rushed please
      forgive my not having written
      before. I will write at length
      this evening.
      I hope your lecture went
      well yesterday.
      I love you I love you
      Sylvia

      the letter!
      Thank you so much for the
      cards. Tiny sends her love
      and thanks very much - Clifford
      is going to read us your Bosch
      article this evening - perhaps
      you don't know that it's
      in this week. M. thinks you
      were much too kind to Dali!
      Thank you for the lipstick,
      and the cheque - it is most
      generous, my love - but I
      fear that you can't afford it.
      Lionel's card is a delight and
      was much admired. So were
      Dandy's Christmas portraits.
      I have been very rushed please
      forgive my not having written
      before. I will write at length
      this evening.
      I hope your lecture went
      well yesterday.
      I love you I love you.
      Sylvia
