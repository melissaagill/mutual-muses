      [28-7-53] Sunday Dearest Sylvia
      Thank you for your letter from Hasting beach.
      I have vivid pictures of you writing it:
      in your new sun-hat possibly?

      I am sorry that the murals are all for
      art students; or, are they mainly for
      art students? Why don't you ring
      up or write lines, anyway? It could
      do no harm: on the contrary, it
      could do good.

      Saturday would really be best if
      you are coming here at the weekend.
      Friday I shall be fantically busy
      at the National Gallery all day (often
      I have delivered your water colours).
      I could meet you any time on Satur-
      day.

      I have just this morning finished The
      Travel Agent. Did I tell you that
      Carter wants to get on with the TV

      [28-7-53]
      Sunday
      Dearest Sylvia
      Thank you for your letter from Hasting Wood.
      I have a vivid picture of you writing it:
      in your new sun hat possibly?
      I am sorry that the murals are all for
      art students; or, are they mainly for
      art students?  Why don't you ring
      up or write lines, anyway?  It could
      do no harm:  on the contrary, it
      could do good.
      Saturday would really be best if
      you are coming here at the weekend.
      Friday I shall be frantically busy
      at the National Gallery all day (after
      I have delivered your water colors).
      I could meet you any time on Satur-
      day.
      I have just this minute finished The
      Travel Agent.  Did I tell you that
      Carter wants to get on with the TV
