      cross train if he is going later and the
      Victoria train--but perhaps I won't
      for you will only just have time to catch
      the 12:30 bus if you came by the
      10:25 and I don't want to stay
      so long in Hastings or you won't get
      any lunch!
      I haven't heard from Chase--I
      wonder if you would mind giving him
      a ring I wrote on Friday last
      telling him times of trains etc.
      Wes:  4299.  If you could find out
      if he is coin on Friday or Saturday.
      If the letter Clifford will din with
      us on Friday!
      I must go off now to
      Miss Campbell--am longing to see you.
      I adore you--good luck
      for Thursday--it should be most
      interesting.
      I love you.
