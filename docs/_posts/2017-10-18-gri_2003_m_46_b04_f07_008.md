      Nostalgia's blade cuts the cord
      of the hypertrophied candelabra.
      No phantasy remains to hide
      The city where I moon and remember
      The country's simple sun, and Sylvia.

        As a particular concessions to cat's taste it even
      rhymes though how to tell person will feel about candel
      abra & Sylvia I am not sure.
         The Woods will be back soon I expect. I am glad
      that Desiree came to tea. Pleasant for you and
      invaluable for her.
         The flowers are doing well. The geranium is
      flourishing and the [unclear]others[/unclear], tho' a little exhausted
      on Monday, have revived as a result of Dandy's
      water.
         I think that I may not be able to meet the
      Woods before, possibly, Wednesday. That would
      still give a little while before [unclear]Wlacho's[/unclear] arrival.
      Or it might be best for me to come on Sunday but leave
      early. As Michael presumably will be there
      do you think that would matter? The possible
      dates are 15th-19th or 18th-22nd. I will
      write tomorrow more definitely. It all de-
      pends on Athene's printer.
         I love you, I adore you.
