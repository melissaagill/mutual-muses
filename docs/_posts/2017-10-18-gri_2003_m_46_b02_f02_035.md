    clean_transcription: ing for a show.  I don't think you should <br/>except to
      succeed because Syrton has <br/>and you are better than him.  Ayrton's success
      is due to a corruption of taste <br/>whereas your success is due will depend
      on an <br/>excellence of taste.  I imagine that <br/>you will have different
      patrons.  You will <br/>succeed, not because of another painter's <br/>demerits,
      but on your own great merits.<br/>I saw Skipp yesterday--staying <br/>with him
