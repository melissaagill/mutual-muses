      Really I think there are as many American travellers as English & French put together but happily hardly any Canadians - Hetty & I have identified two as positively Canadian.  Some of the English that are travelling are really shameful - would not look out of place visiting an Arts Council provincial exhibition.  I feel rising in me, counter to the mythological connotations of travel which I always feel with pleasure, strong feelings of social caricature.  3 young men talking for nearly an hour about English football teams, their chances, the weather & their grounds, &c.  And so the landscapes shaped by le Notre come nearer.

      I am not definitely writing a Traveller's Alphabet -  not at all like the unfinished Martyr's one.

      It is curious to anyone except you or me, that though I am now in a French setting I keep thinking, constantly, of English views - of Pett landscapes & the paintings you are making of them.  The Louvre awaits me but what I most want news of is your paintings.  Oh my superb painter - I love you.  I had a last look at your pictures this morning & they sent me off full of visionary colours & images.

      The train lurches.  We are off.  Again, my dearest beauty, Minerva - rose, I love you , I love you
