      Blackheath          26 1 1950
      Dearest Sylvia
      You say my letters are not sufficiently 'newsy' - I'm so sorry. I will correct the balance in this letter. Your own letters; on the other hand, are more 'newsy' than I like.
      I) I gave John the Dutch painters, leaving them with him. He is leaving the Arts council to work - in some administrative position- in a factory near his home. He seems pleased- more fortune in it, he claims. Skegness is cancelled - because the people there cannot now afford it.
      II) The [unclear]Coushot[/unclear] tickets are for Friday, 10th January.
      III) Yes, I have been creaming my face, thank you for remembering
      IV) Yes, I have read Kimball's Creation of the Rococo: it does not deal with pictorial art but in its way it is exhaustive.
      V) Paul's boots are like this: an exaggerated version of my Simpson's shoes which are longer than is customary.
      VI) Delighted - but not surprised - to hear about your lecture's success
      VII) We shall be in town on Tuesday 7th in the afternoon for my NG lecture at 2.30. Again Wednesday 8th for Mrs Toft. Again Friday 10th for the R.A> lectures at 5p.m. Then Wednesday 15th for Banstead - but not I hope any other times. Can you see the people at the [unclear]seat[/unclear]if see them you must, then.
      VIII) Some more [unclear]Ewanee[/unclear] Reviews have come - with another article about fiction of Caroline Gardon
      IX) The Impressionist lecture was successful, I think: I made up with Rewald's book for gaps in the slides. long discussion. They all adore Revais & mourn anew for Camille. Only 9 people, however. Mrs Smith will have to fix the negative
