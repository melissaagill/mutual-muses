      Dearest Sylvia
      How did your lecture go? I thought of you as I chatted on about
      Turner. Details & brush strokes reminded me of china marks: a
      man's bald head looked like a pot. My thoughts turned constantly to you
      I'm afraid that it must have been a tiring day for you with lunch
      beforehand & the long journey. I do hope you slept well after it.
      Nothing is more difficult than WI lectures. I have not given
      a satisfactory one yet I must admit. They are proverbially
      'sticky' as audiences go.
      The ICA evening was as dull to be in as it is to witness.
      Herbert Read was in the audience & told me confidentially
      afterwards that mine was the only serious contribution. He
      also said he agreed with what I said about BH's recent
      work tho' he had not written so in his book for diplomatic -
      social reasons. I was awfully pleased by this as you can
      imagine. i based myself on BH's statements about her
      own work. Nobody else did. I seem to have born a
      major part in the discussion as I alone supported BH with
      some warmth. It kept coming back to me. ( Nice food, wine,
      and drinks supplied by the ICA.)
      Anthony Hill was there. Also I met William Scott.
      I am on my way to the V & A for Banstead slides. 2 lec-
      tures tomorrow + tea with [unclear]Parmore[/unclear]. I lecture each on
      Friday & Saturday.
      I love you so much. It is nearing Saturday-
      adore you
      Lawrence

      Dearest Sylvia,
      How did your lecture go? I thought of you as I chattered on about
      Turner. Details of brush strokes reminded me of China works: a
      man's bald bead looked like a pot. My thoughts turned constantly to you
      I'm afraid that it must have been a tiring day for you with lunch
      beforehand the long journey. I do hope you slept well after it.
      Nothing is more difficult than WI lectures. I have not given
      a satisfactory one yet I must admit. They are proverbially
      'sticky' as audiences go.
      The ICA evening was as dull to be in as it is to witness. Herbert Read was in the audience & told me confidentially
      afterwards that mine was the only serious contribution. He
      also said he agreed with what I said about BH's recent
      work tho' he had not written so in his book for diplomatic-
      social reasons. I was awfully pleased in this as you can
      imagine. I based myself on BH's statements about her
      own work. Nobody else did. I seem to have born a
      major part in the discussion as I alone supported BH with
      some warmth. It kept coming back to me. (Nice food, wine,
      and drinks supplied at the ICA.)
      Anthony Mill was there. Also I met William Scott.
      I am on my way to the V & A for Barnstead slides. 2 lec-
      tures tomorrow + tea with Parmore. I lecture each on
      Friday & Saturday.
      I love you so much. It is nearing Saturday.
      I adore you
      Lawrence

      How did your lecture go? I thought of you as I chattered on about

      beforehand & the long journey. I do hope you slept well after it.
      Nothing is more difficult than W I lectrues. I have not given
      a satisfactory one yet I must admit. They are proverbially

      Herbert Read was in the audience & told me confidentally

      Friday & Saturday.
      I love you so much. It is nearing Saturday -
