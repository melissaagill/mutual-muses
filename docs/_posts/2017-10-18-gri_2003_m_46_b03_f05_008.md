      Dearest Sylvia

      Thank you for this morning's letter. I shall, of course, meet the bus on Thursday afternoon at [unclear][/unclear] so do not worry on that point.

      Your invitation to Pelt, on your return, is not practicable unfortunately so I must for the present refuse.

      I'm afraid this must be a rather short letter but you will understand that.

      My Kandinsky review is finished - so, as far as compilation is concerned, is the arts council exhibition (I have obtained the last picture this afternoon) but there are still some problems of display to cope with which we might discuss profitably when you come. I have some more Hogarth photographs also.

      I adore you. Thoughts of you expand in my mind, from herds, to leaves, to birds, that fly from tree to tree igniting with ravishing memories each tree where they pause, before flying on accompanied by more birds, more memories of your beautiful pores, your lovely body, my beautiful cat of the [unclear][/unclear] weather, [unclear][/unclear], love, muse.

      I adore you

      Lawrence

      Thank you for this morning's letter. I shall, of course, meet the 'bus on Thursday afternoon at Lewisham so do not worry on that point.

      Your invitation to [unclear]Pett[/unclear], on your return is not practicable unfortunately so I must for the present refuse.

      I'm afraid this must be a rather short letter but you will understand that.

      My Kandinsky review is finished - so, as far as compilation is concerned, is the only council exhibition (I have obtained the last picture this afternoon) but there are still some problems of display to cope with which we might discuss profitably when you come. I have some more Hogarth photographs also.

      I adore you. Thoughts of you expand in my mind, from buds, to leaves, to birds, that fly from tree to tree igniting into vanishing memories each tree where they pause, before flying on accompanied by more birds, more memories of you, beautiful poses, your lovely body, my beautiful cat of the hot weather, pose, love, muse.

      Dearest Sylvia
      Thank you for this morning's letter. I shall, of course, meet the bus on Thursday afternoon at Lewiston so do not worry on that point. Your invitation to Pett, on your return, is not [unclear]predictable[/unclear] unfortunately so I must for the present refuse.
      I'm afraid this must be a rather short letter but you will understand that.
      My Kandinsky review is finished - so, as far as compilation is concerned, is the arts council ex-
      hibition ( I have obtained the last picture this afternoon) but there are still some problems of dis-
      play to cope with which we might discuss profit-
      ably when you come. I have some more Hogarth photographs also.
      I adore you. Thoughts of you expand in my mind, from buds, to leaves, to bids, that fly from tree to tree igniting with ravishing memories each tree where they pause, before flying on accompanied by more birds, more memories of you, beautiful [unclear][/unclear], your lovely body, my beautiful cat of the [unclear][/unclear], love, muse.
      I adore you
      Lawrence
