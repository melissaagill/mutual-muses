      Polydor, or The Poet's Century

      In a corridor of poets
      Who stand like statues at the doors of years
      The first person passes, like a pen writing,
      Puzzling on the extent of hidden suites.

      A poet holds the handle of the door
      In his mouth and mumbles to the first person:
      I remember my name but not who I am.
      I am the first person, to be so fated.

      Another poet draws bottles on a door
      And writes their names in tung-tung underneath:
      The number of his fingers is pre-destined
      Though not the filling of calligraphic jars.

      The third poet is posting a telegram
      Through a letter box fringed with hair:
      Such slots do not bewilder statuesque poets
      So much as the immobility of doors.

      Who is the poet with keyholes for eyes?
      Is he blinded by keys or can he see both ways?
      Can he see what the servant saw and Katy did,
      Voluptuous as the hands on an Edwardian clock?

      Is the clue to the occupant a lion
      In the wake of whose leap the curtains sway,
      The water of the upset vase still falling:
      The poet in the fifth door guesses so.

      A poet taps the sill of melancholy,
      His poems an electric light that shows
      Arabian girls asleep behind the door
      Among chaotic symbols of their blood.
