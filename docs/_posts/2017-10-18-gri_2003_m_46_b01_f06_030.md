      CHISWICH HOUSE RE-VISITED

      In the Italian garden
      The whitish urns and terms
      Define a crescent's curve
      Where double flower beds cross the lawn
      Like two great letters S.

      Signatures in the finest hand,
      copper-plate S, curlicue,
      Filled in with flowers,
      Gules in the capitals
      That I marvel at, desire.

      A bearded term and one be-laurelled
      Forever challenge each.
      Pinked by the sun one seems to boast.
      (The shadowed one tomorrow wins.)
      Delicate mosses touch both heads.

      In seraphic rows the flowers:
      Static as ideas of order,
      Geometry of spheres,
      Stanzas in the Earl's praise,
      Heraldic as the stars.

      Beyond the formal border, trees
      Assemble varied green designs
      That spring and droop and slant
      In one large shaggy mass.
      (A pigeon waddles on the grass.)
