      Dearest Lawrence
      Thank you for your letter and delightfully evocative drawing of the S.E.A. committee _ what did they think of my [unclear][/unclear] work?
      I have been working on the pictures of the "Golden Amulet" - I have done the figures - beginning at the back! I think it is going nicely. I went to see Mrs. Bauser this morning and have borrowed some additional photographs which will prove very helpful I think. She told me all about the next production - she wants me to take a small part - I think I shall - the rehearsals won't begin until August - I think I should very much enjoy that. I am very glad you will get

      Dearest Lawrence,
      Thank you for your letter and
      delightfully evocative drawing of
      the SEA Committee.  What did
      they think of my Lion's work?
      I have been working on the pictures
      of the "Golden Amulet".  I have
      done the background and am working
      on the figures--beginning at the
      back!  I think it is going nicely.
      I went to see Mrs. Banger this
      morning and have borrowed some
      additional photographs which
      will prove very helpful I think.
      She told me all about the next
      production--she wants me to
      take a small past.  I think
      I shall--the rehearsals won't
      begin until August.  I think
      I should very much enjoy that.
      I am very glad you will get

    clean_transcription: Pett 16.6.52<br/>Dearest Lawrence<br/>Thank you for your
      letter and<br/>delightfully evocative drawing of<br/>the S.E.A committee - what
      did<br/>they think of my Lion's work?<br/>I have been working on the picture<br/>of
      the "Golden Amulet" - I have<br/>done the background and am working<br/>on the
      figures - beginning at the<br/>back! I think it is going nicely<br/>I went to
      see Mrs Banger this<br/>morning and have borrowed some<br/>additional photographs
      which<br/>will prove very helpful I think.<br/>She told me all about the next<br/>production
      - she wants me to<br/>take a small part - I think<br/>I shall - the rehearsals
      won't<br/>begin until August - I think<br/>I should very much enjoy that.<br/>I
      am very glad you will get
