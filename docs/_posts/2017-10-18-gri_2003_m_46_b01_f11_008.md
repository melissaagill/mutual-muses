      5th December 1948

      Dearest Sylvia,

      Thank you darling for a charming letter which turned my head with pleasure. I am happy that you liked our poems and chapter. Tho think about you is to think poetically. Here are a pair of poems for you, dearest Sylvia. The second one takes a conceit of Donne's (Busie olde foole, Unrulie Sunner) and turns it round.

      Nocturne

      Pale blue stars ambush my sight:
      Victorious ephemera
      Of shooting stars traverse
      The sky between our houses
      On this cold winter night.

      Oh for our hands to witness
      The testament of love
      With you on such a night
      That I may be at last
      Love's willing Sisyphus.

      Aubade

      Apollo makes the sleepy lovers
       Each tousled nude complains
      At the intruding light, and of the need
      To work the orchard or the fields
      And leave from love for daylight hours.
