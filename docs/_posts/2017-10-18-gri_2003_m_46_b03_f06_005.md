      BERTHE MORISOT AS A SYMBOLIST
         The exibition of Berthe Morisot's work organized by the Arts Council prompted, of course, the usual observations on art and femininity.  Eric Newton, speaking for many as usual, wrote in 'The Listener':  'though one could easily deduce her sex without looking at the signature on her pictures, that does not make her a less competent painter though it does make her a less whole-hearted impressionist'.   In fact the non-impressionist undercurrent derives, not from her sex but from her relationship with the contemporary Symbolist movement.  She was influenced by the symbolist Gauguin in the early 1890's ('Peasant Girl lying Down' , for example)  but a more intimate link is with Mallarme' who christ-ened one of Berthe Morisot's garden conversations 'le Fable', a title which accents the allusive quality of her art.
         'Boats Under Construction' (exhibited at the second Impression-ist exhibition) is a painterly notation of things seen.  The por-trait of her husband 'Eugene Manet looking out at the Sea from a window, Isle of Wight' (1875) is also a pure impressionist work.  If we compare the tender but scupturesque 'Young Woman in a Ball Dress' (1879-80) with 'Young Woman on a Sofa' symbolist char- acteristics in the latter become clear:  The empty spaces around the single figure are curiously evocative and the flowers and fan are favorite images of Mallarme'.  The superb 'Child with her Doll' (1884) reveals strong symbolist attachments with it's floating forms disintegrating in a tangible avalanche of light.    Colour and light are freed from objective functions in Berthe Morisot's work of 1881-84.  This trans-
