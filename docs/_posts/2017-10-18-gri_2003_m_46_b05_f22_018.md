      that wonderful cupola of the Resurrection now in fragments partly in the Quirinal and some at the Vatican Museum.
         I look forward to seeing the ring - it sounds nice.
         I look forward also to hearing more about "the Sonnet Bassier".
         I slept better last night.  In fact very well.  The Woods are going away this Friday so there will be no question of my coming up before you come.  I really must work hard here anyway.  I hope you are sleeping again now.
         Tell me about your lectures.  Please keep the cutting as I will send you the film article which is in part on the back.
         I adore you.  I love you.
