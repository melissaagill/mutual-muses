      Dearest Sylvia
      Today I am going to S E A and I will
      send you, by a letter post, Athene. I do
      hope you like it. Yawalla says - it
      sounds better than the last one - at least
      there's some color & lots of pictures.
      I have been reading some new poems by
      Wallace Stevens. One has the title -
      The Desire To Make Lve in a Pagoda
      & I have read the fairy tale of e.e.
      cummings:
      Once there was a house who fell in love
      with a [unclear]hind.[/unclear] This house was tall & empty
      & had a great many windows.
      That is its charming beginning.
      This evening I am going to see [unclear]Pannons,[/unclear]
      partly to talk the book ones, partly to meet some
      people as he is having a small sort of
      party. There is a German painter & I
      forget the rest of the cast.

      Dearest Sylvia
      Today I am going to SEA and I will
      send your, by a letter post, Athene.  I do
      hope you like it.  Yawalla says it
      sounds better than the last one-at least
      there's some color in lots of pictures.
      I have been reading some new poems by
      Wallace Stevens.  One has the title--
      The Desire to Make Love in a Pagoda:
      and I have rea it a fairy tale by e.e.
      Cummings.
      Once there was a  house who fell in love
      with a lind.  This house was tall and empty
      and had a great many windows.
      That is the charming beginning
      This evening I am going to see Parsons,
      partly to talk the book over, partly to meet some
      people as he is gaving a small sort of
      party.  There is a German painter and I
      forget the rest of the cast.
