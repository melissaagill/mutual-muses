      Dearest Lawrence,
      Thank you for your two letters
      we are delighted to hear that you
      are on the short list, and very dis-
      appointed that you cannot come
      for the Fete--but of course it would
      be very foolish to jeopardize your position
      at the Tate--even for the Fete!  But
      we shall miss you very much for
      we depend on you to make things go
      with a swing and to keep our spirits
      up.  Tiny suggests that you should
      come the following week-end to help
      to clear up!  Then I could finish my
      beach picture perhaps.
      I am very interested in your
      ideas of love-making in British films
      and truth as publicitiy"--I read it to
