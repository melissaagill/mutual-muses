      30 August 1951
      My dearest Sylvia,
      I must tell you straight away - I have not
      been offered the Birmingham job. I am not
      sure why not, but they have taken a Courtauld
      student and a girl about whom I discovered
      nothing. Though I am chagrined and fully
      realise I must be sure of getting another
      post (and quickly) there is an element
      of relief, I must admit: though I admired
      the Cathedral again (you know it is by
      Thomas Archer) the rest of the city struck
      me again as intolerably claustrophobic -
      amusing for a night's lecture, oppressive
      for a year. However, I must not ration-
      alise what is, I admit, an intense disappoint-
      ment.
      Yes I have applied to the N.G. I am
      going to apply to the Tate when the date
      approaches. No I haven't sent the poem to
      Sir O. but I am in the throes of rewriting
      it, to do so. I have not got your nice long
      letter with me so am not sure what your
      other questions were but I will answer the
      remainder of cat's catechism in tomorrow's
      letter.

      what is, I admit an intense disappoint-<br/>ment.<br/>Yes I have applied to
      the NG.  I am<br/>going to apply to the Tate when the date<br/>approaches.  No
      I haven''t sent the poem to<br/>Sir O. but I am in the throes of rewriting<br/>it,
      to do so.  I have not got your nice long<br/>letter with me so am not sure what
      your<br/>other questions were but I will answer the<br/>remainder of cat''s
      cathechism in tomorrow''s<br/>letter.'
