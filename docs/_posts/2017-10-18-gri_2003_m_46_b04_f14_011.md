      I love you so much. Oh! I
      read your letter from A.N. to
      [unclear]?[/unclear] and she thought it very good
      Clifford wants me to read it to
      him - he's very amused and says
      the younger generation is knocking
      at the door - and you're a father -
      figure! Poor Hetty!!

      I enclose a book list from
      Tiny.

      test and time for writing this week.
      By the way don't forget to write
      to "World Review" and suggest
      the Orson Wells article and
      don't forget to urge your claim
      to write on films in "Art News"
      I see in the "Art Jobs" in "Art News" columns
