      Saturday

      Dearest Sylvia:

      I hope the enclosed notes on painters are useful though I have my doubts: I didn't realise quite how out-of-date Bryan was. I had to reject an awful lot of junk. (I'll try and find something about Ercole de Roberti by Wednesday.)

      Thinking about you after reading the notes in the Whitechapel Gallery catalogue something like this occured to me:

      Sleigh, Sylvia. English school. Latin sympathies. Famous in the forties as a lecturer on art though her reputation now rests primarily on her portraits and lanscapes in oil, in which medium she appears to have worked exclusively. Of especial interest is a landscape, of a gay character, variously identified, but probably of Sussex, dated summer, 1948; and a portrait of an un-identified poet, painted, on stylistic evidence, at the same period...

      February, the interminable corridors of every surrealist picture ever painted; March, a mass of ice and rock balanced on the edge of a precipice, which will not fall for 31 days; April, the number of waves that break on the shore of Cythera; May, the extraordinary sense of crisis with which the dead endure the centuries before judgment. JUNE: no image at all to do this month justice. Capitals alone satisfy.

      I hope you are not too tired after yesterday and that dreadful night-journey... My cold isn't too bad today. I did have rum and lemon last night and I shall stop in for the rest of today (it's 2-30) except for posting this letter which I am resolved you shall have first post Monday... I am so angry at the thought of having to prepare an essay for clifton-taylor; all I remember from his lectures is you next to me, and Angelica Kauffmann when the lights go on... Last night once when I looked at you I saw Iris beyond: her attitude, which is NOT life-accepting, seems externalised now, creeping out into her tight lips. (These disconnected sentences would get no more marks from c.t. than your long Proustian ones.)

      Do you remember those letters of Manet's decorated with water-colors?

      Saturday
      Dearest Sylvia:
      I hope the enclosed notes on painters are useful though I have by doubts: I didn't realize quite how out-of-date Bryan was. I had to reject an awful lot of junk. (I'll try and find something about Ereole de Roberti by Wednesday.)
      Thinking about you after reading the notes in the White-chapel Gallery catalog something like this occurred to me:
      Sleigh, Sylvia. English school. Istin sympathies. Famous in the forties, as a lecturer or art though her reputation now rests primarily on her portraits and landscapes in oil, in which medium she appears to have worked exclusively. Of especial interest is a landscape, variously identified, but  probably of Sussex, dated summer, 1948 ,of a gay character; and a portrait of an un-identified poet, painted, on stylistic evidence, at the same period...
      February, the interminable corridors of every surrealist picture ever painted; March, a mass of ice and rock balanced on the edge of a precipice, which will not fall for 31 days; April, the number of waves that break on the shore of Cythera; May, the extraordinary sense of crisis with which the dead endure the centuries before judgment. JUNE: no image at all to do this month justice. Capitals alone satisfy.
      I hope you are not too tired after yesterday and that dreadful night-journey... & cold isn't too bad today. I did have rum and lemon last night and I shall stop in for the rest of today (it's 2-30) except for posting this letter which I am resolved you shall have first post Monday... I am so angry at the thought of having to prepare an essay for clifton-taylor; all I remember from his lectures is you next to me, and Angelica Kauuffmann when the lights go on... last night once when I looked at you I saw Iris beyond: her attitude, which is NOT life-accepting, seems externalized now, creeping cut into her tight lips. (These disconnected sentences would get no more marks from c.t. than your long Proustian ones.)
      Do you remember those letters of Manet's decorated with water colors?

      Wimbledon.

      Saturday

      Dearest Sylvia:

      I hope the enclosed notes on painters are useful though
      I have my doubts: I didn't realise quite how out-of-date
      Bryan was. I had to reject an awful lot of junk. (I'll
      try and find something about Ercole de Roberti by Wednesday.)

      Thinking about you after reading the notes in the White-
      chapel Gallery catalogue something like this occurred to me:

      Sleigh, Sylvia. English school. [unclear]Latin[/unclear] sympathies.
      Famous in the forties as a lecturer [unclear]of[/unclear] art though her
      reputation now rests primarily on her portraits and
      landscapes in oil, in which medium she appears to have
      worked exclusively. Of especial interest is a land-
      scape of a gay character, variously identified, but probably of Sussex, dated
      summer, 1948; and a portrait of an
      un-identified poet, painted, on stylistic evidence, at
      the same period...

      February, the interminable corridors of every surrealist
      picture ever painted; March, a mass of ice and rock balanced
      on the edge of a precipice, which will not fall for 31 days;
      April, the number of waves that break on the shore of Cythera;
      May, the extraordinary sense of crisis with which the dead
      endure the centuries before judgement. JUNE: no image at all
      to do this month justice. Capitals alone satisfy.

      I hope you are not too tired after yesterday and that dread-
      ful night-journey... [unclear]My[/unclear] cold isn't too bad today. I did have
      [unclear]rum[/unclear] and lemon last night and I shall stop in for the rest of to-
      day (it's 2-30) except for posting this letter which I am resolved
      you shall have first post Monday... I am so angry at the thought
      of having to prepare an essay for elifton-taylor; all I remember
      from his lectures is you next to me, and Angelica Kauffmann when
      the lights go on... Last night once when I looked at you I saw
      Iris beyond: her attitude, which is NOT life-accepting, seems
      externalised now, creeping out into her tight lips. (These dis-
      connected sentences would get no more marks from c.t. than your
      long Proustian ones.)

      Do you remember those letters of Manet's decorated with water-
      colors?
