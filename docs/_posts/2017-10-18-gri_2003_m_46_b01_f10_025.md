      This morning I am going o get my
      slides but first I intend to see what [unclear]Wilenski[/unclear]
      has to say about [unclear]connereation[/unclear] pieces. Thanks
      for the reference. May I dedicate my [unclear]Mozorti[/unclear]
      book to you?

      Your news of 5 a month is very good
      for we can use it keeping you supplied with
      paints and canvas - for you must paint like a Rubens, not like an [unclear]Elzheimer[/unclear], when we
      are together.

      [unclear]Mally[/unclear] sends her love. She has read
      half my new chapter and likes it very much [unclear]which[/unclear]
      is a good thing for she has not only technical know-
      ledge of the subject.

      How are you [unclear]making[/unclear] [unclear]Michael [/unclear] strong,
      and happier? I am glad but puzzled how you can do
      it without giving up your plans and I know you
      don't intend to do that. Will he accept the [unclear]Jjustice[/unclear]?

      Sylvia, my love, I adore you. I am
      hopelessly  fascinated by you and get determined
      to express my love fully
      I love you, I love you,
      Lawrence
