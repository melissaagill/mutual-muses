      I enclose a few more recent poems which, roughly,
      belong with it.

      I have managed to see a couple of musicians: 'The
      Farmer Takes a Wife' (very charming) and 'Small
      Town Girl' (quite charming) and this week there
      is a new one called 'I Come Melvin' with Don-
      ald O'Connor and Debbie Reynolds (you re-
      member them in 'Singing In The Rain'. I'm sure.

      The lecture business is fast at the moment, both
      last week and this (coming) week. My lectures
      seem to be better than they were, a month or two
      ago, I am glad to say.

      Only a few more days and we will be together in Wales.
      I am looking forward to that more than I can say.
      I love you so much.

      I adore you

      I enclose a few more recent poems which, roughly,
      belong with it.
      I have managed to see a couple of musicals: 'The
      Farmer Takes a Wife' (very charming) and 'Small
      Town Girl' (quite charming) and this week there
      is a new one called 'I love Melvin' with Don-
      ald O'Connor and Debbie Reynolds (you re-
      member them in 'Singin' In The Rain', I'm sure).
      The lecture business is fast at the moment, both
      last week and this (coming) week. My lectures
      seem to be better than they were, a month or two
      ago, I'm glad to say.
      Only a few more days and we will be together in Wales.
      I am looking forward to that more than I can say.
      I love you so much,
      I adore you
      Lawrence
