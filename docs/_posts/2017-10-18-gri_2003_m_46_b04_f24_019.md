      the significance of the landscape
      --did you see the two types of
      building they are somewhat hidden?
      You seem to have done quite
      well for presents--[unclear]Tim[/unclear] and Clifford
      give me the notepaper and chocolates
      (E. [unclear]Sharo[/unclear]) [unclear]Michael[/unclear] a pretty
      Victorian broach, the [unclear]mountains[/unclear]
      a large jar of preserved ginger
      The Phillips!  Crystallized fruit
      [unclear][/unclear] a [unclear]comb[/unclear] in a case and
