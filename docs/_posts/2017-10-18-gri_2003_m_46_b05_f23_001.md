      Dearest Lawrence

      I hope you had a pleasant journey. It was lovely to have you here. I hope you won't have to work too hard. I'm afraid I have caused you a rush today.

      Do let me know how your lecture goes tomorrow. Is it "Rennalt and Renoir"? When are the [unclear]Croyton[/unclear] portraits.

      I am very interested in your [unclear]steal autiele[/unclear], and I thought very highly of your book review. I don't think I read to the end though.
