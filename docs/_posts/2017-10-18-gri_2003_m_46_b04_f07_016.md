      The double plot of age and youth,
      Hoary beards and hairy chests, Juxtaposes coming and death.

      The moon hangs near tangled nests
      Like an udder near pails: the dark
      Is a column curved above the harvest.

      (It  rhymes.)

      I am afraid that the soles are not available at the drapers in your size: they only have ten-inch ones. Hetty wouldn't let Dandy buy them: no, she said, they can't be cut down, you/foolish lion.

      I picked some roses from the back garden yesterday: they make a lovely silent crimson explosion by the window, on the round table.
      I love you
      Lawrence
