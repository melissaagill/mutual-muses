      2 I 53 Blackheath Dearest Sylvia
      I am so unhappy to hear that you are not well. Do look after
      yourself, my love. Why do you feel 'rundown', my love? Tired I
      can understand after X'mas but not 'rundown'. I do hope your
      hand is not painful - at least, it is your right hand. Are you
      sleeping properly? It might be worth taking an anodyn or 2 -
      tho' without telling Tiny.
      I understand, of course, that you will not come, feeling as you
      do, until the 6th or 7th. Let me know which and I will meet you.
      I have an lecture on 6th which will be over about 4:15 (its at
      the TG) but on Wednesday I am free & could meet you at any time.
      I have noted all the other dates you mention and am so glad that we
      shall have some time together before I come to Pett.

      I have been writing some poems: some more on Houses and
      Rooms, one or two about the New Year, and this (the You is imper-
      sonal, let me add):

      You start from a wish for white,
      A rail of it in the mind,
      Ending up, after the splash,
      With sails, snow, and milk,
      Instead of using glasses
      In the winter to collect
      The snow, teeth, milk, sheets, semen -
