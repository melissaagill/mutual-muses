      thought perhaps we might see some
      exhibitions.  She couldn't manage
      Thursday.
      I am getting on well with my
      picture--but haven't finished as
      I had hoped--I have nearly
      finished to 3/4 portrait; the head
      is done and the body--the
      left arm and hand are stretched
      inwards towards the table indie
      afway the jewels.
      Friday
      Your letter arrived, I suppose
      mine were delayed by the fog.  I
      think I had better take the 10:10
      arriving Charing Cross at 11:53
      then perhaps we might do some
      exhibitions!  I'm longing to see you
      and 6.4 seems a bit late.  Then
      we need not stir ourselves too
      much otherwise.
      I love you dearest Lion
      I love you
      Sylvia
