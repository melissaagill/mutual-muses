      That's too bad about Iris. However, why don't you do as she sug-gests and send your sketches to Lilliput - saying that Britannia & Eve suggested you should contact them?

      Re-reading your story I like it even more. But why is Daphne 'a little withead'? She does not have the morbid purity of one of my characters the way you built her up: so, why, 'withead'? The way the points of view of the 2 girls changes during the course of their conversation is very skillful. Susan's self-betraying words to Basil are excellent: really, though, why don't you complete it with the girls' reactions to Basil's proposal? The characters may be trivial, as you say, but that's no reason for throwing them away suddenly. That's what Maurice does. Therefore, in the hope of your finishing it, I return your story.

      Also, I enclose what I have done of the TV operetta.

      This week I have several schoollectures at the NG and the TG.

      I love you, dearest Sylvia. Think of me. I adore you

      love you
