      IV

      Patterns of nostalgia unify
      The draughty gothic platforms
      Where the oracle mutters place names,
      The promenade as silent as below
      The surface of the sea-view it commands,
      Nostalgia for my love in the past.

      Landscapes succeed each other
      Unreal as a diorama
      Demonstrating the degrees of autumn,
      The purple, gold, and empty groves,
      Unreal compared to my flesh
      Predicting future summers with my love.

      v THE POET IN TOWN

      Rain is not a titan's tear,
      Nobody weeps in weather,
      But tonight as rain descends
      I dwell on poor lovers

      Lying apart at night
      While rain ticks crazily down
      From cornice to path,
      From orchard to the lawn.

      vi ON MY LOVE IN THE COUNTRY

      Villages are children of the signpost,
      That guardian angel, wooden-winged, who shows
      The superstitious traveller his choice;

      But posts are the orchard of knowledge
      And point a way out of the rural province.
      Already 'paradise' is seasonal.

      IV

      Patterns of nostalgia unify
      The draughty gothic platforms
      Where the oracle mutters place names,
      The promenade as silent as below
      The surface of the sea-view it commands,
      Nostalgia for my love in the past.

      Landscapes succeed each other
      Unreal as a diorama
      Demonstrating the degrees of autumn,
      The purple, gold, and empty groves,
      Unreal compared to my flesh
      Predicting future summers with my love.

      v THE POET IN TOWN

      Rain is not a titan's tear,
      Nobody weeps in weather,
      But tonight as rain descends
      I dwell on poor lovers

      Lying apart at night
      While rain ticks crazily down
      From cornice to path,
      From orchard to the lawn.

      vi  ON MY LOVE IN THE COUNTRY

      Villages are children of the sighpost,
      That guardian angel, wooden-winged, who shows
      The superstitious traveller his choice;

      But signposts are the orchard of knowledge
      And point a way out of the rural province.
      Already 'paradise' is seasonal.
