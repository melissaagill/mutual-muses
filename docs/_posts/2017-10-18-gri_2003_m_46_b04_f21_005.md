      3.9.'51
      Dearest Lawrence,
      I am most impressed by your
      "[unclear]Sudor[/unclear] Chapter". It is most lucid
      and informative. I have learnt a lot!
      and I think it extraordionarily use-
      ful in classifing the period wich
      on the face of it seems quite in-
      explicably chaotic. I was, of course
      particularly pleased by the Apolloinican
      [unclear]Serumphal death[/unclear] - wich pict me in
      much of my projected play. I really
      think I shall do something about it!
      If the rest of the book is as good
      as this chapter it should become
      a household word!
      I'm very interested to hear of Rayner.
      Bankham - he writes competantly - I
      have felt him to be knowledgable and
      very intelligent without being "cultured"
      in my sense of the word, or very
      sympathetic - though I often agree
      with him.
