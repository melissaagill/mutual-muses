      Wimbledon.

      Dearest Sylvia,

      Well, I got my steak as I hoped, and so kept my strength up for work. Then Mother came home and I got a second lunch though more modest. I did not tell her of the first.

      There is the smell of paint &c. about at present because Ricky is painting a portrait of Mother, in her red cross things. It reminds me very acutely and wistfully of the studio in which I sat for my portrait and the painter to whom I sat. Perhaps you have been in your studio this afternoon. I imagined you there.

      I love you, Sylvia. Do not doubt me. I look forward very excitedly to our meeting next Saturday. I will send you a cheque. Come by train it is quicker and it will make your return home less precise. You know what I mean. And I can come to East Croyden. Oh, Sylvia, I love you. Your letters do help me with their charm and their love and their news.

      Your account of filling in the landscape of our picture suggested the following poem to me:

      SYLVIA AS FLORA

      As Flora spends her avalanche of flowers
      On hills and hollows of the country
      So you my painter, lover, pagan,
      Populate the canvas with your signs.

      Your various disguises, none of them designed to confuse but only delight with variety, of Minerva, Painter, Cat, and more, are a symbol of the rich pleasure I find in your presence. O dearest I love you.

      Have you seen the new King Penguin of Durer woodcuts? It is splendid value for half-a-crown. I have been tremendously excited by it.

      I can now call you a villain: what a delightfully startling suggestion that there may be some rubbed paint at the lips of my portrait. I think the best thing is not to go on with your painting to correct this but make your model resemble your image. Nature catching up Art, &c. We shall prove it, darling.

      c3,600 words on The Rake's Progress await typing. I must get on to it and let Dilys Powell have it. So I must stop. I love you, Sylvia: thank you for your letters, I long for more, and I shall never stop loving you,

      in your presence. O dearest I love you. \n\nHave you seen the new King Penguin
      of Durer woodcuts? It is splendid value for half-a-crown. I have been tremendously
      excited by it.\n\nI can now call you a villain: what a delightfully startling
      suggestion that there may be some rubbed paint at the lips of my portrait. I

      make your model resemble your image. Nature catching up Art, &c. We shall prove
      it, darling.\n\n3,600 words on The Rake's Progress await typing. I must get
      to it and let Dilys Powell have it. So I must stop. I love you Sylvia: thank

      Sylvia, <br/><br/>Well, I got my steak as I hoped, and so kept my strength up
      for work. Then Mother came home and I got a second lunch though more modest.
      I did not tell her of the first. <br/><br/>There is the smell of paint &c.about
      at present because Ricky is painting a portrait of Mother, in her red cross
      things. It reminds me very acutely and wistfully of the studio in which I sat
      for my portrait and the painter to whom I sat. Perhaps you have been in your
      studio this afternoon. I imagined you there.<br/><br/>I love you, Sylvia. Do
      not doubt me. I look forward very excitedly to our meeting next Saturday. I
      will send you a cheque. Come by train it is quicker and it will make your return
