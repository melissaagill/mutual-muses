      2. Bangor about the next operetta -
      I gather they are not doing "The
      Maid of the Mountains". They are
      going to read "the Derest Song"!
      and they will probably do something by
      the same author - exactly the same
      only about gypsies! But I think
      I told you. During the exit from
      church Mrs Scheol (spelling?) asked
      me to lunch, which was very pleasant.
      Young [unclear][/unclear] was there and his scuptress.
      She seems very pleasant - loves [unclear][/unclear]
      doesn't like Giacometti - as she feels
      sculpture ought to have volume, and
      has something in the R.A.! very good
      I think - she hasn't finished her course
      yet. The young man is brighter then
      you think - we had quite a lively con-
      versation about eclesiastical architecture
      Vis a' vis Coventry. After lunch the yount
      thing went for a walk and before
      I went home Mrs Shewl showed me
      some of her very charming china.
      If you can't come nor the Clarks
