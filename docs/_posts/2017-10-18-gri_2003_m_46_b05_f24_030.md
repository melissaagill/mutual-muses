      Pett 23.12.52

      Dearest Lawrence,
      Here with the cheque - do apologise to your father for me for the delay. Thank you for your dashing letter. I'm so glad your Beerbohn lecture went well. I hope you had a good audience today. I wonder if my Aunt came? She did send me a very generous cheque - so far my father has only sent me a card. I expect you will have had my [unclear][/unclear] report by now.
      I am delighted to hear of your Yorkshire lectures - and of course you should take them - thank god they are not until the 9th. I will agree that your work will have been mainly done for me before the show opens - of course I must have you on the 5th and

      Herewith the cheque - do apologise
      to your father for me for the delay.
      Thank you for your darling letter.
      I'm so glad your Beerbohm lecture
      went well - I hope you had a good
      audience to-day. I wonder if my
      Aunt came? She did send me
      a very generous cheque - so far
      my father has only sent me a card.
      I expect you will have had my [unclear][/unclear]
      report by now.
      I am delighted to hear of your
      Yourshire lectures - and of course
      you should take them - thank God
      they are not until the 9th. I
      quite agree that your work will
      have been mainly done for me
      before the show opens - of course
      I must have you on the 5th and
