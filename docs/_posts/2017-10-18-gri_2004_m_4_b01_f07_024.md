      TWO DIALOGUES for Sylvia

      BEAUTY AND THE BEAST

      A dialogue of beast and beauty
      Overhear upon the shore
      Where the waves creep softly.
      'Did the clocktower wake you late?'
      'I was at the door all ready'.
      'You remarked the sleepy portrait?'
      'I was at school in Italy'.
      'You have not asked about the glove?'
      'Because you warned me of the claw'.
      So they walk, conversing on love.
      'You saw the hill upon the map?'
      'A place where flowers reach to man'.
      'Rest here, belle, in my fur lap'.
      'Where was I when love began?'

      THE SLEEPING BEAUTY

      'The brambles were thick as a witch's hair'.
      'At first I did not dream of you, nor stir'.
      'Rust gave the fountains a look of autumn'.
      'When you moved in the dead gardens I shivered'.
      'How dull they were in the gymnaseum'.
      'Slowly my ice became a dream of rivers'.
      'As I approached the tower where you lay fated
      The dust protested'.   'In my sleep I feared
      To lose the amber calm'.  'Now you are feted
      In season, by flowers, vivid in your hair'.
      'Sleep closes like a book and I forget'.
      'The briars are cleared, now, see, the fountains jet'.

      night of april 3-4

      I love you Lawrence

      TWO DIALOGUES for Sylvia
      BEAUTY AND THE BEAST
      A dialogue of beast and beauty
      Overheard upon the shore
      Where the waves creep softly.
      'Did the clocktower wake you late?'
      'I was at the door all ready'.
      'You remarked the sleepy portrait?'
      'I was at school in Italy'.
      'You have not asked about the glove?'
      'Because you warned me of the claw'.
      So they walk, conversing on love.
      'You saw the hill upon the map?'
      'A place where flowers reach to men'.
      'Rest here, belle, in my fur lap'.
      'Where was I wen love began?'

      THE SLEEPING BEAUTY
      'The brambles were thick as a witch's hair'.
      'At first I did not dream of you, nor stir'.
      'Rust gave the fountains a look of autumn'.
      'When you moved in the dead gardens I shivered'.
      'How dull they were in the gymnasium'.
      'Slowly my ice became a dream of rivers'.
      'As I approached the tower where you lay fated
      The dust protested'.  'In my sleep I feared
      To lose the amber calm'.  'Now you are feted
      In season, by flowers, vivid in your hair'.
      'Sleep closes like a book and I forget'.
      'The briars are cleared, now, see, the fountains jet'.

      night of april 3-4.
      I love you Lawrence
