      lion is adding bits to his longish vaguely defined poem but here
      is a short one he has finished for you:

      When you cannot sleep you are transporting
      lakes & wheelbarrows to the distance.
      Then you are surprised to swim and be scratched
      By old china in the creased lake-bed.
      Also the rocks are slippery green.

      Chimneys are warm on wings as buoys are bright
      On the full-surface of the lake
      Where you fliat perfectly among melting stars.
      Wind makes a ukelele of the wires
      Usual for messages, as though I phoned
      Cues for sleep in lulling metaphors.

      Here is a portrait of Dandy, reproducec from Lion News &Review, meaning his chain:
