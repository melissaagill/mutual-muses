      "The Aubrey" 8c.
      21st March 1949
      Dearest Syliva -
      Thank you for your letter: it is by me now.
      Alas, that you are sad and worried. No clear
      picture of the situation at [unclear]Pelt[/unclear] is contained in
      your letter except for occasional [unclear]jagged[/unclear]
      notes of anxiety and sadness. You ask for as-
      surance of my love. Here is a sonnet I have
      just written to ease your fear:
      Even in the calendar of absence
      That long life contains over works of love
      We keep them busy whom [unclear]Deine[/unclear] employed,
      The loves [unclear]altardant[/unclear] on the god of love.

      Putti who lately quarrelled for the nose,
      Made by our moth compete for letters now
      On [unclear]make[/unclear] a mirror of my tear
      And bear it to you with my image in it.

      With [unclear]wire, likely[/unclear] make a golden Tyranny,
      A net of memory to prison us,
      On with their wings pillow as [unclear]nestled[/unclear] heads
      Of loves sleeping disparate [unclear]& sharge[/unclear].

      Oh, in your absence love is not forgetful
      And putti sigh in hundreds as I wait.

      Believe me, dearest love, I adore you, I cannot
      say too often that I love you nor can I adequately
      define how much I love you, Sylvia.

      Made by our mouths compete for letters now
      Or make a mirror of my tear
      And bear it to you until my image in it.
      Will wires then make a golden tyranny,
      A net of memory to prison us,
      On with their wings pillow to restless heads
      Of lovers sleeping disparate & strange.
      Oh in your absence love is not forgetful
      And Putti sigh in hundreds as I wait.

      "The Aubreys" &c.
      21st March 1949
      Dearest Sylvia -
      Thank you for your letter: it is by me now.
      Alas, that you are sad and worried. No clear
      picture of the situation at Pett is contained in
      your letters except for occasional ragged
      notes of anxiety or sadness. You ask for as-
      surance of my love. Here is a sonnet I have
      just written to ease your fear:
      Even in the calenders of absence
      That hang like curtains ones works of love
      We keep them busy whom Desire employed,
      The loves attendance on the god of Love.
      Putti who lately quarelled for the roses
      Made by our mouths compete for letters noow
      Or make a mirror of my tears
      And bear it to you with my image in it.
      With wires they make a golden tyranny,
      A net of memory to prison us,
      Or with their wings pillow the restless heads
      Of lovers sleeping disparate & strange.
      Oh, in your absence love is not forgetful
      And putti sigh in hundreds as I wait.

      Believe me, dearest love, I adore you. I cannot
      say too often that I love you nor can I adequately
      define how much I love you, Sylvia.
