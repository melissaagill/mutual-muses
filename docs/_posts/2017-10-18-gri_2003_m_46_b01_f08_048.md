      I am glad things are less tense.  So glad.  How your letters have occupied me - even though sometimes unhappy - they are very important to me.
      Brian [unclear]Lyltle's[/unclear] book has been most use-ful to me and has drawn my attention to many things I would have missed - in-cluding counters of [unclear]Winchelrea's[/unclear] [unclear]tomb[/unclear].
      There's no real Romanesque at [unclear]Well,[/unclear] - even in the old North Porch.  For it is of a transitorial character.  I have discovered in The Circus a delightful frieze, above the Daric [unclear]andes[/unclear], if emblems, rarely repeating and going right round the circus - the Arts, occupations, virtues, [unclear]&c[/unclear] [unclear]&c[/unclear] are represented. [unclear]Here[/unclear] I saw some Baroque plaster [unclear]worls[/unclear] in one of the houses in Queen's Square which excited me very much.
      I've written about 400 lines of a poem on and about Bath. [unclear]It[/unclear] is only in a rough state.  The influence of the later Auden is apparent technically. How I admired In Praise of Limestone.  I've got Auden's new book too.
      I return tomorrow afternoon so this will be my last letter from Bath.
