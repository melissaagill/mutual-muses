      3.
      Let me know when you move - I hope while he is friendly you can stay for I'm sure that is nicer than being alone. Now mind you see the Sainte Chappelle and the windows of Notre Dame. And what about St. Denis?

      Your weather seems much better than ours - not unusual- it is al-ways windier here than anywhere else. I like the Luxembourg very much - I have been there a lot con-sidering my short stays in Paris. When I was there with M, in 1938 (or 7) I stayed quite near - only the opposite side. Your delightful poem is obviously "Morisot-ed"!

      I'm glad you like the "Sache" too - I should think the "Virgin" exhibition would be very charming - all pretty young ladies!

      I agree with yo strongly about Paris being very different - including that undrawable quality - its smell! I hate the idea of generalized cities
