      Dearest Sylvia
      I will post off your painting tomorrow. Thank you for the stamps which are certainly welcome. I have not got your letter with the dates with me but come as soon as you like. I'll be exact about the dates in tomorrow's letter.

      I have been all day at the Vand A, looking up books & reading articles for the [unclear]Harpenden[/unclear] course. I have to prepare a careful bibliography you know - in addition to the syllabus which of course I sent off some time ago

      I met Bernard Dennis & asked him if I could review Adrian [unclear]Meatl's [/unclear]exhibition of the Redfern. He said yes & to make it long. As Adrian has written a small book on abstract art I got an advance copy of it today & shall review it & his paintings
