      24th December 1948 Wimbledon.

      Dearest Sylvia,

      The gift from the Rectory Owls enchants me.  Will you kindly read to them this hurried but sincere thank you poem?

      Like a juggler eating fire
      Like a hat of clouds on the sun
      An owl sits on the flame
      And in the dark lovers meet
      As in the shadow of a wing
      Hidden by their totem
      Who eats fire every night.

      Dearest, he is delicious.  I admire him full-face and profile.  He is surprised and grave, naive and mysterious, hopeful yet possessed in expression.
      Thank you so much for him (he will be company for the other two as well as for me).  Your lyrical and witty gift is now my treasure.
      *  *  *
      You say in your letter that I am the only person you know who believes in love.  Dearest, remember who taught me love.  Do you no longer believe in its power then?  I am sure that you do, behind the tangle of conflicting im-
