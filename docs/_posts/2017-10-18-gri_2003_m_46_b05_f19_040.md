      3    expenses you would probably need
      and borrow again rather than pay
      me back.  By the way Tiny says,
      very sensibly that if Knox has
      gone to Newcastle--his Slade job
      must be going, so look out for that.
      Birmingham are advertizing again--
      any good your trying for that?
      I haven't had the heart to read
      your concrete article.
      I haven't done any work today
      as the weather was a bit too
      cloudy for the shore.  I went to
      coffee with Miss Cave, Chase has
      written for somewhere to stay for a
      week and I have been trying
      to find somewhere.  So far unsuccess-
      fully.
      Please go and see Hodde
      and Stotten--what about that
      fifth book--surely your father
      will pay your debts--he knows
      you have been trying for jobs
