      Paris 14 VII MCML
      Dearest Sylvia
      Paris is very noisy and restless. The celebrations began las night and will go on, I believe, tomorrow also. Sheet [unclear]dances[/unclear] began about 10.00 yesterday, under flags and paper lanterns. Today it has rained so I fear that some of the decorations will be damaged. I have not been out yet, it is afternoon, but the sounds of music & fireworks [unclear]suggest[/unclear] that no real interruption has occurred. I am glad to have a lazy day because I have not been early to bed once. This evening Peter & a Norwegian girl will be joining Jeanne Koepler, an American called Dick Brewer, and myself for the celebrations. Even as I write their names, however, I feel regret, nostalgia, that you are away in England. [unclear]Would[/unclear] you were here! Then we could see Cocteau's new film Les Enfants Terribles together, which is running at the Pavillion cinema (where I first saw la Belle et la Bete). I admire so well the way in which Paris has [unclear]wartime[/unclear] character and mood and can yet support so many foreign, cosmopolitan visitors - including some intelligent, liberal Americans, one or two of whom I have been lucky enough to meet. The other night, really late, bought Andre Bredon's L'Amour [unclear]Tou[/unclear]: in England one cannot buy a book after 5.30. I appreciate a city which allows one the right to shop at 1.15. I so which you were here for the galleries, the restaurants, and the walks in the evenings

      Paris                                             14 VII MCML

      Dearest Sylvia
      Paris is very noisy & restless.  The celebrations began last
      night and will go on, I believe, tomorrow also.  Street
      dances began about 10.00 yesterday, under flags and paper
      lanterns.  Today it has rained so I fear that some of the
      decorations will be damaged.  I have not been out yet,
      it is afternoon, but the sounds of music & fireworks sug-
      gest that no real interruption has occured.  I am glad
      to have a lazy day because I have not been early to
      bed once.  This evening Peter & a Norwegian girl will
      be joining Jeanne [unclear]Koepler[/unclear], an American called Dick
      Brewer, and myself for the celebrations.  Even as I write
      their names, however, I feel regret, nostalgia, that you
      are away in England.  Would you were here!  Then we
      could see Cocteau's new film Les Enfants Terribles to-
      gether, which is running at the Pantheon cinema (where I
      first saw la Belle et la Bete).  I admire so well the way in
      which Paris has a native character and mood and can yet
      support so many foreign, cosmopolitan visitors - including
      some intelligent, liberal Americans, one or two of whom I
      have been lucky enough to meet.  The other night, really
      late, I bought Andre Breton's L'amour Fou:  in England one
      cannot buy a book after 5.30.  I appreciate a city which al-
      lows   one the right to shop at 1.15.  I so wish you were here -
      for the galleries, the restaurants, and the walks in the
      evenings.
