      28th September 11 mansel road Wimbledon

      Dearest Sylvia,

      I, too, have been walking among hawthorn and wild rose hedges, in the hills around Bath.

      I am charmed by your slip: I wish it could have been realised in fact. Dandylion is most attached to the sun at Pett. (Changing identities rapidly I must confess that Apollo saw to it that he had good weather at Bath.)

      By the way, Dandylon, Apollo, Lawrie Scarlett, and me, are all delighted that your painting is easier again.  Four heart-felt congratulations.

      On the 30th and 31st of October my parents will be away.  Do you think you could time one of your visits on one of these days, or both? Would that be possible? My parents go away but rarely and it would save money.

      Back in town I can tell you the name of the translator of the Carracci sonnet - Creighton Gilbert, an American.  Another thing I learned on my return to the capital was that Ies Mains Salles came off last Saturday.  I am sorry to play about like this but it is of course unavoidable.

      I have not heard from Lines yet?

      About Cooper: I think he is too rough with Modigliani. I object when he says "De Chirico's images have no subjects... they cannot be expalin-ed'. His omission of Severini is cavalier. It is early to make some of the claims he does for the later Italians. But interesting nonetheless.

      I am glad your wardrobe is nearing completion. (Alas I don't think my trousers from Pett Fete will be ready in time.)

      I feel quite agitated when I think how near our next meeting is. I will write again tomorrow. I love you.

      Lawrence

      About Cooper: I think he is too rough with Modigliani.  I object when he says 'De Chirico's images have no subjects... they cannot be expalined [sic]'. His omission of Severini is cavalier. It is early to make some of the claims he does for the later Italians.  But interesting nonetheless.

      I am glad your wardrobe is nearing completion. (Alas I don't think my trousers from Pett Fete will be ready in time.)

      I feel quite agitated when I think how near our next meeting is.  I will write again tomorrow.  I love you.

      Lawrence.

      Sylvia,<br/><br/>I, too, have been walking among hawthorn and wild rose hedges,
      in the hills around Bath.<br/><br/>I am charmed by your slip: I wish it could
      have been realised in fact. Dandylion is most attached to the sun at Pett. (Changing
      identities rapidly I must confess that Apollo saw to it that he had good weather
      at Bath)<br/><br/>By the way, Dandylion, Apollo, Lawrie Scarlett and me, are
      all delighted that your painting is easier again.  Four heart-felt congratulations.<br/><br/>On
      the 30th and 31st of October my parents will be away. Do you think that you
      could time one of your visits on one of those days, or both? Would that be possible?
      My parents go away but rarely and it would save money<br/><br/>Back in town
      I can tell you the name of the translator of the Carracci sonnet - Creighton
      Gilbert, an American. Another thing I learned on my return to the capital was
      that Les Mains Salles came off last Saturday.  I am sorry to play about like
      this but it is of course unavoidable.<br/><br/>I have not heard from Lines yet?<br/><br/>About
      Cooper: I think he is too rough with Modigliani.  I object when he says ''De
      Chirico''s images have no subjects... they cannot be expalined [sic]''. His
      omission of Severini is cavalier. It is early to make some of the claims he
      does for the later Italians.  But interesting nonetheless.<br/><br/>I am glad
      your wardrobe is nearing completion. (Alas I don''t think my trousers from Pett
      Fete will be ready in time.)<br/><br/>I feel quite agitated when I think how
      near our next meeting is.  I will write again tomorrow.  I love you.<br/><br/>Lawrence.'
