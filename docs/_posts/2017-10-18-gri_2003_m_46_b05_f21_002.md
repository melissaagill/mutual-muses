      in the clouds already.  I love you so
      much, my adored poet, let me know
      that you are well.
      I shall be most interested to hear too
      how your chapter or episodie
      films is going now that you have
      seen "Lo Ronde".  For in spite of my
      apparent[unclear] cathentist[/unclear] I am very
      interested in the points you raised
      on the various films of this type
      and on your analysis of the
      Maryhans films.  Perhaps you will
      bring it when you come? Unless
      I do come to town on or near the
      11th I will see! but I feel
      I should get on with my work
      here. However I will let you know
      at once if there is any chance of
      it. I will finish this at Pett.
      In the bus. It stoped raining
      now- the train was punctual
      and after struggling from the station
      in record time I find home
      time to spare!

      in the clouds already. I love you so
      much, my adored poet, let me know
      that you are well.
      I shall be most interested to hear too
      how your chapter on episode
      films is going now that you have
      seen "La Ronde". For in spite of my
      apparent inattention I am very
      invested in the points you raised
      on the various films of this type
      and on your analysis of the
      [unclear]mayhem[/unclear] films. Perhaps you will
      bring it when you come? Unless
      I do come to town on or near the
      11th I will see! But I feel
      I should get on with my work
      here. However, I will let you know
      at once if there is any chance of
      it. I will finish this at Pett.
      In the bus. Its stopped raining
      now - the train was punctual
      and after struggling from the station
      in record time I find I have
      time to spare!
