      WEDNESDAY
      11 MANSEL ROAD
      WIMBLEDON SW19

      Dearest Sylvia,

      I love you.  Why do I start like that?  Simply because I do not think I have started a letter like that before.  One tends to end with those words.  They make a fine conclusion but they make the best opening too.

      How often you occur to my imagination.  I stand a little back, as it were, so that I can see you full-length against the Italian scene - or the vague dazzling thing which stands for that landscape.  I thought of you yesterday at my lecture: I mentioned Vermeer's interest in emblems and though I kept on talking I remember most distinctly our trip to Greenwich, and I then thought of you and where you might be THEN, at about a quarter past eleven.  Your new dress is almost known to me by now.

      About 70 people came to the lecture.  I put in De Hooch as well as the others because I had time to kill at the end.  I think it went alright and I no longer wish for the lights to go out and the first slide to come on screen.  Claire was there and she said I ought to speak up more in the big room vii.

      I have been twice to the Grand Ballet de Monte Carlo and seen Balanchine's Concerto Barocco, Lifar's Noir et Blanc, and Five Gifts which has decor and costumes by Leonor Fini whom I like as you know.  She made quite a successful design for the piece.  Later in the season they doing Les Fiches (Laurencin decor) and a ballet by Dali and Paul Bowles.  They are a fairly good company:  Eglevsky is with them now and they have a fine ballerina in Rosalla Hightower.  It was good to see ballet again after so long.

      I had a welcome surprise from the bank today.  I actually have over nine pounds in my account.  How much pleasanter this news than the overcharging in Michael's last statement.

      My visit to Bath will start on the 18th and be either a long weekend or a week.  The 18th of September, I mean.

      Has your Italian come back to you or did you rely on French when you were at school? And I would be interested to hear if Michael's yellow text book proved useful?

      WEDNESDAY
      11 MANSEL ROAD
      WIMBLEDON SW19

      Dearest Sylvia

      I love you. Why do I start like that? Simply because I do not think I have started a letter like that before. One tends to end with those words. They make a fine conclusion but they make the best opening too.

      How often you occur to my imagination. I stand a little back, as it were, so that I can see you full-length against the Italian scene - or the vague dazzling thing which stands for that landscape. I thought of you yesterday at my lecture: I mentioned Vermeer's interest in emblems and though I kept on talking I remembered most distinctly our trip to Greenwich, and I then thought of you and where you might be THEN, at about a quarter past eleven. Your new dress is almost known to me by now.

      About 70 people came to the lecture. I put in De Hooch as well as the others because I had time to kill at the end. I think it went alright and I no longer wish for the lights to go out and the first slide to come on the screen. Claire was there and she said I ought to speak up more in the big room vii.

      I have been twice to the Grand Ballet de Monte Carlo and seen Balanchine's Concerto Barocco, Lifar's Noir et Blanc, and Five Gifts which has decor and costumes by Leonor Fini whom I like as you know. She made quite a successful design for the piece. Later in the season they are doing Les Biches (Laurencin decor) and a ballet by Dali and Paul Bowles. They are a fairly good company: Eglevsky is with them now and they have a fine ballerina in Rosalla Hightower. It was good to see ballet again after so long.

      I had a welcome surprise from the bank today. I actually have over nine pounds in my account. How much pleasanter this news than the overcharging in Michael's last statement.

      My visit to Bath will start on the 18th and be either a long weekend or a week. The 18th of September I mean.

      Has your Italian come back to you or did you rely on French when you were at school? And I would be interested to hear if Michael's yellow text book proved useful?

      Simply because I do not think I have started a letter like that before. One
      tends to end with those words. They make a fine conclusion but they make the
      best opening too.<br/><br/>How often you occur to my imagination. I stand a
      little back, as it were, so that I can see you full-length against the Italian
      scene - or the vague dazzling thing which stands for that landscape. I thought
      of you yesterday at my lecture: I mentioned Vermeer''s interest in emblems and
      though I kept on talking I remembered most distinctly our trip to Greenwich,
      and I then thought of you and where you might be THEN, at about a quarter past
      eleven. Your new dress is almost known to me by now.<br/><br/>About 70 people
