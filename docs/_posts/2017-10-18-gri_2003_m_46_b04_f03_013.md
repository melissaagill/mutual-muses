      the small hours wore on I developed a [unclear]squeaky[/unclear] voice which is now a sore throat and a cold of a kind. Poor [unclear]Dandy[/unclear], who so longs to dazzle Matty with chatter, is reduced to wheezy monosyllables. But I am resolved to recover speedily and I hope my next letter will convey that news.

      I am sorry that the [unclear]Ferronese[/unclear] book is not one we can keep. Such conditions from a  publisher are rare - but not unknown. Will you, anyway, write 150-200 words about it? Rather than antagonise any publishers at this stage I accept this decision. Do you not think that the colour plates are a silly choice, being confined to England, & of poor quality. Don't hesitate to say so, if you think so. My review of Stokes' Rough & [unclear]??oath[/unclear] is headed 'Rough going'. Is that too flippant? Anyway it, and most of the May number, is at the printer's now.

      Forgive me Sylvia that I worried you by my long silence. You will have read my explanation - but do forgive me. I love you.

      the small hours wore on I developed a husky voice which is now a sore throat and a cold of a kind. I believe I shall have to postpone Bourteod tomorrow. Poor Dandy, who so [unclear]longs[/unclear] to dazzle Hetty with chatter, is reduced to wheezy mono-syllables. But I am resolved to recover speedily and I hope my next letter will convey that news.
      I am sorry that the Ferrarere book is not one we can keep. Such conditions from a publisher are rare - but not unknown. Will you, anyway, write 150-200 words about it? Rather than antagonize any publishers at this stage I accept their decision. Do you not think that the colour plates are a silly choice, being confined to England, & of poor quality. Don't hesitate to say so, if you think so. My review of Stokes' Rough & Smooth is headed 'Rough Going'. Is that too flippant? Anyway it, and part of the way number, is at the printer's now.
      Forgive me Sylvia that I worried you by my long silence. You will have read my explanation - but do forgive me. I love you.
