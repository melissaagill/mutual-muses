      Blackheath
      Sunday 20-X1-1999

      Dearest Sylvia,

      First let me give you the first Hetty poem, one of many you may be sure.

      In the equivocal afternoon
      We view the term in profile;
      On our terms, not on his,
      Discuss how the sexes feel
      In their bodily exchanges.

      Sleeping did we touch two snakes
      Twined in green and serpent love
      That now we are disordered
      And I am feminine above
      What is masculine below?

      The two-way looking term commands
      A double-world of moon and sun:
      As singleness of aim is lost
      We own both properties in one,
      Pleasures doubled at half the cost.

      (The snakes are those Tiresias struck and which turned his sex from male to female.)

      I have also written two pastorals, both of them the result of the train of thought and feeling set in motion by your new Hetty picture. First is a rococo one, same period as Hetty, of course:

      Pedants, country-girls, and huntsmen
      Move lazily in the evening's grey frieze
      Among the mossy stone of terms and stags.

    clean_transcription: Blackheath Sunday 20-1-1949<br/>Dear Sylvia,<br/>First let
      me give you the first Hetty poem, one of many you may be sure ;<br/>In the equivocal
      afternoon<br/>We view the term in profile;<br/>on our terms, not on his, <br/>discuss
      how the sexes fell<br/>in their bodily exchanges.<br/>Sleeping did we touch
      two snakes<br/>Twined in green and serpent love<br/>That now we are disordered<br/>And
      I am feminine above<br/>what is masculine below?<br/>The two-way looking term
      commands<br/>A double-world of moon and sun:<br/>As singleness of aim is lost<br/>We
      own both properties in one,<br/>Pleasures doubled at half the cost.(The snakes
      are those Tiresias struck and which turned his sex from male to female.)<br/>I
      have also written two pastorals, both of them the result of the train of thought
      and feeling set in motion by your new Hetty picture. First is a rococo one,
      same period as Hetty, ofcourse.<br/>Pedants, country-girls, and huntsmen<br/>Move
      lazily in the evening's grey frieze<br/>Among the mossy stone of terms and stage.<br/>
