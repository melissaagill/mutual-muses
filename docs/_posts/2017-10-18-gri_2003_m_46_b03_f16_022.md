      I have read 'Polydore' again carefully twice, and I think now I understand and appreciate the rhythm - There are lots of little points I should like to ask you - mainly out of curiosity. Do tell me the anagram of 'Welcome' though. - oh and I am not quite sure of the first line of verse 9. "One of the poets at one of the doors" seems a little clumsy? Perhaps I am wrong - I will read it again. I am perhaps hypercritical as all your other lines are so supple.
      I find I have your nail file in my bag - I enclose it - please could you send mine as I expect M. will want one to take with him.
      I think I shall post this now without waiting to see if you have  sent me a letter this morning - so you may get it sooner and I expect I may not have time to write more today.
      I love you, my  darling, and thank

      3 I have n "Polydoce' again carefully twice, and I think now I understand and appreciate the rhythm-there are lots of little points I should like to ask you - mainly out of curiosity.  Do tell me the anagaui of 'welcome' through -  and I am not quite sure of the first live of verse I "one of the poets at one of the doors" seems a little clumsily?  Perhaps of a wrong - I will read it again.  I am perhaps hypercritical as all your often times are so supple.
      I find I have your nail file my bag- I enclose it - please could you send mine as I expect   Will want one to take with him
      I think I shall post this now without waiting to see if you have sent me a letter this morning - so you may get it sooner and I expect I may not have time to write more to-day:
      Ilove you, my darling and think
