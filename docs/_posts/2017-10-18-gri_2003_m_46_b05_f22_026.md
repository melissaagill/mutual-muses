      3 Isn't it a nuisance I have to have Nora to tea to-morrow I'm so tired of her soul - I told her it would have to be in the studio as I am busy.
      I hope you have a very successful and enjoyable time at Lincoln. I must fly to the post with this. - I hope Banstead went well.
      I love you - sweet poet
      I love you
