      (at least) needing attention!
      I hear from a friend that there may be -
      no, will be - a vacency at Mull [unclear][/unclear] for
      which I am about qualified - a lecturing
      post. It has not been advertised yet.

      The Navigator was marvellous: I plan
      to write something about it & will send
      you that when it is done. Viva Keaton -

      Turnbull was pleasant yesterday,
      and I had an enjoyable evening, see-
      ing his new work (not much of it
      really) & borrowing photographs and
      [unclear][/unclear]- [That is a see "quote".]

      Ithell approves her foreward & offers
      me a drawing or collage! Diy that!

      I am en route for Banstead now.
      Almost time to get on that boring 93,
      that intermirable 164. Maybe for
      the last time.
      Look after yourself
      I love you
      Lawrence

      (at least) needing attention!

      I hear from a friend that there may be- no, will be-  a vacancy at [unclear]Miell[/unclear] shortly for which I am about qualified- a lecturing post, It has not been advertised yet.

      "The Navigator" was marvellous: I plan to write something about it and will send you that when it is done. Viva Keaton.

      Turnbull was pleasant yesterday and I had an enjoyable evening, seeing his new work (not much of it really) and borrowing photographs and parleying (that is a see "quote".)

      Ithell approves her foreward and offers me a drawing or collage! Dig that!

      I am en route for Banstead now. Almost time to get on that boring 93, that interminable 164. Maybe for the last time.

      Look after yourself

      Love you
      Lawrence
