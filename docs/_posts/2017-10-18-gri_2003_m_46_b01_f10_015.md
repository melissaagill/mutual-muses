      Surround me, but their muses
      Are quite invisible

      How did the painters miss them -
      Those ladies who inspired
      Such varied gentlemen
      To capture love in nets of words?

      Oh, the features cannot tell,
      The pirate from the lyricist.
      But it is my privilege
      To be represented with,
      Elegant, dazzling, at my side,
      My lover and my muse.

      Our double portrait will perhaps be one
      of the most romantic and tender pictures
      in the NPG of the future, an inspiration
      to lovers.

      I love you very much and long for our happiness which is not far away. Do
      not fear about your decision for remember
      what has led up to it as well as what we
      can do for one another with our love.

      What I would ask of you is - can you
      write a little more frequently? I know the obstacles but don't exaggerate them.
      Please try for I delight in every word
      you send and letters do inspire me to
      work. You will understand this I know.
