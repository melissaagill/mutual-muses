      Feel welcome and regret,
      Ambivalently turn
      From his North to my South.

      He keeps, the Northern one,
      The bride's antagonist
      With flask of love unopened,
      To the basalt alcove,
      Deep as a skull, in which
      There is not room for two.

      A sunflower grows and traces
      The sun across the sky;
      So shall I escort your beauty
      From sleep to art and love,
      From lack to a sense of
      Community with love

      We scale the ladders of
      The calender to greet
      The coming year, who wears
      The flowery robe of love,
      Months like jewels in her hair.
      January is a ruby.

      Smile, like roses at the light,
      For, as we meet, the year's
      Glacial fears must melt
      And irrigate the Spring:
      I know that all will be
      Well, my naked lover.
