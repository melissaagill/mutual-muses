      2 that it was ! In fact I really think it is rather like me! I am having a frame cut for it and if you would like it you shall have it as a pre show present!
      I finished Blacker yesterday and I am making my usual interminable notes! So I enclose a book of stamps to defray any expenses. I hope to send it back to you by Tuesday. And thank you so much for letting me have it and for renewing it so often. I don't really think I shall have to - but there is that possibility of lecturing to the W.I in March and while I have the book I may as well make the necessary notes so I shall be ready in case of emergency.
      I am now reading [unclear]JJoel[/unclear] Harvey's memoirs which are entirely delightful and filling a gap in my historical knowledge in the pleasantest possible way - it might even improve my style!

      2 that it was!  In fact I really think it is rather like me!  I am having a [unclear]beanie[/unclear] cut for it and if you would like it you shall have it as a pre-show present!
      I finished Blacker yesterday and I am making my usual interminable notes!  so I enclose a book of stamps to defray any expenses _ I hope to send it back to you by Tuesday.  And thank you so much for letting me have it and for renewing it for after _ I don't really think I shall have to _ but there is that possibility of lecturing to the WI in March and while I have the book I may as well make the necessary notes so I shall be ready in case of emergency.
      I am now reading Lord Harveys Memoire which are entirely delightful.  and filling a gap in my historical knowledge in the pleasantest possible way _it might even improve my style!
