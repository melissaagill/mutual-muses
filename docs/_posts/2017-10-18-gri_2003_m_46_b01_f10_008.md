      much your presence.  You have inspired me to write as it is but with you how happy I shall be.  I am doing the chapter on the Conversation Pieces at the moment.  How nice if I were able to show you the photographs and discuss them and ask your opinion.  That is why I look forward to writing a book with you:  our collaboration would encourage us and widen the ordinary critical approach.  All the work you are doing now on Klingender is splendid preparation for Wright.  I still have, of course, the small book on him.  I intend to write to Anthony Blunt who will know if anybody else is interested in Wright or Dobson.  What is our approach to be?  Fairly complete - artistic biographical, sociological?  The print room of the B.M. will contain many of those fine mezzotints of Wright Which will be useful.

      Wimbledon:  what a place to live in! I value your visit here as a Cytherean must have valued Venus choice of his island to land on first after her birth.  How dark the day is by tea-time.  46 shopping days to Christmas say the placards in the stores.  Soon, then, the new year.

      Well, my naked lover, The daedal past is answered And you are glad and sad,
