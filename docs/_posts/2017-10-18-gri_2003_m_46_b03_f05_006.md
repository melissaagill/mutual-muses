      5 June 1950
      Dearest Sylvia -
      Your letter today seems to make out-of--date one or two things in the letter you should receive this morning.  Don't worry about a theatre until I've more information.

      How sweet of the Woods, buying one of your pictures.  I do think they are nice.  Which one have they taken?

      To answer your inquiries about work:  yesterday I rewrote, extended, & typed the portrait chapter which is a good one now, with a new discovery.  I have not touched Gilpin but hope to finish it in a day or 2.  I have some more quotations for The [unclear]Jollasy[/unclear]of Height but no more.  I have put my poems first and the results are satisfactory.  The Poet in the Garden now wants three lines only.  Rinaldo & Armida is about dominant woman and [unclear]Karigintal[/unclear] man.

      I am glad to hear you feel so vigorous and are working on a painting of pansies.  What a fire cat you are.

      I suggest Saturday 10th of June to see [unclear]me here[/unclear].  I could as I have to go to my parents silver anniversary party for a few hours in the evening.  I should write now if I were you suggesting this date.
         I love you
         Lawrence

      5 June 1950
      Dearest Sylvia -
      Your letter today seems to make out-of-date one or
      two things in the letter you should receive this morning.
      Don't worry about the theatre until I've more information.
      How very sweet of the Woods, buying one of your pictures. I do think they are nice. Which one have they taken?
      To answer your enquiries about work: yesterday I re-
      wrote, extended, & typed the portrait chapter which is a
      good one now, with a new discovery. I have not touched
      Gilpin but hope to finish it in a day or 2. I have some
      more quotations for The Fallacy of Height but no
      [unclear]?[/unclear]. I have put my poems first and the results
      are satisfactory. The Poet in the Garden now wants three
      lines only. Rinaldo & Armida is about dominant
      woman and horizontal man.
      I am glad to hear you feel so vigorous and are working
      on a painting of pansies. What a fire cat you are.
      I suggest Saturday 10th of June to see Mrs Mac-
      Donald as I have to go to my parents silver anniversary
      party for a few hours in the evening. I should write no
      if I were you suggesting this date.
      I love you
      Lawrence
