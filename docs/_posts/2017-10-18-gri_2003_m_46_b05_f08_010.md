      Sunday: August: 1952 [10-8-52]
      Dearest Sylvia
      We are having plenty of rain here- I hope that the cup of your garden is full, too.
      Alas, I do not think I can got to Bath as soon as you. I have too many lectures I August to allow me to get away this month. Per-haps in September ... IC is too early to decide on dates just yet.
      Thank you for sending me the clipping about Bristal. I am most interested in it. I would have no objections to living in Bris-tal - it's a charming town. I am not sure my qualifications are quite right but I shall certainly try for it.
       About [unclear]Parmore[/unclear]: yes, I like him ratles. he is not 'pompous & pontifical' with men, however he may treat his wife. I gather from Hill that he keeps an eye and a firm hand on the ground round him so that there shall not be serious deviations from abstraction, but that is something else. I will send you a report of today's tea.
      If you come on Saturday or you anticipate I will meet you if I possibly can. I am lecturing but will be free, of course, after 4.00 or 4.15. IC is at the Tate.
      Smart has not yet paid me. He must have departed for Italy before he received the Burlingtons. I think you need not fear, however, for his is a scrupulous & conscientious man. [unclear][/unclear] I know you consider I am not. As soon as I get his cheque you shall have it.
      I hope you have a pleasant time with Mrs Clarke.
      Modelaine painted me on Friday last - a large board, with me full-length in pose reminiscent of Modigliani's' Petit Payson. Indeed the whole thing is rather curved & flat in Modelaine's manner. It is coloured, not a black & white. I am sitting for her again tomorrow afternoon.

      Albert Pasmore:  yes, I like him rather.  He is not 'pompous and
      pontifical' with men, however he may treat his wife.  I gather
      from Hill that he keeps an eye, and a frim hand, on the group
      round him so that there shall not be serious deniations from
      abstration, but that is something else.  I will send you

      Sunday: August: 1952 [10-8-52]

      Dearest Sylvia,
      We are having plenty of rain here - I hope that the cup of your garden
      is full, too.
      Alas, I do not think I can go to Bats as soon as you. i have too
      many lectures in August to allow me to get away this month. Per-
      haps in September... It is too early to decide on date just yet.
      Thank you for sending me the clipping about Bristol. I am most
      interested in it. I would have no objection to lining Bris-
      tol - it's a charming town. I am not sure my qualifications
      are quite niger but I shall certainly try run it.
      About Pasmore: yes, I like him rather. He is not 'pompous &
      pontifical' with men, however he may treat his wife. I gather
      from Hill that he keeps an eye, and a firm hand, on the group
      round him so that there shall not be serious deviations from
      abstraction, but that is something else. I will send you
      a report of today's tea.
      If you come on Saturday as you anticipate I will meet
      you if I possibly can. I am lecturing but will be free, of course, after 4.00 or 4.15. It is at the Tate.
      [unclear]Ewart[/unclear] has not yet paid me. He must have deported for
      Italy before he received the Burlington. I wish you need
      not fear, however, for he is a scrupulous & conscientious man,
      tho' I know you consider I am not. As soon as I get his
      cheque you shall have it.
      I hope you have a pleasant time with Mrs. Clarke.
      Modelaine painted me on Friday last - a large board,
      with me full-length in a pose reminisce of Modiglionis'
      Petit Payson. Indeed the whole thing is rather curved &
