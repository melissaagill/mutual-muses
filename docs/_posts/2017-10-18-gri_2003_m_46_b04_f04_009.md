      so following the 14th I am quite free so we could be completely together without
      the problem of separating while I go to town or of doubling expenses & both
      going. Dear heart, you know I adore you & long for you to be here but I think
      it would be best if you come Saturday 14th or Sunday 15th when some money &
      all the time will be ours entirely. However - let me know what you think. I
