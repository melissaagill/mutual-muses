      2  and I think that it is much
      improved.  I did some work on the
      Savage but I don't see to get it
      right!  I am hoping that Tiny
      will sit on Saturday morning -
      or perhaps Wednesday - She will
      be at Little Hampton on Thursday
      and Friday.
      I say, can't owls be included
      somehow among the cats, lions, and
      an elephant?
      To-day, or rather this morning
      was wonderfully sunny and pleasent
      and Tiny and I went to Plot
      Foot-Paths - she is doing it for the
      survey.  We went down by the
      Church unto the Valley - your favorite
      walk.  I very much enjoyed it.
      I have just made some more
      Marmalade - I don't know why
      it just wouldn't set - I blame my
      Nle store - I believe the currant
      thicknated and so doesn't boil
      the marmalade stronly enough.

      2    and I think that it is much
      improved.  I did some work on the
      Savage but I don't see to get it
      right!  I am hoping that Tiny
      will sit on Saturday morning--
      or perhaps Wednesday--she will
      be at Little Hampton on Thursday
      and Friday.
      I say, can't owls be included
      somehow among cats, lions and
      an elephant?
      Today, or rather this morning,
      was wonderfully sunny and pleasant
      and Tiny and I went to plot
      foot-paths.  She is doing it for the
      survey.  We went down by the
      church into the valley--your favorite
      walk.  I very much enjoyed it.
      I have just made some more
      marmalade.  I don't know why it just wouldn't set.  I blame my
      vile store.  I believe the Currant
      Hucknated and so doesn't boil
      the marmalade strongly enough.
