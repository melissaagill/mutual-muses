      I have nearly finished my Elegy and I am

      approve of it: I do think my decision to [unclear][/unclear]
      my style is beginning to bear fruit - tho' the poetic
      interim was, perhaps, dull & uncharacteristic.

      Thank you, yes, my Matisse lecture was a
      success on Friday and so, I think, were the
      other public ones. I discussed Le Rene for 35
      minutes and think I understand it better now.

      I have to come to town (in the show) for an unexpected extra
      lecture today, Sunday (so I am somthing of a
      Rector Lion) - Also I have one
      next Sunday, too, both at the T.G.

      I will write more this evening,
      I love & adore you - get better my love,
      I love you

      I have nearly finished my elegy and am working on a poem - rather like a sequel to the poem I sent you. I am so pleased that you approve of it: I do think my decision to [unclear]prune[/unclear] my style is beginning to bear fruit, tho' the poetic interim was, perhaps, dull & uncharacteristic.

      Thank you, yes, my Matisse lecture was a success on Friday and so, I think, were the other public ones. I discussed Le Reve for 35 minutes and think I understand it better now.

      I have to come to town (in the snow) for an unexpected extra lecture today Sunday (so I am something of a [unclear]Rectes[/unclear] lion) - Also I have one next Sunday, too, both at the T.G.

      I will write more this evening.
      I love & adore you - get better my love,
      I love you
      Lawrence
