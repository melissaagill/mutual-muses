      was late and poor Mrs. Owers in bed
      with librositics and so we did not
      finish washing up to 3 o'clock.  I
      have not painted today but
      have brought everything down and
      have been looking at the picture--

    clean_transcription: 14-3-52<br/>Pett<br/>Dearest Lawrence,<br/>Thank you for
      your letter card,<br/>as you see all my pens have broken<br/>down!  Very soon
      I shall be obliged<br/>to buy one!  You will have had one<br/>letter by now
      which will have answered<br/>most of your questions!  I had hoped<br/>to write
      this to catch the 430<br/>post but I seemed to have a spate<br/>of odd jobs
      and shopping and so<br/>I did not have time.  Also lunch<br/>was late and poor
      Mrs. Owers in bed<br/>with librositics and so we did not<br/>finish washing
      up to 3 o'clock.  I<br/>have not painted today but<br/>have brought everything
      down and<br/>have been looking at the picture--<br/>Clifford is kindly bringing
      in some<br/>grapes tonight so that I hope
