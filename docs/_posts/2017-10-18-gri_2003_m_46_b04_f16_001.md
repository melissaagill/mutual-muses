      1-4-15  Pett Dearest Lawrence,
      I hope your lunch was adequate
      and did not "let you down" so that
      you were sufficiently well nourished
      to give a good lecture; and
      that Charles gave you a splendid
      dinner - I shall look foreward
      to hearing the remarks of interest
      of the doctor - I hope Poyser
      is not present - what a ghastly
      man he is.
      I am so glad that you come
      it was lovely to see you.  I do
      hope you were not tired by short
      nights.  We all enjoyed your visit
      so much - "Wacko" is going to
      write to you, I think and send
      you a photo - she's quite smitten!
      You will be pleased to hear
      (I may see a place that needs
      a touch or too) I am pleased
      with it. Wacko is going to sit
      on Tuesday morning in my
