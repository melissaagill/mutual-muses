      3 from well. So there will be no one
      to go with Mejah while Tiny
      is talking to the traffic manager.
      The garden is terribly dry, I think
      most of the tomatoes will survive -
      I have been pouring water over
      them and the Indian corn - and
      some on the French beans, but
      I think they are done for - oh
      dear! Anyway there are two little
      marrows - Tiny-! But I think
      all the gold fish have died - I
      must see the man about it, "Uncle
      Ted" said the scum was too thick!
      By the way couldn't you write
      something on the Tate exhibition in
      Gainsborough or is it too late!
      Perhaps something on Expressionism?
      As well as "The Listener" I
      read some thene in the train and en-
      joyed it very much -
