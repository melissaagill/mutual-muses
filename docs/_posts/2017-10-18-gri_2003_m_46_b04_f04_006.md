      2 IV 1951
      Dearest Sylvia,
      Today I have been busy - preparing future
      lectures at the N.G. and sending off S E A
      letters in the hope of raising the circulation.
      This evening I am going to see Orphee so
      that I can complete the article &, since I
      shall be in Hampstead, have a drink with
      Madeleine before returning home.
      Miss [unclear]Rich's[/unclear] Easter holiday
      was in a cottage
      in Rye attached to Paul Nash's house. She
      spent her next reading Henry James she
      tells me. She seemed friendly and, in her re-
      served way, quite gay. It must be her holi-
      day - it can't be spring. Or have you had
      better weather than that which batters Hetty's
      hats, makes Dandy's mane straight. & causes
      Yawalla to skid about when he runs.
      This note is simply to say that I adore you &
      that you must not think I forget you, even
      for a minute. I love you dearest Sylvia
       will write again tomorrow morning.
      I love you
      Lawrence

      Today I have been busy - preparing future
      lectures at the N.G. and sending off S.E.A.
      letters in the hope of raising the circulation.
      This evening I am going to see Orphee so

      shall be in Hampstead, have a drink with
      Madeleine before returning home.
      Miss Chick's Easter holiday was in a cottage
      - Rye attached to Dave Nark's house. She
      spent her rest reading Menn, James she
      tells me. She seemed friendly and, in her re-
      pressed way, quite gay. It must be her holi-
      day - it can't be Spring. Oh have you had
      better weather than that which bothers Hetty's
      rats, makes Dandy's mane straight, & courses
      Yawalla to skid about when he runs.
      This note is simply to say that I adore you &
      that you must not think I will forget you, even
      for a minute. I love you dearest Sylvia
      & will write again tomorrow morning.

      SQUARE LONDON WC1<br/><br/>2. 4. 1951<br/>Dearest Sylvia,<br/>Today I have been
      busy - preparing future lectures at the N.G. and sending off SEA letters in
      the hope of raising the circulation. This evening I am going to see Onglee so
      that I can complete the article and, since I shall be in Hampstead, have a drink
      with Madeleine before returning home.<br/>Mrs. Chicks Eartes holiday was in
      a cottage in Rye attached to Dave Nash's house. She spent her rest reading Henry
      James she tells me. She seemed friendly and, in her repressed way, quite gay.
      It must be her holiday - it can't be spring. On have you had better weather
      than that which batters Hetty's rats, makes Dandy;s mane straight and causes
      Yawalla to skid about when he runs.<br/>This note is simply to say that I adore
      you and that you must not think I forget you, even for a minute. I love you
      dearest Sylvia and I will write again tomorrow morning. <br/>I love you<br/>Lawrence
