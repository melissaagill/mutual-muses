      Dipping the velvet mask with silver beaks
      What foreign words do birds write on the air

      The occasion is a summer storm with spectacular lightning. I am

      Peter's conversation when I get home, to finish poems. I am

      is a great financial advantage.
      I have rather less than 4,000 francs left. I am transferring
      some money from Lewisham to Paris which is for Peter. He gave
      me a cheque which I sent to my bank requesting them to transfer
      the amount to me here. This is, in fact, legal so do not feel
      alarm. As a result of the transaction I shall get a further

      see you as soon as possible. So on one of those days I shall

      Ripping the velvet mask with silver beaks
      What foreign words do birds write on the air
      Non-figurative as a burning icon

      The occasion is a summer storm with spectacular lightning.  I am
      working on other poems in the idiom and on some lyrics more in
      my usual style.  It is difficult with galleries all days &, after,
      Peter's conversation when I get home, to finish poems.  I am
      still at his apartment, however, and look like staying here which
      is to great financial advantage.
      I have rather less than 4,000 francs left.  I am transferring
      some money from Lewiston to Paris which for Peter.  he gave
      me a cheque which I sent to my bank requesting them to transfer
      the amount to me here.  This is, in fact, legal so do not feel
      alarm.  As a result of my transaction I shall get a further
      3,000 francs.  In any case, however, I shall not stay later
      than Friday or Saturday - because I must see you again &
      see you as soon as possible.  So on one those days I shall
      come to Pett, if I may.  I will write or, if necessary, cable you
      which day and the approximate time.
      I have a slight sore throat (from climate, not shouting[unclear][/unclear]) from the 14th July and really that is
      my strongest memory of it.  I found the whole fete rather unat-
      tractive, despite my expectations.  I will try & explain when we
      meet its failure to delight me - despite pleasant details.
      Oh Sylvia, my love, my Minerva, my rose
      I love love love you
