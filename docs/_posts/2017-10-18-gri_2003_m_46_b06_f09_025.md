      17 September
      Thank you so much for your painting of roses. It is beautiful. I have
      made it lean upon the bookcase and it is really stunning. It is lovely
      as an image, as a painting, and as a gift. It gives me a birthday feeling
      at once.
      It was sweet of you to send me a pound. Thank you for so thoughtful
      a gesture. With it I shall buy a white shirt I have seen, with a button
      down collar. Tracey's (Lewisham) is the place
      where I saw it. Only Â£1. 2s. 10d. (As you know,
      I need a white shirt.)
      I should try not to bother about M's reaction too much, though I sup-
      pose he will be mad, as you say. After all you were worried before
      telling Georgie : surely you decided that it was worth pos-
      sible consequences with M before seeing Georgie.
      So glad to hear about South. Good, good for you. As you say, Sutton
      is near Banstead. I hope the other commission came off, too,
      though, as you say, Diana's will only be nominal in price.
      I have not yet collected your Blackheath watercolour. I'll let it before
      you come, however. (That's ONE question answered).
      The lecture is Rossetti & Burne-Jones today and as usual I have
      heaps of work to do on it. So I must go to town. This evening I
      am going to Wimbledon.
      All my love. I adore you
      Lawrence
      P.S. I have the catalogue of the Antonello exhibition which I
      am longing to show you.

      17 September
      Thank you so much for your painting of roses. I have made it lean up on the bookcase and it is really stunning. It is lovely as an image, as a painting, and as a gift. It gives me a birthday feeling at once.
      It was sweet of you to send me a pound. Thank you for so thoughtful a gesture. With it I shall buy a white shirt I have seen, with a button down collar. Tracey's (Lewisham) is the place where I saw it. Only 1 2s 11d. (as you know, I need a white shirt).
      I should try not to bother about M's reaction too much, though I suppose he will be mad, as you say. After all you were worried before telling Georgie: surely you decided that it was worth possible consequences with M before seeing Georgie.
      So glad to hear about South. Good, good for you. As you say, Sutton is near Banstead. I hope the other commissions come off, too, though as you say, Diana's will only be nominal in price.
      I have not yet collected your Blackheath watercolor. I'll let it before you come, however. (That's ONE question answered).
      The lecture is Barrett's & Burne-Jones today and as usual I have heaps of work to do on it. So I  must go to town. This evening I am going to Wimbledon.
      All my love
      I adore you
      Lawrence
      P.S. I have the catalogue of the Antonello exhibition which I am longing to show you.
