      Dearest Lawrence,

      Thank you so much for sending the things - I am sorry to be such a nuisance. The brush will be marvellously useful - I want to try to get an immense number of jobs done before I come to town - as the 20th is very near Christmas. I think I shall come up Saturday the 13th in the afternoon - I will let you know - if that is convenient - otherwise Monday as Sunday is so difficult. I will try to arrange to see my aunt for lunch and tea at the Late Gallery on Tuesday! I would like to hear your  lecture.

      Yes, the play was the one about the [unclear]dention[/unclear].

    clean_transcription: Poetry Lodge               5.12.52<br/>Dearest Lawrence,<br/><br/>Thank
      you so much for sending the things- I am sorry to be such a nuisance. The brush
      will be marvellously useful- I want to try to get an immense number of jobs
      done before I come to town- as the 20th is very near Christmas. I think I shall
      come up on saturday 18th in the Afternoon- I will let you know- if that is convenient-
      otherwise Monday, as Sunday is so difficult. I wil try to arrange to see my
      aunt for lunch or tea at the Tate Gallery on Thursday! I would like to hear
      your lecture.<br/>       Yes, the play was the one about the dentist.<br/>       I
      am very pleased with the dressing table- I have furnished
