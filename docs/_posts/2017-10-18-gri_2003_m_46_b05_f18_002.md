      2
      off one's painting in favour of some urgent domestic task or social duty unless one is quite certain that one's work is important - preferably to the community, or at least to one'self.
      I don't know if I mentioned it but I did read the Thomas Mann article which I thought extremely good - I haven't read all of the Isadora Duncan yet. It struck me as I walked home from the beach on Wednesday that my mother and Mildred Molcatta were very much influenced by I.D. and even Grandma told me the dramatic story of her death. As a child I believe I had a great talent for dancing - or so my elders said and I loved to dance in such a way, as the music dictated. I remember once Mother go me to dance so at vegetarian musical evening, at Notting Hill Gate - I think I was about 5!

      2 off one's painting in favour of some urgent domestic task or social duty unless one is quite certain that one's work is important - preferably to the community,or at least to one'self.
      I don't know if I mentioned it but I did read the Thomas Mann article which I thought extremely good. I haven't read all the Isadora Ducan yet. It struck me as I walked home from the beach on Wednesday that my other and Mildred Molcatta were very much influenced by I.D. and story of her death. as a child I believe I had a great talent for dancing - or so my elders said and I loved to dance in such a way, as the music dictated. I remember once mother got me to dance so at vegetarian musical evening at  Notting hill gate. I think I was about 5!
