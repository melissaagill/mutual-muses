      so much for your long letters. I'm afraid by now you\nwill have received my
      bad news about Birmingham. I have not\nheard from Leeds and I tend to think
      that means I have not got\nonto the short list  even: if I were being considered
      I believe\nI would have heard by now. Unsuccessful candidates are always \nthe
      last to hear.\n\nYes, I agree with your list of 'What's On': I want to see all\nthe
      things you mention. I have not been to Lansburry or Batter-\nsea myself. You
      ask me to let you know what day you should go\nand see Muriel. I don't know:
      any time. I am lecturing on\n4th, 6th, 11th, 13th, 18th, 20th, 25th, 27th at
      the Tate. On\nWednesdays I shall be at Banstead. I will let you know when they
      start, latish in September, I think.\n\nI am dying to see you again. It is so
      long since we were to-\ngether. I feel as anxious and solitary as ever in our
      first\nyear when we were apart. Oh, dearest love, I adore you. I\ncannot think
      how I shall wait for another two weeks or so with-\nout seeing you.\n\nThat
      is good news about Desiree's portrait- how nice of Clifford\nand how nice for
      Desiree. To say nothing of your pleasure in\nso congenial a commission. I am
      sure she will be willing to\npose for Persephone and I do think that you have
      made a very\ninteresting piece of â€˜casting'. You will do for Persephone what\nyou
      have done for the Flight, beguiling the myth into new forms. \n\nYou are quite
      right about Horton who is, in non-popular directions,\nrather rationalistic.
      In fact the editor of Athene cut out one\nor two fines and highers as it was.
      He also thinks in terms of \ncliches about abstraction: retreat from reality,
      and all that.\n\nDo ask your mother-in-law about producing Virginia Dent though
      I\nam doubtful of her reaction when she reads it. I think your idea\nof sending
      it to French kindly met but somewhat overhopeful. It\nis rather like submitting
      a Matte to the National Portrait Gallery.\nIt is possible the play might be
      staged at John McHales's sometime-\nperhaps at a party. I am glad Clifford liked
      it.\n\nIf Clifford was knocked down twice by the tide whatever happened\nto
      you and Desiree? Still the fact you are able to write allays\nmy fears. What

      means good for the film-star type!\nShe is, as you say, nice and quite dotty.

      Blackheath
      Friday
      Dearest Sylvia,
      Thank you so much for your long letters.  I'm afraid by now you will have received my bad news about Birmingham.  I have not heard from Leeds and I tend to think that means I have not got onto the short list even: if I were being considered I believe I would have heard by now.  Unsuccessful candidates are always the last to hear.

      Yes, I agree with your list of 'What's On': I want to see all the things you mention.  I have not been to Lansbury or Battersea myself.  You ask me to let you know what day you should go and see Muriel.  I don't know:  any time.  I am lecturing on 4th, 6th,11th, 13th, 18th, 20th, 25th, 27th at the Tate.  On Wednesdays I shall be at Banstead.  I will let you know when they start, latish in September, I think.

      I am dying to see you again.  It is so long since we were together.  I feel as anxious and solitary as ever in our first year when we were apart.  Oh, dearest love, I adore you.  I cannot think how I shall wait for another two weeks or so without seeing you.

      That is good news about Desiree's portrait - how nice of Clifford and how nice for Desiree.  To say nothing of your pleasure in so congenial a commission.  I am sure she will be willing to pose for Persephone and I do think that you have made a very interesting piece of 'casting'.  You will do for Persephone what you have done for the Flight, beguiling the myth into new forms.

      You are quite right about Horton who is, in non-popular directions, rather rationalistic.  In fact the editor of Athene cut out one or two fines and highers as it was.  He also thinks in terms of cliches about abstraction:  retreat from reality, and all that.

      Do ask your mother-in-law about producing Virginia Dent though I am doubtful of her reaction when she reads it.  I think your idea of sending it to French kindly met but somewhat overhopeful.  It is rather like submitting a Matta to the National Portrait Gallery.  It is possible the play might be staged at John McHale's sometime - perhaps at a party.  I am glad Clifford liked it.

      If Clifford was knocked down twice by the tide whatever happened to you and Desiree?  Still the fact you are able to write allays my fears.  What a sea that must have been.  I bet Clifford was furious.

      What a shock to have Mary Oppenheim visit you.  What an odd opinion of hers that it was a good thing Charles had not married a film-star type.  I suppose she means good for the film-star type!  She is, as you say, nice and quite dotty.  I am glad she likes your painting:  I think your livliness and your sense of colour would
