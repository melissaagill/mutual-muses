      Dearest Lawrence,
      I hope the discussion
      was amusing, I think it
      was about to begin as I
      travelled home from my lecture.
      I got t the White Hart eventually
      at 7:45 and Mrs. Sutter
      brought me home.  I started
      off badly by missing the (;30
      bus however I got two lifts
      in to Hastings the last one
      by Michael Watson--very dash-
      ing!  I then did some more
      to my lecture in the library
      and finally in the train.
      When I reached the very
      pleasant house where I was
      to lunch, and the door was
      opened my heart failed me
      for obviously the house was
