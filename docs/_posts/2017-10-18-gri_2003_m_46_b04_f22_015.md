      Doris - oh whom she is ery fond. Tiny is in a very depressed state, I am rather worried. I fear the summer has been much too much for her. I shall do my best to make things as easy for her as possible.
      By the way, what about the book you are doing with Parsons? How is it going? and what about Hogarts?
      I saw in Art News there are various exhibitions next month - which ones shall I send it for? I thought I might try the portraits again whith that one of Erica? and wacko's perhaps? what do you think about the London Group?
      I shall now go and paint from the other side of the house - the terrace with the new past the wall and ones the Rose Garden for the back of my [unclear]mewal[/unclear]. I love you, dearest Lawrence
      I hope that you have a good week.
      I love you
      Sylvia
