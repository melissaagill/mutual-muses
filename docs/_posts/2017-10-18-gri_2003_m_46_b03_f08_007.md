                     MONDAY

      Dearest Sylvia -
           I thought of you all over the week-end, struggling
      with the greenwoods. I hope you can release now.
      I must apologize for writing no more than this
      hasty note now but I am preparing my Tuesday
      morning lecture and still have good deal to
      do, and must return shortly to the gallery.
           My father has agreed to let me have a cheque
      for 50, which is, I think, very kind indeed. I feel
      very glad and grateful about this. They have
      given me chocolate, thinned meat, & butter from
      France, and 2 tiny bottles of liqueur - Benedic-
      tine & cherry brandy, which we shall drink when
      you come.
          I love you and think of you so strongly, while
      I work in the day, and before I sleep at night. I
      have written a good deal of another 100 line poem,
      which I will send  you soon - my dazzling Muse -
      how you inspire me to write!
           I hope you can paint this week - I love you.
      I will write more fully tomorrow.

                               I love you
                                          Dandy

      I thought of you all over this week-end, struggling with the Greenwoods.  I hope you can release now. I must apologise for writing no more than this hasty note now but I am preparing my Tuesday morning lecture and still have a good deal to do, and must return shortly to the gallery.
      My father has agreed to let me have a cheque for £50, which is, I think, very kind indeed. I feel very glad and grateful about this. They have given me chocolate, tinned meat, & bottles from France, and 2 tiny bottles of liqueur - benedictine and cherry brandy, which we shall drink when you come.

      Monday
      Dearest Sylvia -
      I thought of you all over the week-end, struggling
      with the [unclear]greenwoods[/unclear]. I hope you can relax now.
      I must apologise for writing no more than this
      nasty note now but I am preparing my Tuesday
      morning lecture and still have a good deal to
      do, and must return shortly to the gallery.
      My father has agreed to let me [unclear][/unclear]
      for 50, which is, I think, very kind indeed. I feel
      very glad and grateful about this.  They have
      given me chocolate, tinner meat, & butter from
      France and 2 tiny bottles of liqueur - benedic-
      tine & cherry brandy, which we shall drink when
      you come.
      I love you and think of you so strongly, while
      I work in the day, and before I sleep at night. I
      have written a good deal of another 100 line poem,
      which I will send you soon. my dazzling muse - how you inspire me to write!
      I hope you can paint this week - I love you
      & will write you fully tomorrow
      I love you
      Dandy
