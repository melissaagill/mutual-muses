      3. I am still in bed but hope to get up this afternoon. I was really rather worried about myself - I thought I was going to have Bronchitis but hot rum and the inhaler dispersed the trouble - I had a band of discomfort around and above my waist and a nasty cough also my head felt fright-fully uncomfortable - I really couldn't do anything for long but play patience and as everything seemed to me equally futile I thought I might as well! However I feel very cheerful and full of ideas to-day- and I have written a book in my head which I will write down and send to you when I have time!
         Oh! the reporter liked my work very much and said the blurb was excellent, he's not mentioning my married name - Tiny interviewed him - as she told him, on my instructions - that husbands don't like to be "The husband of the painter" especially when they paint themselves! That's the line I shall stick to. I shall instruct Chase similarly. I am writing to him today
