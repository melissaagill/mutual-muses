      It is a great nuisance that Maxwell should choose to adopt this silly attitude - out of spite doubtless, because we would not extend his tenancy or supply a reference without inspecting the flat.

      As to his sentence about my 'discussing' the matter of the receipts; this is deliberately lifted out of the context of my request to include this with the other matters that I suggested we should discuss personally and conveniently when I visited the flat. There has been no question of our refusing these receipts.

      So sorry to bother you with this tiresome nonsense. Lovely weather at last, but I am working on the self portrait and resisting the temptation to go out.

      Ought I to reply to Match in writing? Do get in touch with them if convenient, and let me know what to do, if I can help.

      The sewing machine is to be collected tomorrow!

      With my dearest love to you, darling [unclear][/unclear] your own Michael

    clean_transcription: It is a great nuisance that Maxwell should<br/>choose to
      adopt this silly attitude - out of spite<br/>doubtless, because we would not
      extend his<br/>tenancy or supply a reference without<br/>inspecting the flat.<br/>As
      to his sentence about my 'discussing' the<br/>matter of the receipts; this is
      deliberately<br/>lifted out of the context of my request to include<br/>this
      with the other matters that I suggested<br/>we should discuss personally and
      conveniently <br/>when I visited the flat. There has been no<br/>question of
      our refusing these receipts.<br/>So sorry to bother you with this tiresome <br/>nonsense.
