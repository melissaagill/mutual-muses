'No Gallivanting here', he said ruefully.  Soon I will send you a drawing of the clock tower - pure phantasy my dear.

      I have written about 500 words on Beckett's Hogarth (am I not quick?) and am making a start on the other book this morning.

      I do not know about the personal relations of the librarians here (as I did at Shepherd's Bush) but their behaviour confirms my belief that they are, as a social type, stupid, mannerless, slow-in-response, philistine, and, generally, beneath contempt though I am not always above irritation.

      I do hope you are well now - I appear to be so I expect you will be, also, for although we reacted at different speeds our symptoms point to [unclear]Kings[/unclear] x refreshments.

      I love you, my dearest, so much - I think of you all the time and treasure every thought of you.  Your locket is with me now

      I love you
      Lawrence
