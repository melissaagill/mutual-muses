      27 X 52

      Dearest Sylvia

      Did I tell you that the sash cord of the front window was broken? The upper frame was hanging by, almost, a thread. I spoke to Mrs Morrison and Blow & Co.'s men came today: I anticipated them being here all day but they have done it all in half an hour. I invited [unclear]Pasmore[/unclear] to 5.00 o'clock tea because of them - I could have made it earlier. I shall give him Welsh Ratebit, Bread & butter, orange flavoured doc. biscuits, & pomegranate! The last is optional.

      Yes I agree one ought to see [unclear]Brangwyn[/unclear] tho' Ronald Alley says its worse than I think. & You know what I think.

      That is excellent news about Mrs Clark: good for here. And how good for your bank account.  I hope you feel more secure about things now.

      The decanter in its new frame must be charming. As you say - why didn't you do it before? I am impatient to see it.

      Who is [unclear]Barden[/unclear] going to redecorate - the Rectory or the church you are painting? It isn't clear.

      So glad about Manhood.

      Yes I will bring my cord-coat to Pett, & the picture frames from behind the bath.

      I shall do some Steer and some Pasmore article during the afternoon until the latter comes.

      I am dying to see you, my love.

      I adore you
      Lawrence

      Dearest Sylvia
      Did I tell you that the sash cord of the front window was broken? The upper frame was hanging by, almost, a thread. I spoke to Mrs Harrison and Blow & Co.'s men came today: I anticipated them being here all day but they have done it all in half an hour. I invited Pasmore to 5.00 o'clock tea because of them - I could have made it earlier. I shall give him Welsh Rarebit, bread and butter, orange flavoured choc. biscuits, & pomegranate! The last is optional.
      Yes I agree one ought to see Brangwyn tho' Ronald Alley says its worse than I think, & you know what I think.
      That is excellent news about Mrs Clark: good for her. And how good for your bank account. I hope you feel more secure about things now.
      The decanter in its new frame must be charming. As you say- why didn't you do it before? I am impatient to see it.
      Who is Barden going to redecorate - the Rectory or the church you are painting? It isn't clear.
      So glad about Manhood.
      Yes I will bring my cord-coat to Pett,, & the picture frames from behind the bath.
      I shall do some Steer and some Pasmore article during the afternoon until the latter comes.
      I am dying to see you, my love.
      adore you
      Lawrence
