      in her skirt and her feet. I have
      drawn out the child and shall

      can to-day.
      I love you, my darling, and am

      his shirt which is yellow check! Maury is finished but for some touches in her skirt and her feet. I have drawn out the child and shall trace him in to-night - I am pleased with the drawing. I have only worked about 2 hours so far to-day but I hope to do at least another two now, and shall do a full day tomorrow - it was the washing! I may do a water colour at the "white flash" tomorrow if there are and parts of the landscape that seem amorphous. I shall finish all I can today.

      I love you, my darling, and am always thinking of you - I miss you so much - I find it so much easier to paint when you are there and even Yawolla cannot make up for my Dandylion - delightful though he be, and helpful.

      I hope you will be comfortable and enjoy your travels - good luck!

      I love you
      Sylvia
