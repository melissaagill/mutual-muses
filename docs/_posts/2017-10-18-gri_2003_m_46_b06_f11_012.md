      Blackheath
      Thursday 12th XI
      Dearest Sylvia
      Thank you for your letter. I quite understand about Foster & Foster's. South phoned them, I think. But I expect that you will have heard by now. I look forward to hearing the results of his intervention.
      I note that you are coming to town on Monday. I will do my best to meet you then. I will tell you in my  next letter. I have some arrangements for that day but I think I can postpone them. In fact I am sure of it. We can try some of the Greenwich & Lewisham agencies together.
      The Language of the Arts prospectus is a riot. Elevated chaos is rife, wouldn't you say? In a macabre way it would be amusing to attend. I wonder what the one on Popular Culture (in the new year) will be like: even more weird I expect for there is no tradition at all to even point tutors in the right direction.
      I am glad you have been to [unclear] Cawder [/unclear] Castle again.
      What good news, too, that you are working on the sofa cover. Sweet good industrious cat!
      Barnstead went very well last night-after the break.
      Today I have an exhibitions committee meeting. C.A.S. lecture at the TG, then an ICA lecture (Turnbull & another) at which I shall see Magda & John.
      I have no other news except that I am longing to see you on  Monday. Sleep well my love.
      Love you
      Lawrence

      Thursday 12th
      Dearest Sylvia
      Thank you for your letter. I quite understand about Foster & Foster's.
      South phoned them, I think. But I expect that you will have heard
      by now. I look forward to hearing the results of his intervention.

      I note that you are coming to town on Monday. I will do my best
      to meet you then. I will tell you in my next letter. I have some
      arrangements for that day but I think I can postpone them. In
      fact I am sure of it. We can try some of the [unclear][/unclear]Greenwich[unclear][/unclear] & Lewis -
      [unclear][/unclear]from[unclear][/unclear] [unclear][/unclear]agencies[unclear][/unclear] together.

      The Language of the Arts [unclear][/unclear]prospectus[unclear][/unclear] is a [unclear][/unclear] riot [unclear][/unclear]. [unclear][/unclear]Romantic[unclear][/unclear] chaos is
      rife, wouldn't you say? In a [unclear][/unclear]macabre[unclear][/unclear] way it would be amusing
      to attend. I wonder what the one on Popular Culture (in the new
      year) will be like: even more weird I expect for there is no
      tradition at all to even point tutors in the right direction.

      I am glad you have been to [unclear][/unclear] Camden[unclear][/unclear] Castle again.

      What good news, too, that you are working on the sofa [unclear][/unclear] cover[unclear][/unclear]. [unclear][/unclear] sweet[unclear][/unclear]
      good industrious cat!

      [unclear][/unclear]Bamstead[unclear][/unclear] went very well last night - after the [unclear][/unclear] break[unclear][/unclear].

      Today I have an exhibitions committee meeting. C.A.S. [unclear][/unclear] lecture[unclear][/unclear]
      at the TG, then an ICA lecture ([unclear][/unclear] Turnbull[unclear][/unclear] & [unclear][/unclear] orther[unclear][/unclear]) [unclear][/unclear]all [unclear][/unclear]which I
      [unclear][/unclear] shall[unclear][/unclear] see Magda & John.

      I have no other news except I am longing to see you on Monday.
      sleep well my love.
      love yo
      Lawrence
