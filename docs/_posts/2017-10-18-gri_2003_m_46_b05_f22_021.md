      3. Talking of Press publicity Tiny has talked to our reporter and he is going to give me a write up in February and wants a photo. I thought perhaps we could borrow a camera and [unclear]Lion[/unclear] would take a picture of Cat in her studio. I didn't say so to Tiny, but although delighted on one hand I felt some trepidation on the other! But I think I could keep out my married name and my exact place of residence it might be very useful- I will discuss it with you privately and will make some notes as to what to say.
      I am very interested in what you say of the "Psychic Close-up" I think it should be very useful and shows wonderful perception on your part.!
