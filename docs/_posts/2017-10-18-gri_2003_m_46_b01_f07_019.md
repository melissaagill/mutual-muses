      [16-8-48]

      Sunday: august  11 mansel road
      wimbledon

      Dearest Sylvia,

      Thank you for your long letter.  I wish that this could be as long in return but I am literally snatching a few moments from preparing my next lecture to write this.  I know you understand but, as your own ex-
      perience will appreciate, four lectures in eight days is a strain.

      Since you left Bologna early you probably missed my third letter there but please do not worry about it.  I am so happy that you have reached Venice after so long, and with Castelfranco readily available, also.  Fortunate creature.  I really am a blue Satyr now - blue with envy.  Or should I be green?  Blue is prettier I think.

      I imagine you crossing Canalette squares, gliding over Guardi lagoons, disappearing into Tintoretto-glowing interiors.

      The Pietro Da Cortona is enchanting; it is of a kind I have not seen before.  It is kind of you to send it to me; thank you, darling.

      Next door to the Pietro...  And a visit to Assisi.  All I can do is repeat mor-
      onically the magic names.
