I so wish you were still here.

      under the bed clothes........ ( how did you make yourself so flat ?)  I'm walking
      around the abominable 'drawing room' the dot of blood on your ear. I would go
      on for the length of this letter; how can one night leave such an elaborate
      impression ? I so wish you were still here. As I write I can hear two clocks
      ticking ; one goes urgently at great speed while the other, the grandfather
      you rewound is louder and stately. I feel as if Edgar Allen Poes raven will
      arrive soon. I feel very lonely in your absence. All I can do is write poems
      for you. Auden said once that the best love poetry was written to ideal figures
      but I no longer agree with this. You are both
