      SESTINA FOR SYLVIA:

      A silver comet stoops across the sky
      And vanishes into a woman's dream
      Illuminate the grottos of sleep,
      Colour the monochrome sea and flowers,
      Behind her eyelids and defensive arms.

      The stars make patterns, as of arms
      Arranged in trophies up the wall of sky:
      I lie the other side of sleep
      On the dark sub-conscious coast of Dream;
      My wish rides on falling star, a flower
      Whose petals cross the shadows like a lamp.

      O coral heroes, fishes bright as lamps
      Inhabiting a sea of sleep where arms
      Of divers grope for pearls in every flower,
      O when they surface in the morning sky
      Their hands divulge the perfume of a dream -
      Accurate, innocent souvenir of sleep.

      Under the waves of sheets you sleep:
      Beyond the naked circle of your arms
      Luminous vistas answer the lamp,
      Mutable premises of dream
      Where pearls can change to roses, and the sky
      Distends with pollen for the sleeping flower.

      Symbolic object of desire, the flower
      I dream of burgeons also in your sleep,
      So though we sleep apart, the sky
      An ice-burg in-between, reflects one lamp
      Which we divide in dreams - the phallic arm
      That reaches out to morning from the dream.

      Apollo's comet in the sea of dreams
      Was as imprudent coral flower
      And now the sunlight lies upon your arms
      Like petals of a rose, and sleep
      Falls from your sleepy head. The lamp
      Expands to fill the total dazzling sky.

      Souvenir of sleep, Apollo's lamp,
      Comet of flowers, blazons the future sky,
      When you will test my arms, my love, my dreams.
