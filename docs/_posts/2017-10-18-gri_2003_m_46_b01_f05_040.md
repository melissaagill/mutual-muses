      My dearest Sylvia

         You must not be worried about your big letter with the drawings as you seemed to be in the letter which followed it.  It was a lovely letter and though you seem to feel that it falls short of an ideal I did not feel it, as it lined up, totally, to my ideal.

         I agree with your discussion of love and Sartre and agree, too, with your in-vocation of Russell as an antidote to existentialism.  I imagine what some people dislike in Russell is the predom-inately critical approach of much of his work and they prefer the 'creative' non-sense of existentialism, alas!

         'Fall Guy': a fall guy is somebody who is 'framed' for a crime he doesn't commit.  Evidence is faked to point to an innocent party as the guilty one - O'Hara in The body from Shanghi, for example.  He was to take the Fall for somebody else, somebody, in fact, 'who had an edge'.

      You must not be worried about your big letter with the drawings as you seemed to be in the letter which followed it. It was a lovely letter and though you seem to feel that it falls short of an ideal I did not feel it, as it lived up, totally, to my ideal.

Evidence is faked to point to an innocent party as the [unclear]guilty[/unclear] one - O'Hara in The Lady From Shanghi, for example.
