      The other piece of news is that [unclear] M.
       [/unclear] tells me that the Whitechapel job is advertised - not in the Times or the Statesman, perhaps in the museums journal? Why don't you at least look at the advertisement - for there are not many free Courtauld students at present I believe.
      My painting is going nicely - i am working on the mantlepiece - I still have somewhat to do to both jugs and the pattern on the cup - Tiny is delighted with it.
      I don't think it has been quite so cold here as in town - but it's been pretty ghastly! And the wind is still bitter. My beans look excellent however, the peas are beginning to show as are the lettuces and in the house, my tomato plants. I put in the sweet corn yesterday.

    clean_transcription: 2. The other piece of news is that M. tells me that the Whitechapel
      job is advertized - not in the Times or the Statesman, perhaps in the museums
      journal? Why don't you at least look at the advertizement - for there are not
      many free courtauld students at present I believe.<br/>My painting is going
      nicely - I am working on the mantlepiece - I still have somewhat to do to both
      jugs and the pattern on the cup - Tiny is delighted with it.<br/>I don't think
      it has been quite so cold here as in town - but its been pretty guastly! and
      the wind is still bitter. My beans look excellent however, the peas are beginning
      to show as are the lettuces and in the house, my tomatoe plants. I put in the
      sweet corn yesterday.
