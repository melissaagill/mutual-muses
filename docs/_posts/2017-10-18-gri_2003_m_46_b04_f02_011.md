      send in.  What about The Priary? I should think that
      is one they would like.  Also I suggest the view
      of 109 Blackheath Park in the Wood Collection. I
      think that one of your latest watercolours of the
      Belrige Square interior would be worth sub-
      mitting, too.  That makes three which is perhaps
      one more than you can enter.  The last word is
      yours but I hope this may help you to sort out
      the ones to send in from so many successful and
      beautiful examples.
      I will make the adjustments to my article that
      Clifford suggests.  I am very pleased he likes it.
      When I ahve posted this letter I plan to invite some
      of the Victorian sonnet article: films, too, I ex-
      pect.
      I wonder if you have started yet in your water-
      color of the Wood's new possession.  It is so ex-
      citing to think of new paintings by you progressing,
      enriching your [unclear][/unclear], even as I sit and write
      this.  Miles away, across a rainy pattern of town
      and country, perhaps, a radient image is farming
      at this moment.
      Alas, there are some SEA letters to write so
      I suppose I better get down to them. This paper
      shows that your lion also has headed paper
      of a fine magerrional character: Sylvia Sleigh
      and S.E.A. it means: society for the Elevation
      of Animals ( but only lions & cats, and elepants -
      or one elephant).  Hetty loves your muff - &
      so does Dandy.
      I love you, my dearest one, I love you

    annotation_text: "send in. What about the Priory? I should think that is one they
      would like. Also I suggest the view of 109 Blackheath park in the Wood Collection.
      I think that one of your latest watercolours of the Belsize square interiors
      would be worth submitting, too. That makes three which is perhaps one more than
      you can enter. The last word is yours but I hope this may help you to sort out
      the ones to send in from so many successful and beautiful examples.\nI will
      make the adjustments to my article that Clifford suggests. I am very pleased
      he likes it. When I have posted this letter I plan to write some of the Victorian
      sonnet article: films, too, I expect.\nI wonder if you have started yet on your
      watercolour of the Wood's new possession. It is so exciting to think of new
      paintings by you progressing, enriching your oeuvre, even as I sit and write
      this. Miles away, across a rainy pattern of town and country, perhaps, a radiant
      image is forming at this moment.\nAlas, there are some SEA letters to write
      so I suppose I better get down to them. This paper shows that your lion also
      has headed paper of a fine professional character: Sylvia Sleigh and S.E.A.
      It means: Society for the Elevation of Animals (but only lions & cats, and elephants
      - or one elephant). Hetty loves your muff - and so does Dandy.\nI love you,
      my dearest one, I love you \nLawrence"
