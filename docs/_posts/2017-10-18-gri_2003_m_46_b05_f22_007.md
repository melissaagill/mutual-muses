      2. is that? I am so glad and I hope it is interesting and remunerative. Have you asked Charles to put you on London University?
      I showed Tiny the landscape you drew and read her your letter. (I hope that Lincoln is more beguiling!) Tiny shook her head, when I showed her your picture, in agreement. I adore Dandy's portrait. Isn't he handsome! I do love him.
      I remember vividly the book on versions of Pastoral and the stimulating chapter on double plots.
      I should, of course, be madly flattered if you had some slides made of my paintings! I think it costs about 2/6 or did. I'm so glad tha tyou feel so enthusiastic - not only because that is delightful in itself - but you will be able to empart you enthusiasm to others, and not be ashamed to be associated with me.

      2.  is that?  I am so glad and I
      hope it is interesting and remuner-
      ative.  Have you asked Charles
      to put you on London University?
         I showed Tiny the landscape
      you draw and read her your letter
      (I hope that Lincoln is more be-
      guiling!)  Tiny shook her head,
      when I showed her your picture,
      in agreement.  I adore Dandy's
      portrait.  Isn't he handsome!  I
      do love him.
         I should of course, be madly
      flattered if you had some slides
      made of my paintings!  I thinlk
      it costs about 2/6 or did.
      I'm so glad that you feel so enthis-
      iastic -- not only because that
      is delightful in itself -- but you
      will be able to empart your en-
      thusiasm to others, and not be
      ashamed to be associated
      with me.  I am so glad that
      you like[unclear] Cult[/unclear] End and the [unclear]Turnable[/unclear]
