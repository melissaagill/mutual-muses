      "good thing".  Thank you so
      much for letting me have the book.
      I hope Banstead goes well
      and you enjoy your tea with
      Pasmore.  I am going up
      to Miss Campbell.  I thought
      it was about time!  I am
      still working on my attic picture
      but except for a touch here and
      there have finished my still-life
      (the white one).
      What do you think Renuth
      Brown turned up yesterday
      they are going to adopt a baby
      apparently.  I didn't see
      him of course.
      I've no other news--am
      longing to see you.  I feel
      very depressed.  I shall
      feel better when I have been
      out I expect.
      I love you, dear Lion,
      I love you
      Sylvia
