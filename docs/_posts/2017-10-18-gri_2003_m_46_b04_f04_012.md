      Dearest Sylvia--
      The weather is vile again:  Yawalla is drenced to the jar
      and Dandy will not be able to put off for long going out in
      the rain (V and A, the Banstead va a Wimbledon ttha).
      I have entitled your review A Guide to Ferrarere Art--
      as you have used the word yourself.  I think that it has

      erpieces) as Tura, Cossa, Costa, and Crinelli.
      Your WIAC watercolors are back safely:  I've put
      the interior up and The Poet is on the lair.
      My lecture yesterday to children of all colors on painting as
      an International Language was very enjoyable:  I showed
      the two Internation gathie pieces, Velasquez and Do March
      (Int. realism), Claude and Constable:  I spent 1 hour and 1/4 on
      these six pictures.  I had prepared the lecture for late
      adolescents and was startled to see ten year olds but tey
      were charming and intelligent.
      Ehren Ginerg is lecturing early in May at the ICA on

      mormon I think it should be a marvellous talk, don't you.
      I hope that Ruth and you enjoyed your the yesterday and but
      your painting of Carol will progress satisfactory--I am

      4 iv 1951 Blackheath Dearest Sylvia -
      The weather is mild again: Yawalla is drenched to the fur
      and Dandy will not be able to put off for long going out in
      the rain (V and A, the Banstead via a WImbledon tea).

      I have entitled your review A guide to Ferrarere Art -
      as you have used the word yourself. I think that it has
      an undercurrent of disapproval. Incidentally I am
      interpreting Saturday's public lecture (Itailian mast-
      erpieces) as Tura, Cossa, Costa, and Crivelli.

      Your W.I.A.C. watercolors are back safely: Ive put
      the interior up & The Past in on the chair.
      My lecture yesterday to children of all colors on Painting as
      an Interrnational Gothic pieces, Velasques & Do Mooch
      (int. realism), Clause & Constable: I spent 1 hour & 1/4 on
      there six pictures. I had prepared the lecture for late adolescents & was started to see ten year olds but they
      were charming & intelligent.

      [unclear][/unclear] giving is lecturing early in May at the I.C.A. on
      Plychology of Abstract Art. Keeping in mind his smiling
      worman I think it should be a marvellous talk, don't you.

      I hope that Ruth & you enjoyed your tea yesterday & that
      your painting of Carol will progress satisfactory - I am
      sure it will. Even Hetty admits Carol is charming.

      I love you, muse and treasure, I love you
      Lawrence
