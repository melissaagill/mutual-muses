      Dearest Lawrence,

      I wonder with what baggage you travelled - for all your 'containers' 'including the shopping 'basket' appeared to be in the room! I shall bring the "cat with the [unclear]savage[/unclear]" when I come also the still life - I am very much looking forward to your seeing my picture and do hope that you will like it. I suppose the Kensington Gallery will let me bring [unclear]r[/unclear] paintings on Friday or Saturday as Monday would be impossible. I am glad that you like [unclear]Pray[/unclear] in the garden better.

      I am most excited to hear of your long poem - and longing to hear it.

      You seem very busy my darling, which is very gratifying, and I hope not too tiring

      Dearest Lawrence,,
           I wonder with what luggage you travelled - for all your 'containers' including the shopping 'basket' appeared to be in the room!  I shall bring the "Cat with the Savage" when I come also the still life.  I am very much looking forward to your seeing my big picture and do hope that you will like it.  I suppose the Kensington Gallery will let me bring in paintings on Friday or Saturday as Monday would be impossible.  I am glad that you like [unclear]Ping[/unclear] in the Garden better.
           I am most excited to hear of your long poem-and longing to hear it.
           You seem very busy my darling, which is very gratifying, and I hope not too tiring.
