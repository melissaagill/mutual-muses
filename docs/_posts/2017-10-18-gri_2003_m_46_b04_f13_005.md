      I just cannot believe that the WIAC can be so moronic. It is completely ridiculous and I do sympathize with what I am sure is your indignation at the myopic selection committee. By the way, neither Madeleine nor 'Eggs' Boyd were on it. I will collect the pictures before Wednesday 4th April, you may be sure.
      Paul, by the way, was amazed and impress-ed at your 'headless' self-portrait.
      How pleasant to hear that the [unclear]Fieldes[/unclear]are stimulating. I am so glad. I am sure they are an enormous improvement on the Savages.
      Today I am going to stay in and do some writing. It will do my cold good, which is on the way out, not to be exposed to more cold air than there is between the porch & the pillar box.
      I look forward with great pleasure to your next letter. I love you, my dearest Sylvia, and am relieved you are less worried. Perhaps I shall see you soon: I do hope so.
      I love you
      Lawrence
      Oh Sylvia I adore you: do not doubt me.
