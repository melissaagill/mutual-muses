      He took me to lunch at the 'Rotary Club' & we heard a short talk afterwards
      from a jolly mother-symbol from the local Reward home, telling all about her
      work. She was a fat Yorkshire Woman who believes that a kind word, a wash, &
      lots to eat, will bring the days back to a Christian way of life.<br/>From the
      window of my bedroom in the high street I have a view of the cathedral which
      I now propose to draw hastily as it is 5.30 and I must catch the post by six
      o'clock. This is the octagonminaretalong the N transept<br/>I think my lecture
      was well received. This evening I am having a drink with the Headmaster & some
      of the other masters. Then, after dinner, I must do a little work on Revais-
      decide more exactly about some of the individual compositions, &c. Then an early
      bed because I am tired. I wish you were here. I missed you constantly today
