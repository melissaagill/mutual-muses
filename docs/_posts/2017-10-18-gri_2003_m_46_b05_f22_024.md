      Dearest Lawrence,
      Do be careful about
      canvasing.  I think it "dis-
      qualifies"--and is Madelaine
      really tactful.  I don't really
      trust her as you know.  However
      you know the circumstances better
      than I do.  I think the job
      sounds very suitable, and very
      possible too--especially as you
      are in at the Tate and NG.
      I look forward to seeing
      the 19th journals you mention.
      I wonder how good Hilton is?
      He may be really quite important
      one never knows.
      I had a letter from the
      Sevenoulus WI--a very nice
      one--saying no lantern as
      they cannot black out--so
      I shall ask for a blackboard
      and so some diagrams

      about canvasing - I think it "dis-qualifies" - and is Madeline really tactful
      - I don't really trust her as you know. However you know the circumstances better
      than I do. I think the job sounds very suitable, and very possible too - especially
      as you are in at the Tate and N.G..<br/>I look forward to seeing the 19 journals
      you mention. I wonder how good Hilton is? he may be really important on never
      knows.<br/>I had a letter from the Sevenoaks W.I. - a very nice one saying no
      lantern as they cannot black out - so I shall ask of a blackboard and do some
      diagrams
