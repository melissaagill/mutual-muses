      WIMbledon 1967      11 MANSEL ROAD,
                                             WIMBLEDON, S.W. 19
      6th July

      Dearest Sylvia, my dear one -
      I hope that your pains left off quickly
      and that you are comfortable now.
      My poor rose - was the journey very
      difficult. I'm sure, though, your
      welcome at Pett must have cheered
      you.
      Wimbledon is not very nice but mem-
      ories of you stop me from being too
      worried by its drab character. My
      father was really very nice but
      mother wanted only to talk of the lame
      and the[unclear] bold[/unclear] and her Red + experience.

      Pablo you will be glad to hear is
      well. He has had a difficult time
      but is well now - very large and
      sleek and he seemed pleased to
      see me. We had a game in the
      garden where he ran about, then
      ran up the apple-tree and [unclear]tapped[/unclear]
