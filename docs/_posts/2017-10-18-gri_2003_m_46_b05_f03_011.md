    annotation_text: "Blackheath 14 III 1952\nDearest Sylvia\nThank you so much for
      your letter.You do seem to have been 'poorly' (as I'msure grandma used to say):
      I do hope that the Greenwoods' kindness (they do seem to have spoiled you, I'm
      glad to see) has made you feel better. It is good, too, that you stayed at Ditchling
      for 2 days. The rest, before returning to Pett (and, as it were, Littlehampton)
      will do you good.\nI'm glad John was pleasant in the train, and offered useful
      advice. I met Mira accidentally in the Tate yesterday and went to dinner with
      Richard and her. Frank Cordell rang up while I was there: it seems he has taken
      a Mews flat near Regents Park, presumably giving up Banstead. \nI have turned
      the page of your letter and see that the Greenwoods gave you whisky and hot
      baths. I am glad. Though I hated losing you a minute earlier than necessary
      it was better for you than the stuffy over-heated Tate. (I seem not to have
      a cold yet. That, by the way, is superstitiouse Dandy touching wood. It is a
      tree because the weather is so nice and Dandy is going for a walk in the open
      once he has written your letter.)\nIt was cold yesterday but this morning it
      is dazzling. It must be very nice at Pett just now. Are you, I wonder, working
      on your large still-life? Are you gossiping with Tiny? Busy (and gloved) in
      the garden? Athe Oak? I shall think of you at the village hall tomorrow. How
      I envy you that, on the hellos of the W.I. panto. too. Some cats have all the
      luck ...\nI have read the 1st 150 pp. of Moby Dick: 350 pp. to go. It is superb.

      seem to have spoiled you, I''m glad to see) has made<br/>you feel better. It
      is good, too, that you stayed at Ditchling for 2<br/>days. The rest, before
      returning to Pett (and, as it were, little-<br/>hampton) will do you good.<br/>I''m
      glad John was pleasant in the train, and offered useful advice.<br/>I met Mira

      Frank Cordell rang up while I was there: it seems he<br/>has taken a Mews flat
      near Regents Park, measurably giving up Banstead.<br/>I have turned the page
      of your letters and see that the greenwoods gave<br/>you whisky and hot baths.
      I am glad. Though I hated losing you<br/>a minute earlier than necessary it
      was better for you than the stuffy<br/>over-heated Tate. (I seem not to have
      a cold yet. <br/>That, by the way, is superstitious Dandy touching wood. It
      is a tree<br/>because the weather is so nice that Dandy is going for a walk
      in the <br/>open once he has written your letters.)<br/>It was cold yesterday
      but this morning it is dazzling. It must be<br/>very nice at Pett just now.
      Are you, I wonder, working on your <br/>large still - life? Are you gossiping
      with TIny? Busy (and gloved )<br/>in the garden? At the Oak? I shall think of
      you at the village<br/>hall tomorrow. How I envy you that, on the heels of the
      W.I. parts <br/>too. Some cats have all the luck...<br/>I have read the 1st
      150 pp. of Moby Dick: 350 more pp to go. It is<br/>superb. I cannot put it down.
      The new sarance has come: it <br/>includes a Kenneth Burke article ( you know
      how lion likes that!)<br/>I love you so much my darling. Do, do take care of

      Dearest Sylvia
      Thank you so much for your letters. You do seem to have been 'poorly'
      (as I am sure grandma used to say): I do hope that the Greenwoods'
      kindness (they do seem to have spoiled you, I'm glad to see) has made
      you feel better. It is good, too, that you stayed at Ditchling for 2
      days. The rest, before returning to Pett (and, as it were, Little-
      hampton) will do you good.
      I'm glad John was pleasant on the train, and offered useful advice.
      I met Mira accidentally in the Tate yesterday and went to dinner with
      Richard and her. Frank Cordell rang up while I was there: it seems he
      has taken a Mews flat near Regents Park, presumably giving up Barnstead.
      I have turned the page of your letter and see that the Greenwoods gave
      you whiskey and hot baths. I am glad. Though I hated losing you
      a minute earlier than necessary it was better for you than the stuffy
      over-heated Tate. (I seem not to have a cold yet.
      That, by the way, is superstitious Dandy touching wood. It is a tree
      because the weather is so nice that Dandy is going for a walk in the
      open once he has written your letter.)
      It was cold yesterday but this morning it is dazzling. It must be
      very nice at Pett just now. Are you, I wonder, working on your
      large Still-life? Are you gossiping with Tiny? Busy (and gloved)
      in the garden? At the Oak? I shall think of you at the village
      hall tomorrow. How I envy you that, on the heels of the W. I. panto,
