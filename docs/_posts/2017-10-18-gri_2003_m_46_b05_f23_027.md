      3    had belonged to her mother
      (she had my initials put on
      it) and in it was a very
      nice blue leather bag, a
      black fur shoulder cape,
      a brown fur tie, an
      amethyst necklace (natur-
      al statics) and a charming
      pink shetland shawl.  All
      of which I enjoy very much,
      and I think it was so
      nice of her to take all that
      trouble.  She had the hat
      box put in a small crate so
      that it should not be damaged.
      It is nice to have some att-
      ention paid to one isn't it?
      I hope you are well, my
      love, and keeping warm.  I
      shall work on my painting
      this afternoon, and wonder
      what you will do.  I do
      long to see you.  I love you.
