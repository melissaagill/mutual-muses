      in the Train
      8 Oct 1951

      Dearest Sylvia
         I am sorry you seem to write in a vacuum:  I will try to fill it with news and rumors as well as with declarations of love.
          I will write to [unclear]V. lines[/unclear] this evening about Lautrec.  (Incidentally the address I gave you is 'near Cambridge' - so that can be added after the name of the village.)
         Mary [unclear]Chanat[/unclear] wants me to lecture again at the T.G. in November.  And the interviews for the posts there will not take place until later in October or early November.  So I still have no news one way or the other.  I am waiting for details of a job at [unclear]Navid[/unclear] Art Gallery A Museum:  it was advertised in Arts News & Review.  By the way, Gainsborough has asked for suggestions for more articles on the [unclear]Brongine[/unclear]-Bosch matter.  Have you ideas for your lion?  For your ideas are always stimulating & fruitful.

         The train is very late and slow.  It took an hour and 10 minutes to get to Clemsford whereas on Friday I travelled to Clemsford in 60 minutes (see P.S.)

         The party on Saturday night started very nicely but ended abruptly half-an-hour after the last train had gone.  This made me extremely cross, indeed.  Madeleine, Mary, Paul & I went together.  I stayed the night with Paul which was very uncomfortable.  As a result I spent quite a lot of Sunday fast asleep.  However I am recovered & vigorous today.

         (Forgive my writing - more poor than ever - but I blame - as is fashionable at the moment - British Railways.)

         I am happy that you are happier and more confident.  There is a dear cat - I am pleased to hear it.  Oh how I long to see you - I love you so much.

         My father is having an operation soon.  He will be in hospital for 10 days to 2 weeks.  Piles is his complaint.  He can expect an uncomfortable but not dangerous time, I gather.

         The sun is out & fine and warm up here (near Colchester) so perhaps it is nice at Pett.  I do hope so.
          I love you love you
                   Lawrence

      P.S.  I had 400 teachers im the audience at Clemsford.  There was some trouble with the lantern & they laughed at the confusion of modern slides:  they were too ready to laugh at anything modern.  So when Klee's Trittering Machine came on the screen & they were solemn & quiet I hounded them until they laughed - telling them this was humerous.

      60 minutes (see P.S.)<br/><br/>   The party on Saturday night started very nicely
      but ended abruptly half-an-hour after the last train had gone.  This made me
      extremely cross, indeed.  Madeleine, Mary, Paul & I went together.  I stayed

      8 Oct 1951 In The Train
      Dearest Sylvia
      I am sorry you seem to write in a vacuum: I will try to fill it with news and answers as well as with declarations of love.
      I will write to [unclear]V[/unclear]. lines this evening about Lautrec. (Incidentally the address I gave you is 'near Cambridge' - so that can be added after the name of the village.)
      Mary [unclear]Clawat [/unclear] wants me to lecture again at the T.G. in November. And the interview for the posts there will not take place until later in October or early November. So I still have no news one way or the other. I am writing for details of a job at Warwick Art Gallery & Museum: it was advertised in Arts News & review. By the way, Gainsborough has asked for suggestions for more articles on the [unclear]Brongive[/unclear]-Bosch pattern. Have you any ideas for your lion? For your ideas are always stimulating & fruitful.
      The train is very late and slow. It took an hour and 20 minutes to get to Chelmsford (see P.S.) whereas on Friday I travelled to Chelmsford in 40 minutes.
      The party on Saturday night started very nicely but ended abruptly half-an-hour after the last train had gone. This made me extremely cross, indeed. Madeleine, Mary, Paul & I went together. I stayed the night with Paul which was very uncomfortable. As a result I spent quite a lot of Sunday fast asleep. However I am recovered & vigourous today.
      (Forgive my writing - more poor than ever - but blame - as is fashionable at the moment - British Railways.)
      I am happy that you are happier & more confident. There is a dear cat - I am pleased to hear it. Oh how I long to see you - I love you so much.
      My father is have an operation soon. He will be in hospital for 10 days to 2 weeks. Piles is his complaint. He can expect an uncomfortable but not dangerous time, I gather.
      The sun is out & fine and warm up here (near Colchester) so perhaps it is nice at Pett. I do hope so.
      I love love love you
      Lawrence
      PS I had 400 teachers in the audience at Chelmsford. There was some trouble with the lantern & they laughed at the confusion of modern slides: they were too ready to laugh at anything modern.
