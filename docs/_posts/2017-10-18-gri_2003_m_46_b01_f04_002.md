      My dearest Sylvia,

      The weather like everything else conspires to make me wish myself a Pett: the sun prickles my face. Pearls come. As your bus curved out of the station I glimpsed again the Hastings Poster. Last night I glanced through some poems by Max Jacob - and met your name, Sylvie.

      At present I have only the Marion watercolor because on my way home on Friday I stopped at Eric's flat and have them the other one to frame for me. I shall have it back early next week when it will go straight up on my wall - the only picture there. I shall have to go and visit him before then however because I am impatient to study it. On Friday I looked long an hard at 'Marion' and liked again the color and the sense of mass, of weight. And I like the slight twisting plane of the lips in contrast to the straighter lines of nose and eye-sockets. Oh you are so manifestly a painter in your strength and richness.

      Thinking about our talk on Friday and looking at your watercolor now I think I was right when I said you give an impression of weight, and consequently of growth and movement, and not a map of planes which, as sometimes in M8s less successful pieces, are really rather flimsy - despite their precision. But you react against the 20th century, post-Cezanne earnestness; mercifully, to this old reactionary. Take 'Marion'. Though she sits back in the chair she is not still, not static. Nor is it just the great swinging mass of hair that keeps her tense: the whole form is felt as capable of movement, of 'displacing' space to use a marine term which fits here. Vincent Lines, if he followed his own silly antithesis, would have to put you with Blake!

      I hope to hear new of a new work in your next letter.

      Christchurch, Spitalfiels, oh dear, is by Hawkmoor. Really his baroque has Victorian affiliations - in this case. I think it would wound alright on paper - but that's all.

      Mother's Red Cross Party van from about 6-30 to nearly 3. Violent games and tests of general knowledge and God remembers what else. I provided a scatalogical treasure hunt which, instead of disgusting, was a success. Lots of nice things to eat and drink and - what is more - lots left. This mitigates the ordeal.

    annotation_text: "9 v 1948\n11 Mansel Road\nWimbledon\nMy dearest Sylvia\nThe
      weather like everything else conspires to make\nme wish myself at Pett: the
      sun prickles my face.\nPearls come. As your bus curved out of the station\nI
      glimpsed again the Hastings Poster. Last night I\nglanced through some poems
      by Max Jacob - and met your name, Sylvie.\nAt present I have only the Marion
      watercolor be-\ncause on my way home on Friday I stopped at Eric's\nflat and
      gave him the other one to frame for me. I \nshall have it back early next week
      when it will go straight\nup on my wall - the only picture there. I shall have\nto
      go and visit him before then however because I am im-\npatient to study it.
      On Friday I looked long and hard\nat 'Marion' and liked again the color and
      the sense of \nmass, of weight. And I like the slight twisting plane\nof the
      lips in contrast to the straighter lines of nose\nand eye-sockets. Oh you are
      so manifestly a painter \nin your strengths and richness.\nThinking about our
      talk on Friday and looking at your\nwatercolor now I think I was right when
      I said you give\nan impression of weight, and consequently of growth and\nmovement,
      and not a map of planes which, as sometimes in\nM's less successful pieces,
      are really rather flimsy - \ndespite their precision. \nBut you react against\nthe
      20th century, post-Cezanne earnestness; mercifully,\nto this old reactionary.
      Take 'Marion'. Though she \nsits back in the chair she is not still, not static.\nNor
      is it just the great swinging mass of hair that keeps \nher tense: the whole
      form is felt as capable of movement, \nof 'displacing' space to use a marine
      term which fits here.\nVincent Lines, if he followed his own silly antithesis,
      \nwould have to put you with Blake!\nI hope to hear news of a new work in your
      next letter.\nChristchurch, Spitalfields, oh dear, is by Hawksmoor.\nReally
      his baroque has Victorian affiliations - in this\ncase. I think it would sound
      alright on paper - but \nthat's all.\nMother's Red Cross Party ran from about
      6-30 to nearly 3. Violent games and test of general knowledge and God\nremembers
      what else. I provided a scatological treasure\nhunt which, instead of disgusting,
      was a success. Lots\nof nice things to eat and drink and - what is more - lots
      left. This mitigates the ordeal."
