      Blackheath
      6 October
      Dearest Sylvia
      I am as busy as we anticipated - but so far I have kept work under control. The Renoir lecture was successful - 150 people. I am giving an extra one later.
      Wonderful news about Georgie - I am pleased. Also Georgie's advice sounded worth looking into. The Savages sound nice; give Beryl my love.
      I don't think I can find a surveyor this week, but I will start enquiries this week, so we'll have him very shortly.
      The only numbers I can find on a Blackheath bulb are these: 210-40W. Is that what you want? If not I'll try again.
      Love the sketch of Lambeth Castle, I well remember our visit. I hope the weather does not hold up your work on it.
      I enclose a copy of the last but one version of my review of M's sculpture show. I changed it a bit, but only a very little. This will give you a substantial impression I think of what will be printed.
      No more people at [unclear]Morpenden[/unclear] yet but I think that it should go on. Banstead tonight; I hope to get things straight there this evening.
      See you Sunday. I love and adore you. Love you Lawrence
      P.S. By all means come to the I.C.A. but I think you aught to go to the concert as the Greenwoods are being nice & it is so important to John. You can get a seat away from Michael's (if you tell Georgie). Really, if you can be careful about M, you should go. Love L.

      Blackheath
      6 October

      Dearest Sylvia:

      I am as busy as we anticipated - but so far I have kept work under
      control. The Renoir lecture was successful: ca 150 people. I am
      giving an extra one later.

      Wonderful new about Gerogie - I am pleased. Also George's
      advice sounded worth looking ito. The Savages sound nice:
      give Beryl my love.
      I don't think I can find a surveyor this week, but I will start
      enquiries this week, so we'll have him very shortly.
      The only numbers I can find on a Blackheath bulb one there:
      210-40W. Is that what you want? If not I'll try
      again.
      Love the sketch of Cawdor Castle. I well remember our visit.
      I hope the weather does not hold up your work on it.

      I enclose a copy of the last but one version of my review
      of M's sculpture show. I changed it a bit. But only a very
      little. This will give you a substantial impressio I think
      of what will be printed.

      No more people at Harpenden yet but I think that it should
      go on. Barnstead tonight: I hope to get things straght
      there this evening.

      See you Sunday. I love & adore you. love you
      Lawrence

      P.S. By all means coe to the KA but I think you ought to go to
      the concert at teh Grenwoods one being since it is so important
      to John. You can get a seat away from Michael's (if you
      tell Georgie). Really if you can be careful about M. you
      should go. Love L-

      Blackheath
      6 October

      Dearest Sylvia
      I am as busy as one anticipated - but so far I have kept work under
      control. The Revoir lecture was successful: ca. 150 people. I am
      giving an extra one later.

      Wonderful news about Georgie - I am pleased. Also, George's
      advice sounded worth looking into. The Savages sound nice:
      give Beryl my love.
      I don't think I can find a surveyor this week, but I will start
      enquires this week, so will have him very shortly.
      The only numeros I can find on a Blackheath bulb are these:
      210 - 40w. Is that what you want? If not I'll try
      again.
      Love the sketch of Camden castle. I well remember our visit.
      I hope the weather does not hold up your work on it.

      I enclose a copy of the last but one version of my review
      of M's sculpture show. I changed it a bit, but only a very
      little. This will give you a substantial impression I think
      of what will be printed.

      No more people at Harpenden yet but I think that it should
      go on. Banstead tonight: I hope to get things straight
      there this evening.

      See you Sunday. I love & adore you. love you
      Lawrence

      P.S. By all means, come to the ICA but I think you ought to go to
      the concert as the Greenwoods are being nice & it is so important
      to John. You can get a seat away from Michael's (if you
      tell Georgie=. Really, if you can be careful about M, you
      should go. Love L.
