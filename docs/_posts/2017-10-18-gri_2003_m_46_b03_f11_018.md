      Blackheath  23 xii 1950

      Dearest Sylvia,

      I hope your journey was as comfortable as it looked:  window seat to yourself, rug, and a book of legends.

      Let me give you news immediately:  I have just finished typing the poems for the competition and will post them off with this.  There.  Among my Christmas cards, by the way, was one from Kenneth Garlick.

      I miss you very much and I wonder if you will go to the dentist this afternoon, or when.  I hope you are not suffering from your period.  Alas the post is haywire completely...  No letters from you yet, I expect.  What did come was M's Christmas card.  It is very nice, of course, but thoroughly disturbing, minatory and depressive.

      The only piece of a poem I have written since you went away is 'Snow is the buckle on the belt of - '.  I like it but it is still enigmatic to me.

      I had a hunt for a Christmas card kind of present for you, an extra one of course, and I found the book which I am also posting off this afternoon.  It's poems and light.

      Tiny sent Hetty a nice letter and a postal order which she has given to Yawolla as a present.  He was a little short of gunpowder for the explosive cigars.

      Paul [unclear]Southey[/unclear] was pleased to receive your regards and invited you to dinner but I told him that you

      Deareast Sylvia,

      I hope your journey was as comfortable as it looked: window seat to yourself, rug, and a book of legends.

      Let me give you news immediately: I have just finised typing the poems for the competition and will post them off with this. There. Among my Christmas cards, by the way, was one from Kenneth Garlick.

      I miss you very much and wonder if you will go to the dentist this afternoon, or when. I hope you are not suffering from your period. Alas the post is haywire completely... No letters from you yet, I expect. What did come was M's Christmas card. It is very nice, of course, but thorougly disturbing, minatory and depressive.

      The only piece of a poem I have written since you went away is 'Snow is the buckle on the belt of-'. I like it but it is still enigmatic to me.

      I had a hunt for a Christmas card kind of present for you, an extra one of course, and I found the book which I am also posting off this afternoon. It's poems and light.

      Tiny sent Retty a nice letter and a postal order which she has given to Yawolla as a present. He was a little short of gunpowder for the explosive cigars.

      Paul[unclear]Southely[/unclear] was pleased to receive your regards and invited you to dinner but I told him that you

      Dearest Sylvia,

      I hope your journey was as comfortable as it looked: window seat to yourself, rug, and a book of legends.

      Let me give you news immediately: I have just finished typing the poems for this competition and will post them off with this. There. Among my Christmas cards, by the way, was one from Kenneth Garlick.

      I miss you very much and I wonder if you will go to the dentist this afternoon, or when. I hope you are not suffering from your period. Alas the post is haywire completely... No letters from you yet, I expect. What did come was M's Christmas card. It is very nice, of course, but throughly disturbing, minatory and depressive.

      The only piece of a poem I have written since you went away is 'Snow is the buckle on the belt of - '. I like it but it is still enigmatic to me.

      I had a hunt for a Christmas card kind of present for you, an extra one of course, and I found the book which I am also posting off this afternoon. It's poems and light.

      Tiny sent Hetty a nice letter and a postal order which she has given to Yawolla as a present. He was a little short of gunpowder for the explosive cigars.
