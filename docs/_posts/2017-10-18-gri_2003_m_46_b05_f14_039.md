      part (!) of what she owes me--now
      at least I can pay any bills.  She
      is, among other things trying not

      What next!  as granmie would say!
      I hope the I.C.A. meeting
      was good this time, do tell me
      about it!  And I hope your lecture
      went well too.  I was struggling
      with the fruit in the compotier--
      "coutre jour" I think they are finish-
      ed but am not quite sure until
      I get more of the picture in.
      I'm so glad to hear "productive"
      news of Pank--and I do hope it
      will make things more comfortable
      and successful for him soon.  He
      has got many itneresting ideas on the

      4  Clifford's lecture on March the 10th -
      You will be pleased to hear
      that Mrs. Blackwell has paid
      part(!) of what she owes me - now
      at least I can pay my bills. She
      is , among, other things trying not
      to pay for the hire of the gas meter!
      What next! as grannie would say!
      I hope the I.C.A. meeting
      was good this time, do tell me
      about it! And I hope your lecture
      went well too. I was struggling
      with the fruit in the compotier -
      "coutre jour" I think they are finish-
      ed but am not quite sure until
      I get more of the picture in.
      I'm so glad to hear "productive"
      news of Paul - and I do hope it
      will make things more comfortable
      and successful for him soon. He
      has got many interesting ideas on the
      theatre which it is badly in need of.
      Most sets are superlatively dull.
