      Blackheath 9 X

      Dearest Sylvia,
      I know we arranged that you should not
      expect letters from me, but I did not
      know the arrangement worked both ways.
      I hope that you are well and not worried
      or rushed.
      I have not gone in the house agents. We left
      it, I think, so that they would tell us if
      anybody else made an offer and as I
      have nothing absolutely certain to tell
      them I thought it best to wait until you
      come - perhaps with definite news about
      tell loan.
      I saw Roland Penrose last night and he
      likes the idea of a lecture on science
      fiction at the ICA: I suggested sometime
      in the new year, as I'm so busy now.
      Also Dorothy Morland has invited me to
      contribute to a symposium of Klee's Ped-
      agogigal Sketch Book in November. [unclear]Of[/unclear]
      parents David Sylvester thought of me for
      this.

      I know we arranged that you should not expect letters from me, but I did not know the arrangement worked both ways. I hope that you are well and not worried or rushed..

      I have not gone in to the house agents. We left it, I think, so that they would tell us if anybody else made an offer and as I have nothing absolutely certain to tell them I thought it best to wait until you come - perhaps with definite news about the loan.

      I saw Roland Penrose last night and he likes the idea of a lecture on science fiction at the ICA. I suggested sometime in the new year, as I'm so busy now. Also Dorothy [unclear]Morland[/unclear] has invited me to contribute to a symposium on Klee's Pedagogical Sketch Book in November .Parently David Sylvester thought of me for this.

      dearest Sylvia
      I know we arranged that you should not expect letters from me, but I did not know the arrangement worked both ways. I hope that you are well and not worried or rushed.
      I have not gone in to the house agents.  We left it, I think, so that they would tell us if anybody else made an offer and as I have nothing absolutely certain to tell them I thought it best to wait until you come - perhaps with definite news about the loan.
      I saw Roland Penrose last night and he likes the idea of a lecture on science fiction at the ICA - I suggested sometime in the new year, as I'm so busy now.  Also Dorothy Morland has invited me to contribute to a symposium on Klee's Pedagogical Sketch Book in November.  Apparently David Sylvester thought of me for this.
