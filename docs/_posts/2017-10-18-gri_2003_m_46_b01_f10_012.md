      This is an owl's eye-view of Dandylion inspecting the improvements, if that's what they are, in Trafalgar Square.

      It is symptomatic that we should both respond so strongly to Chateaubriand's tragic love.  It shows where our thoughts are, longing to overcome frustration.  Do you know Lavinia Fenton's story?  She played Polly in The Beggar's Opera and beguiled in so doing the young Duke of Bolton who made her his mistress.  They were happy and later married very successfully.

      I love you, Sylvia.
