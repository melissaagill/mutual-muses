      Dearest Lawrence,
      I am delighted that the
      [unclear]Sheas[/unclear]- McEvoy before was so
      successful. I wish I had heard
      it, for although I may have
      given you some ideas to work
      on I'm sure your lecture was
      full of very interesting points of
      your own. Anyway I feel
      very proud of us both!
      I do hop you manage
      to have lunch with Lord Ancaster
      (hasn't he some excellent portraits
      by Angelica Kauffman?) I
      think it is both pleasent and
      useful to meet distinguished
      people- do go.
      I have done a little on
      my white still life- a ton
      of framing and some gardening

      Dearest Lawrence,
      I am delighted that the
      Steer-McEvoy lecture was so
      successful. I wish I had heard
      it, for although I may have
      given you some ideas to work
      on I'm sure your lecture was
      full of very interesting points of
      your own. Anyway I feel
      very proud of the us both!
      I do hope you manage
      to have lunch with Lord Ancaster
      (hasn't he some excellent portrait
      by Angelica Kauffman?) I
      think it is both pleasant and
      useful to meet distinguished
      people - do go.
      I have done a little on
      my white Still life - a lot
      of framing and some gardening
      I have not started my small
