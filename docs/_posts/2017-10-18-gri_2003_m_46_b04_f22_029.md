      in Paul's<br/>new pictures - I do hope that it goes well - and that you have
      not<br/>quite disheartened him!  What a charming provisional title.  I<br/>am
      very much looking forward to<br/>seeing his new work.<br/>When I have finished
      my<br/>mill landscape I must start<br/>my big mural!  The portrait<br/>of Desiree
      is going better now.<br/>She is a nice girl - I like her<br/>
