      Queen and a ravishing Prince!
      I told you the beginning of the
      story--it was about Gowmond
      met!
      I hope you will soon be able
      to finish the 18th half of your
      film book.  In Clifford's Figaro
      Litterare Mourian is de-
      nouncing Cocteau's later
      play--"Bacchus" as
      blasphemous!  I will save
      you the article.
      I must go and get the
      supper.
      I have read the articles
      and they are not at all
      woeful except that they
      give one an idea of the
      play which I will in my
      next letter.
      I love you, my darling,
      I love you.

      the story - it was about Gownmend met!<br/><br/>I hope you will soon be able
      to finish the 18th half of your film book. In Clifford's Figaro Literature Kouriar
      is denouncing Coctear's latest play - "Bacchus" as Blasphemous! I will save
      you the astide.<br/><br/>I must go and get the supper.<br/><br/>I have read
      the articles and they are not at all useful except that they give one an idea
      of the play white I will in my next letter.<br/><br/>I love you, my darling,
      <br/>I love you<br/>Sylvia.
