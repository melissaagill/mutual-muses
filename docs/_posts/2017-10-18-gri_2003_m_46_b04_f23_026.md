      Dearest Lawrence,
      I enclose a note for you
      to present to Mr. Chase at Nov 1
      if you would be so kind; in
      case the correct notice does
      not arrive in time.  I wonder
      if you have heard of any comments
      on your portrait!
      I will be wonderful to see
      you on the 6th.  I feel nervous
      and depressed at the moment
      Tiny's sister died early in the
      morning which is a very good
      thing though very painful and
      sad for Tiny and her family.
      Poor Clifford has to go to Croydon
      on Saturday to take the funeral.
      As he is so busy and rather over
      tired it is rather a strain.
      Tiny is, of course, gone to Littlehamp-
      ton to break the news to her
      mother and stay until her
      other sister comes back which
