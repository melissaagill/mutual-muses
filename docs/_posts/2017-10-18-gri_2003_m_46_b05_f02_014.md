      but I said that I thought he should.  Carefully selected ones
      would I think govenise with your works very well.
      The day is dull, now.  The early sum is grey viled..
      I seem always to be in trains or strange beds.  Stuffy
      non-smoking components on cold bedrooms.  I long to
      be home again.  Even more I long to be with you there.
      Forgive my letters being to school--lion isnt in ap-
      pearance but I have no paper materials with me.
      I feel like one theme in Intolerance.  I am incomplete
      with the other thre--yourself.  I wonder how your paint-
      ing is going.  I keep wondering but have no means of
      drawing exactly (despite many guesses).  I desire most
      of all news of you yet there is only the urban or suburban
      landscape to which I am confined.  Or for the splen-
      dors of Babylon to complete this present.
