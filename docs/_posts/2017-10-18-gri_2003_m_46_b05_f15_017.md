      2.  The wind has been very cold (East) and

      exposed as it seems unshattered in
      the paddock, but warm in the rose
      garden.  My still life is going nicely
      but it is rather a struggle, I am working
      on the grapes which are going well.

      yellow, which I am using for the

      which is beautifully luminous as the

      2 bless and Jesse next ago!
      I have now finished the grapes then
      green dish and reflection.  I shall hope
      to finish tomorrow, but it may take
      longer.  It is much milder this evening
      so I shall do some garden, tomorrow
      morning if it is not wet.

      2.
      The wind has been very cold (East) and so I thought it wiser not to be too exposed as it seems unsheltered in the paddock; but warm in the rose garden. My still life is going nicely but it is rather a struggle, I am working on the grapes which are going well. I am using my newfound colour - Indian yellow, which I am using for the grapes, with veridian and lemon yellow which is beautifully luminous as the Indian yellow is a very transparent colour. 2 blues and Tesse Vert also!
      I have now finished the grapes their green dish and reflection - I shall hope to finish to-morrow, but it may take longer. It is much milder his evening so I shall do some gardening to-morrow morning if it is not wet.
      I must read M.Dick too. I can't put down E.Waters either!
