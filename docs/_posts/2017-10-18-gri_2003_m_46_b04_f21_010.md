      Pett                 6.9.51
      Dearest Lawrence,
      I started the Cricket Field Gate picture this morning. I have "roughed it in" and painted the sky.  I think it should be nice. The sky is mist blue of course - opaque looking - with a few tiny flecks of clouds on the left. I have worked in white into daps of colour - cobalt new blue and a little lemon yellow I didn't need the usual small amount of crimson (alizarin) as the ground is quite a warm white. I hope to do a good deal more to-morrow. This afternoon Clifford Desiree and I went bathing - it was devine - almost perfect - the sea is not really very warm now because of the North winds we had I think.
