      On my way back / passed St John's Chapel which we use to see on my way to Belsize Park.  By the way, do not forget that when your oil of tee Tree is in London.  I should like to go and see it.  You said it would be possible.  It was the first picture I say of yours I still remember the pleasure of that early impression.

      I saw your signature in the book at the V and A slide office.  How tidy and small it was compared to your usual splendid baroque one.

      Dandylion has just washed his hair.  Hence this uncharacteristic aspect.

      I love you.

      when your [ail] of the Tree is in London, I should like to go and see it. You
      said it would be possible. It was the first picture I saw of yours and still
      remember the pleasure of that early impression. I saw your signature in the
      book at the V and A slide office. How tidy and small it was compared to your
      usual splendid baroque one. Dandylion has just washed his hair. Hence this uncharacteristic
      aspect. I love you. Lawrence

    clean_transcription: it is the Gourg  Gainsborough or an attrac-tive subject,
      Don't you agree? Aranthes subject he suggested which woired not vaste all the
      work I've done is  Hogorth's Fuerds. But he avoid overlappin until Antal is
      not possible in the time of my disposal. He offers to give all the assistance
      he can with Gainsborough. I natles like him. <br/>On my way back I passed St
      John's Chapel which we use to see on our way to Belgige Park; . By the way,
      do not forget that when your oil of the Tree is in London. I should like to
      go and see it. You  saig it would be possible. It was the first picture I saw
      of yours and Patile remember the pleasure of that early impression. <br/>I saw
      your signature in the book of the V and A slide office. How tidy and small it
      was compared to your usual splendid baroque one. <br/>Dandylion has just washed
      his hair. Hence this unclarocheristic Aspect... <br/>I love you. <br/>Lawrence
