      St. L. Observer have published Michael's drawing of Wellington Square. It looks
      very well indeed! While we were in town yesterday we met Mrs. Macdonald at the
      [unclear][/unclear] exhibition and she asked me to come and see her when I was
      next in town and I said I would. I hope we can arrange it when you are [unclear][/unclear].
      I am delighted with the idea of Rinaldo and [unclear][/unclear]-what aspect
      of the story are you going to treat? I'm glad you are doing the Tanquy, as it
      is at a gallery whose notices are more widely read I imagine. Please could you
      get me last week's Art News. It had something of the the Kensington gallery
      - but I think nothing about me. It doesn't matter bit about the head I can always
      send it in
