      finish your painting (which I admire very much) but I am glad that you liked
      The Titfield Thunderbolt. You make me wish to see it, again I thought that you
      might like it, and I'm glad I wasn't wrong. By the way, here is the poem I mentioned:\n
      \  The 2 rails of the branch line, slightly rusty,\n   cross the marsh, 5 feet
      above the streams\n   where waterlilies are, as for dessert.\n\n   The funnel
      rises, like an old top-hat;\n   the stock a single carriage - green as the weeds\n
      \  which pillow sleepers on the single way.\n\n   It will not run much longer,
      tho' it still\n   can flatten pennies to the cruder oval\n   of older coins
      pocketted by the earth.\n\nYou were absolutely correct about what I was doing
      at [unclear]Lios[/unclear] on Wednesday - answering questions about Rubens.
      I dealt only with the later work - stressing its organic, phan-tastic character,
      and also defending the iconological methods of humanist art. As you say - there
      were several people from the T.G. Today my subject is Giorgione/Titian - half
      lantern slides, half in the Gallery itself. I wish you were here to discuss
      it with. \n\nYesterday I was in the Redfern Gallery making notes on a Pasmore
      painting when Pasmore came in. I couldn't have arranged it better if I tried.
      Not surprisingly he invited me to lunch after that : we went to the Vega. I
      am having dinner at his place on Saturday."
