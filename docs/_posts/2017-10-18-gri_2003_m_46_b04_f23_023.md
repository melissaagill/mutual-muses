      Cambridge I think.  Anyway there were some charming things which were fairly late but pleasant among them an upright arm chair - which if cheap I will get for you, and some plates to match Hetty's cup.
      Thank you for the delicious poem -I am so happy, not only because it is delightful but because it shows that you are happy, I think.  I very much look forward to reading "Sylvia Bathing", oh dear Poet, how glad I am that you are working again.
      I'm afraid Clifford can't help you he had neither [unclear]Stimboy[/unclear] or "Le Revue Blanche".  He tells me that Nones is pronounced Nonez. I hope that is clear (like Inez)
      I must read some Conrad I never have.
      I feel tempted to buy
