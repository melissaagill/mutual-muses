      44 Qusen Street Redcar Yorkshire  8 11 1949
      Dearest Sylvia
      I have not seen much of Redcar yet. I am going to take a walk this afternoon to post this letter and so my next letter will contain more topographical information though I can tell you already it is very dull. It cannot in the least resemble Scarborough - for nobody would retire to redcar or even visit it. However that does not matter much as I shall be able to work undisctracted I hope. My lodgings are on the whole, excellent. The food is ample and (so far) varied. I had a cooked breakfast and the butter was home-made. Lunch, which I have just had, has filled me up almost beyond the point of comfort and included much meat. All meals appear to be included in Â£ 3..10..0 The drawback is the bedroom which is like a telephone kiosk and contains a rather uncomfortable bed to which i many become accustomed. However, I have a 'living room' downstairs with a fairly relaxing chair, a coal fire & c. The wife of the school master looks after me very amiably and maternally. The crates containing the exhibition have not yet arrived so I rang John with this news (not altogether unpleasant to this lecturer). He told me Gabriel white likes my exhibition draft and is, I quote, 'very friendly' so i expect that more money will be forthcoming.
