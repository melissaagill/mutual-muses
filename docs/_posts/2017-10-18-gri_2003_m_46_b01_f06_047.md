      Sunday

      11 Mansel Road
      Wimbledon

      My dearest Sylvia,
      I am not sure whether to pester you with questions about your
      travels or detail my own uneventful days. I expect you will tell me
      the things that you are enjoying particularly, anyway, but do be sure
      to tell me what you though of the Giorgione [unclear][/unclear] and other
      Venetian pictures in the Louvre. And don't forget to tell me what you
      think of the Monets in the Impressionist museum: I admire many of them.
      In the past few days I have done a lot of reading and
      seen Paul several times. Last night we had one penny between us.
      It rained all Saturday but today it is warmer than it has been for
      weeks [unclear][/unclear]. Pablo often has tea with me these days. I have strawberry
      jam and China tea. Pablo has his milk [unclear] [/unclear] with the China tea. It
      is a consolation to have him with me - his feline openness is charm-
      ing - now more than ever.
      I am sitting in the lounge by the opened French windows
      to write this. I have by me a pleasant box of chocolates which I nibble
      every so often - the gift of "an elderly lady of my acquaintance" to
      celebrate passing the exam.
      I have written the first of my poems for you while you are away.
      I have made them as Southern in decor as it is legitimate for me, caged on
      this island, to do so.

      Place de la Terre
      Utrillo-dazzling squares
      And skies you wouldn't call
      Temperate balancing
      Blue spheres upon the hills

      A sleepy satyr puffs
