      I am so glad that you like the bits and pieces I sent you.    The MSS you had were uncorrected - that is why there were various mistakes & curiosities.  I am revising and unifying my recent poems: I should have something to show you when you come.

      Relaxing a little I have read Hemingway's The Sun Also Rises: I do think it is good.  One realizes where he gets his great reputation.  Have you ever read it?  It has everything To Have & Have Not lacks.  Jake, the narrator, is marvellously defined, I think.

      It is 11:00.  I must wash up, shave, and make the bed.

      I shall see you very soon.  (love you Lawrence) XXXXXX
