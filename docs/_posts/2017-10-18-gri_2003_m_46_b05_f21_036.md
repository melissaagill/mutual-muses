      Dearest Lawrence,
      I forgot to ask you in my last
      letter so let me start with it--
      please can you bring an emergency
      card for meat--don't for get Tiny's
      margarine and if you could spare some
      cooking fat for me I should be most
      grateful.  Also if you could bring some
      nice cheese for it is rather scarce here,
      so sorry to bother you.
      I'm so sorry you are still so run down.
      I fear that part of the trouble may
      be continual money worries--my
      poor Lion his angst is coming out in
      spots and lumps!  I wish you could
      get the York job.
      I am delighted by your birthday
      presents--I long to see Ophel!
      I haven't been able to get on with
      Cliff End this morning it was dull so
      have painted a sketch of the Pear tree
      at home, this afternoon.  I have worked

      [19.9.52] Pelt

      Dearest Lawrence- I forgot to ask you in my last letter so let me start with it - please can you bring an emergency card for meat - don't forget Jimy's margarine and if you could spare some cooking fat for me I should be most grateful.  Also if you could bring some nice cheese for it is rather scarce here, so sorry to bother you.  I'm so sorry you are still so run down I fear that part of the trouble may be the continued money worries - my poor Lion his angst is coming out in spots and lumps!  I wish you could get the York job.  I am delighted by your birthday presents - I long to see [unclear]Arphel[/unclear]!  I haven't been able to get on with Cliff End this morning it was dull so have painted a sketch of the Pear tree at home- this afternoon I have worked
