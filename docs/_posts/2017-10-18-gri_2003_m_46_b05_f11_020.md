      26 XI 1952 Dearest Sylvia
      Delighted to learn that your Ditchling
      (Ditibley?) visit was a success. What
      did you tell them about Molly? Has
      John any new films to 'musicalise'?

      Thank you for sending me the cheque &
      the subscription form - I will give
      them both to Father this evening.

      I hope everything goes smoothly at Pett -
      your art, your nights, the Woods. And
      if you hear any gossip about the Pitt
      Loons - or whatever the players call them-
      selves - do pass it on to this willing
      ear.

      My Inigo Jones lecture ought to go
      well as I have all the slides that the V & A
      possesses and I have looked up dates &
      facts. I am looking forward to it rather.

      Last evening with VP was very pleasant.
      My contribution to the Manifesto will be a
      short account of attempts in 20c art to deal
      with the machine (futurists, dadairts, Leges, &c.) -
