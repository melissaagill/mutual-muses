      A few lines in his hand:
      'Do cages island me or do I [unclear]evide[/unclear] them?'

      The W.E.A. visitor last night suggests that I write to Harold Sherman at London University and try and get an Appreciation of Art Class on a University basis (more money). So I shall follow that up, of course.
      I have another idea for a film chapter: Unanimism and the American Mob - or some such title - comparing Jules Romains' panoramas of collective activity with U.S. race films in which the community is the 'hero'. Unanimism is the name of Romains' now rather unfashionable theories. Munch's Workers Going Home is parallel, in ways with his concerns - & Eisenstein's revolutionary films, also. It's all new & shapeless at the moment but I am hopeful. It will relate with Key to the City.
