To facilitate the review of our transcription ranking method, this directory contains the script to generate a Jekyll site with one page per document, displaying the page image, transcriptions, and the selected "winner".

The generated pages are already committed to this repo, and can be viewed at <https://thegetty.github.io/mutual-muses/>.
`_build/build.sh` will run the R script to reproduce these pages from the derived data generated from the `analysis` directory.
