To facilitate the review of our transcription ranking method, this directory contains the script to generate a Jekyll site with one page per document, displaying the page image, transcriptions, and the selected "winner".

Note that these pages are included here only as an artifact of our project workflow. 
They are not intended to be a finished, user-friendly publication platform and we canâ€™t guarantee that they will continue to work or display properly, or that the text contained on them reflects the final edited versions of these transcriptions.

The generated pages are already committed to this repo, and can be viewed at <https://thegetty.github.io/mutual-muses/>.
`_build/build.sh` will run the R script to reproduce these pages from the derived data generated from the `analysis` directory.
