## Datasets 

This repository contains three datasets: 

* `data/raw/` contains raw subjects and classifications metadata exported from the Zooniverse platform 
* `data/analyzed_transcriptions.csv` is the full dataset containing all 14,467 transcriptions and image identification classifications collected as part of the Mutual Muses project with outputs from the consensus algorithm
* `data/selected_transcriptions.csv` is a curated dataset of transcriptions of the 2,376 original documents, selected by the consensus algorithm, that have been further cleaned manually

## Description 

The corpus of letters originate from the archives of art critic [Lawrence Alloway (1926-1990)](http://primo.getty.edu/GRI:GETTY_ALMA21135991340001551) and feminist artist [Sylvia Sleigh (ca. 1916-2010)](http://primo.getty.edu/GRI:GETTY_ALMA21136007870001551). Letters with text or annotations, including rectos and versos, were selected for transcription.  Envelopes, blank pages, pages without textual information, newspaper clippings, and other ephemera were considered out of scope and omitted from the project. 


### Data collection 

Transcription data was generated by external contributors using the [Zooniverse platform](http://www.zooniverse.org). We collected between 5 - 10 transcriptions for each document. Users were asked to transcribe full-page documents in a single session and instructed to do the following while transcribing:

* Maintain line breaks in the text
* Follow punctuation, capitalization, and other formatting, such as hyphens 
* Transcribe the letters as they are but correct any typographical errors 
* Not indicate when text is crossed out or underlined 
* Employ unclear tags, `[unclear]`, to indicate uncertainty in the accuracy of certain words or phrases in a transcription, for example: `The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy [unclear]dog[/unclear]`.
* Not include diacritics if they are present in the transcription, but indicate so in a follow-up prompt. 

### Post-processing script 

To select a “best” transcription for each document, we tokenized each transcription and, for every pairwise combo of transcriptions for a document, calculated the ratio of tokens that one transcription contained of the other. The transcription with the highest median ratio of tokens thus contains high percentages of all the other documents, indicating both high information as well as high consensus with the rest of the group. We used this metric as a way to select a winning transcription for each document.

### Data cleaning 

After a transcription was selected for each document, Getty Research Institute staff conducted several cleaning tasks that are reflected in the`data/selected_transcriptions.csv` dataset. Spelling errors were corrected using a spell check tool across the entire dataset. Diacritics and currency symbols were manually entered for 222 transcriptions in which the majority users indicated the document contained diacritics (staff used an average of scores gathered from multiple transcriptions to identify the selected transcriptions with diacritics, between 1.0-0.67). Staff conducted additional cleaning of commonly misspelled proper names for people and locations across the dataset. 

Note that data cleaning and standardization was not comprehensively executed across the dataset, other than sell check.
