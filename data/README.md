|special_ratio   |An average of all responses to the special character question for a document (subject) from 0 - 1. The higher the number, the more transcribers indicated a special character was present. |numeric      |0.6                                                           |Users indicated if document contained special characters, i.e., diacritics and currency symbols, after she completed a transcription. The field was used during post-processing by GRI staff to prioritize which transcriptions to manually enter diacritics and symbols. This work is reflected in the `annotation_text` field. Project staff entered diacritics and symbols for transcriptions with scores of 1 - 0.666666666666666 (222 transcriptions total). |
