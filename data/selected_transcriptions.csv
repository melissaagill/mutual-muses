I'm still not sure how long we will be at the address

The weather is superb here. We sat in the Luxembourg gardens for a time, only in shirt sleeves, and, 
last evening had a look at the Hotel Cluny as you recommended. It's really admirable: gothic craftsmanship 
in the windows (dormers especially) and renaissance forms
also. The place has grandeur and mystery and I kept thinking of [unclear]Rilke's[/unclear] half sensuous, half platonic meditations in 
there when he was Rodin's secretary. It is not open to
the public yet but I am going to try for permission to
see it.

I have got a French Vogue which I am sending off to-
morrow. I hope you will get some ideas for it though I might
as well admit that I keep thinking of you nude. I adore
you.

Politically I am isolated as ever and on every boarding 
rows of unintelligible initials jump like letters in a cubist

poet who can help me further in this matter.

My dearest Sylvia
Thank you so much for all your letters - all of which have now
come, much to my relief - and Albert's , too, incidentally, - as I kept
worrying about the delay.
I shall be back on Wednesday.  I am excited already at the prospect of seeing you after such a long while.  I think that on Friday it
would be best for you to make arrangements for sleeping with your friends
because there seems to be a slight antagonism between Albert and Evelyn
which I don't want to divert to myself.  I must see her when I return and
would prefer not to arrange it my letter until [unclear]then[/unclear] in case I jeopardise (oh, hell, I don't know how to spell it) our future chances which
will be good, I think.  Since you reminded me that it wouldn't be any 
good anyway on the 16th I felt this was the decision to make.
Today started in a café on the Champs Elysées with vermouth and
ham sandwiches, and macaroons.  We had been to the Follies Bergere, oh
what a bore! Home, we had to walk, by two o'clock. Up again at ten. In
the afternoon I went to look at the Picassos, Malloils, Légere, Braques,
Brancusi, &c.  Then I got some books, including Edith Sitwell's English
Eccentrics which looks enchanting, fabulous, witty.
I wrote this poem this morning at about 2.30.  I doubt its com-
plete yet but as it's about you this letter is the place for it.

Weighing a thousand beds with their flesh

Dearest Sylvia,

Thank you so much for your letter. You really should not apologize for it because you evoked very vividly the places you had seen, especially the landscapes. And, of course, the Pitti interiors which sound ravishing. I suppose the Adam-like decoration comes from the Raphaelesque Grotesque based on Roman work? And, oh, Pietro da Cortona ceilings... Well, you can imagine how I feel about them! Are they not too hot in color: I expect color is the weakest point. How I look forward to seeing them one day...

The landscapes you write of put me in mind of the best Corots. I am glad you stressed that part of Italy in your letter because it suggested to me some lines in a poem I was writing.  I had been stuck. Then your letter came and the obstruction was removed. (The poems are at the end of the letter.) You seem to be enjoying sculpture very much: it is almost impossible to see anything in England of course. Now that you have seen the two early Giorginne's I would be interested to have your opinion of the Hampton Court one. Is it alright do you think still?

San Miniato sounds a delight. The familiar words with, alas, only literary associations ring in my mind.  ...Arno... Rosselino... Baldovinetti... all assembling a picture of fabulous pleasures to me and of actual experience to you. The facade is ravishing from what you say. 

Thank you for the address which take me up to the 14th. You should have found two letters at Siena: did you? And three at Florence. I make the point because you imply a criticism of my writing. Perhaps I imagine it. No, re-reading I think it is there. How was the Palazzo at Siena; as grand as it sounds? Is food and accomodation very expensive. Albert and John, by the way, are in Italy by now - concentrating, I think, on Venice. 

I have had no news (despite promises) of the room at East Sheen so I suppose I shall have to start looking elsewhere soon. I met John Skipp the other day. I do not like him very much but we talked all afternoon and that is a good sign. There is a good chance, now, of occasional work with travelling exhibitions:  £10 a week, with extra for expenses and other matters. An admirable rate is it not. ",1,FALSE

Dearest Sylvia,

I love you.  Why do I start like that?  Simply because I do not think I have started a letter like that before.  One tends to end with those words.  They make a fine conclusion but they make the best opening too.

How often you occur to my imagination.  I stand a little back, as it were, so that I can see you full-length against the Italian scene - or the vague dazzling thing which stands for that landscape.  I thought of you yesterday at my lecture: I mentioned Vermeer's interest in emblems and though I kept on talking I remembered most distinctly our trip to Greenwich, and I then thought of you and where you might be THEN, at about a quarter past eleven.  Your new dress is almost known to me by now.

About 70 people came to the lecture.  I put in De Hooch as well as the others because I had time to kill at the end.  I think it went alright and I no longer wish for the lights to go out and the first slide to come on the screen.  Claire was there and she said I ought to speak up more in this big room. vii.

I have been twice to the Grand Ballet de Monte Carlo and seen Balanchine's Concerto Barocco, Lifar's Noir at Blanc, and Five Gifts which has decor and costumes by Leonor Fini whom I like as you know.  She made quite a successful design for the piece.  Later in the season they are doing Les Biches (Laurencin décor) and a ballet by Dali and Paul Bowles.  They are a fairly good company: Eglevsky is with them now and they have a fine ballerina in Rosalla Hightower.  It was good to see ballet again after so long.

I had a welcome surprise from the bank today.  I actually have over nine pounds in my account.  How much pleasanter this news than the overcharging in Michael's last statement.

My visit to Bath will start on the 18th and be either a long weekend or a week.  The 18th of September I mean.

This must be a hasty note, because I must be off in a few minutes to have tea with Charles and talk about my school lectures.  Perhaps I shall stun him, leave him in the Gentlemen's at the Vega and take his place for the weekend,  I know most of his clichés so the deception might work.

I hope, dearest, that your cold is getting better.  I am quite concerned.  Look after yourself, dearest.  Did you catch it painting that ravishing view of the golden woods?  If so I am sure it was worth it.

You remember the Cupids and so on over the mantlepieces at Hampton Court? Well I have adapted them into T. Stothard-like vignettes for you.

not seen any of his work before. Thank you so very much.
Michael's puff is nice - please thank him for his courteous and
appreciative report. As to the short story: Ghosts Get Results is almost all I have done in that style. I have some ideas
but no time to perfect them for I am not experienced in fiction. 
I do want to try for the Greenwood prize though.

Darling I think it would be splendid to be at Pett with you.
I should prefer that to staying in London naturally so please
try to attain this for I know you would prefer it. I have not
obtained yet any lectures, beyond three at the N.G. to schools,
the first of which was yesterday. The LCC have sent me formal
application forms and so have the WEA: I shall send them back
with all information. Tomorrow morning I have an appointment
with the Educational Centres Assoc. London University have
nothing until September... I wrote to Sir H H and he replied
today asking for my full qualifications - to see if I am worth 
assisting. That is the position at the moment. I should have
more news shortly you see.

The school children were very pleasant. I told them tales
of St Jerome's lion and though of Dandylion all the time.

I hope you enjoy your party on Saturday: I am sure you will 
once you get there. That is a conventional reflection, but
still, I mean it. I shall think of you and how charming and
beautiful you will look.

I long for the blackberry leaves and the chrysanthemums.
I anticipate them with great pleasure and excitement.

The Owls enjoyed their week-end at Bath very much. Dandylion
met them at the Coach Station and carried their bags. They said
they would write to you but I see they are such bad correspondents. 
The White One I am sorry to say scratched his name on the Palladian Bridge in Prior Park. They are both well.

Charles sounds more odious than ever. I saw his scratchy
constipated drawing of Pett and said that i did not find the 'freedom'
and 'feeling' of some other pieces by him. I felt like Eric New-
ton but, after all, lectures. £1 each time. I appreciate your
outburst against Anderson and Gilbert, which is very comic and

The exhibition of Berthe Morisot's work organised by the Arts
Council prompted, of course, the usual observations on art and
femininity.  Eric Newton, speaking for many as usual, wrote in
'The Listener': 'though one could easily deduce her sex without
looking at the signature on her pictures, that does not make her
a less competent painter though it does make her a
less whole-hearted impressionist'.  In fact, the non-impressionist
undercurrent derives, not from her sex but from her relationship
with the contemporary Symbolist movement.  She was influenced by
the symbolist Gauguin in the early 1890s ('Peasant Girl Lying Down',
for example) but a more intimate link is with Mallarmé who christened one of Berthe Morisot's garden conversations 'Le Fable', a title which accents the allusive quality of her art.
'Boats Under Construction' (exhibited at the second Impressionist exhibition) is a painterly notation of things seen.  The portrait of her husband 'Eugene Manet Looking out at the Sea from a
Window, Isle of Wight' (1875) is also a pure impressionist work.
If we compare the tender but sculpturesque 'Young Woman in a Ball 
Dress' (1979-80) with 'Young Woman on a Sofa' (1879) symbolist characteristics in the latter become clear: the empty
spaces round the single figure are curiously evocative and the flowers and fan size are favorite
images of Mallarme.  The superb 'Child with her Doll' (1884) reveals
strong symbolist attachments with its floating forms disintegrating
in a tangible avalanche of light.  Colour and light are freed from
objective functions in Berthe Morisot's work of 1881-84. This trans-",1,FALSE

Dearest Sylvia,
Yesterday I went, as I told you in my previous letter, to 
the Albertian drawings, which turned out to be more comprehensive 
than the English versions.  Also I visited an exhibition of the 
treasures of Italian libraries ill. mss. & drawings & tapestries 
from the 14th C to 16th C.  This I must see again because it contains much 
that is new to me.
This morning I have been at the Louvre, accompanied there as 
everywhere by intense memories of you: All the big Davids are 
there now and I certainly agree with you about the Sacré; it is marvel-
ous.  This afternoon I shall see the exhibition at the Petit Palais 
of the virgin in French art--an unpleasant theme but one which is 
sure to comprise many fine works.  You will see I am taking my 
time quite seriously.
I am writing this at a café near the Louvre, facing the Seine.   I 
have just had a steak.  (I ate last night by the way in James Joyce's 
restaurant, the Polydor.)  Cars dash by and I fear for my demi-carafe of

The American girl I mentioned earlier, Jeanne Koepfer, said that what interested her in Paris was what you could find in any city and her drawings, in keeping with this, are very generalised &, occasionally, subtle. I must, however, disagree, I am aware all the time of differences between Paris &, for example, London. Not simply in terms of town planning but in attitude in the people. Possibly I've been fortunate but French, good-nature in small dark encounters has been evident &, the other night, in La Verte Galante, that small park on the tip of the Isle de la Cité, I detected, or fancied I did, much more pleasant relations between the various generations of the family units than in England or, Jeanne Koepfer had to admit, America. Maybe this is just a feature of the tyranny of church & mother but it has an attractive external calm, a contentment. In the Champs Élysées you may be fined for driving a car at LESS than 30 mph. That is unlike London! Parisian motorists are representatives of the father that castrates, as in Rome. Gruyère cheese has just come, it's great holes scooped out by the fitful light of this fine but not as consistently sunny day. I love you so much & wish, oh so strongly, you were here to share Paris with me. It is a marvellous city, a stimulating & suitable setting for your beauty & intelligence. I wish you were here.

Dearest Sylvia 
Many thanks for your long and interesting letter - of exactly the kind a lion likes. Your pageant sounds as if it must have been admirable, judging from your vivid description.  I am glad a jack-of-the-Green was found room for. Your letter is not with me at present (I am in a café across the river from the end Pavilion of the Louvre, a sinister yellow drink before me) but your attitude about your paintings is excellent. I hope you will finish some more soon. 
Today I did not wake until very late (11 o'clock) so I only spent the afternoon at a museum. I have just left the Petit Palais where I have paid particular attention to the Gothic sculptures in La Vierge dans L'art francais. I have an illustrated catalogue - as I have of the Louis XV et Rocaille & I will show them to you with rare pleasure on my return. 
This evening I am having dinner with Jeanne Koepfer: she is leaving Paris in a day or so. Peter Simmons of course is jealous of my friendship with her as his American girl is rather elusive.  Yesterday I went to St Chappelle but Tuesday it is fermée. I have, however, been to Notre Dame at last, after years, and admired it very much. I thought of you so hard as I went conscientiously over the church. Apart from that I saw no galleries & finished some poems, copies of which I will include in my next letter. I think of you all the while, wishing so much you were with me. The pond in the Tuileries where we sat the evening before travelling to Italy has become a favorite nostalgic place for your lion. I am slightly depressed, missing you very much, & longing to see you again. 
I have made a sketch of [unclear]A ( [/unclear] 15th fresco of The Flight Into Egypt, at the Petit Palais, which may interest you. It is full of castles, rivers, ships, trees, as, I hope, the sketch shows. I like it very well & drew it for you as there is no photograph of it.

for you to come until then. (What about Miller?)

Will you come and see me on Thursday 6th. I have no lectures until Tuesday 11th when I think I shall have to spend the night at Petersfield. So we should have several days together, without visits to town except for Clifford's lecture. My big cheques have still not come but I have one cheque for £3 which we can live on over the weekend. Do come on the morning bus. I shall be back from Southend in good time to meet you. I am dying to meet you and love you and talk to you again.
I have written to Birmingham, following up your cutting. It seems curious applying twice for the same position...

   Pasmore admired your Ajax in The Past and particularly mentioned 
the rhythmic quality of your form.  He asked for your name and 
failing to catch what I said asked a second time, obviously wish-
ing to be sure of knowing the artist's name.  (The portrait of Hetty 
was not on view, by the way, as it is the centrepiece of a loan exh. 
at 100s of Lions.)
   We talked about art matters generally and in 
particular of the Tate Gal. exh.  He thought Malevich's White On White 
the most abstract picture in the show - 'a thing-in-its-own-right'; the 
Mondrians, however, he thinks are color symbolically and so are 
less concrete.  Malevich's square is dictated by the canvas whereas 
M's lozenge disrupts the given quality of the material.
   I gave him china tea, cucumber sandwiches (into which he can be said to have tucked), & choc. biscuits.  He invited me to 'drop 
in after supper' on Thursday which I accepted.  He is going to 
lend me a book by C. Biederman called Art As The Evolution of 
Visual Knowledge.  It deals with ideas of art in which P 
is interested and as I think I shall use my opportunity to write 
about Pasmore (he favours the idea) I need to know this book.  
Biederman is messianic but, probably, talented.
   Tomorrow Monday my lecture will go like this, roughly:  
Rousseau's Dream (monumental; and primitivism of theme); Derain 
(would-be monumentalist & naive primitivism); Chagall (public 
theme in near monumental terms); Lam (Jungle, the 'real thing'); 
Léger (monumental & popular, like Rousseau); Picasso; (monu-
mental & private) Artist & Model.  On the theme of large works 
I can cover some of the works so far omitted.
   Pasmore and I went for a walk after tea before he returned 
home and I feel pleasantly fresh after strolling on the Heath.  
It is time for dinner, very nearly.  I had an omelette for 
lunch, close on the heels of an 11.00 breakfast, & tea is discussed 
above:  for dinner I shall have a tin of meat, potatoes; 
then pears and bananas; and milk.  I propose to go to bed

Thank you for your stimulating and loving letter. It makes me very happy. How kind of you to send me Horizon so soon - and Masson: thank you, dearest love.
I was interested in C's reasons for disliking Auden. I quite see that he preaches, and so does Eliot, so does Greene. But do Montherlant and Maurier really only state? Surely both these writers fix things to justify their own attitudes? Surely they only decide on the destiny of their characters, and so on, to express an attitude. I think the test is not objectivity versus preaching but whether form and content suit each other: not whether the content is legitimate outside the form but if it suits the form. By this test Auden at his best seems to me good. The content of Limestone is ridiculous: its relation to form exquisite. (That is my present view though I acknowledge the pressures which cause one to take sides.) 
Delighted that Armida progresses so well. Admirable: I am pleased. (I read the Nicholson article in the Burlington Magazine at breakfast (because you said you had read it): I agree it is disjointed - but what a nice frontispiece, don't you think?)  I long to see R and A again. It is a tradition which starts in the South, comes North (to the frontispiece, e.g.), then is southernised again in the Rococo.
My film book goes very well. I have written a 1000 words, at least, on Dreamboat which I saw yesterday. In fact I probably should not have gone to the cinema yesterday - nor worked on my lectures at the Tate Gallery as long as I did, for my glands have swollen again. However, Dreamboat is excellent: you should certainly see it. Kiss Me Kate was very enjoyable, also - quite well handled by a Touring Co. with Chris. Hewett (of the Watergate Review) in the lead.
What marvellous news about yet another American letter of praise for the Rector. I know ow much C admires Ellis, too. Do congratulate him for me. I am sorry Haine is little better: how extraordinary about New Zealand. I am disgusted with that ridiculous place.
Lion is gradually collecting material for the Sex Lecture (I seem I am in a What's On advertisement for the Sex Ed. Soc!), not all of which I may use, but I would like a margin. Something we left out was a case history or two of particular artists: I shall try and work on in (Hogarth, Nijinsky, Leonardo - I don't know who yet), {how about The Psychopathology of Dame Laura Knight?]
Lincoln Girls' School mistake me for Superman. They want 3 lectures in the morning: in the afternoon I introduce 5 art films; in the evening another lecture. However no duties on Saturday to speak of & I shall get £15.
The Nov. Athene progresses well: even the ""May"" one advances.
Do not worry about me. My glands will go down again over the weekend - certainly by the time you read this on Monday. I shall do my work in a semi-horizontal position: LION as recumbent-reader. I shall not give up any more lectures as long as I still have a chin!

BLACKHEATH
SUNDAY

Dearest Sylvia,

We shall have to travel on the afternoon train (immediately after lunch) to Paris as the morning is booked up for
some time ahead. It is not too bad for we arrive in Paris
at 11 and I am going to find a hotel to write to if I can
but, in any case, there are plenty in the neighbourhood of
the Gare du Nord.

The train for Milan leaves the next evening so we should
use most of the time in Paris to rest  but we can look at anything you want to see in the afternoon. I am writing to
Alberzo Pre-Alpi, Via Agnello, Milano, which Charles recom-
mended. But you might write yourself to the hotel you know
to be doubly sure - using the Blackheath address. I wish
you would.

Domsch recommends the Pensione Bandini, Piazzo S. Spirito,
9, Firenze to which I shall write. But Michael had better
write 'Poste Restante', in case they have no room.

I have booked and paid for the Rome to Venice via Bologna journey and as a result have little money. Please, therefore, will you bring the £5 in currency you are allowed as I 
have lots of foreign money but scarcely any sterling.

It seems likely that the American Bellinis may be included
in the exhibition. Barbara Coombes has an idea they are.
Oh, I hope so.

On Wednesday I imagine you will come in the afternoon or

meet you at Eastbourne. Not at Hastings, which was my first
thought, for obvious reasons. Do not fear for the cost, it
will be small as I can get a cheap day ticket. Do allow me
to do this. Sharing the journey with you will make up for
the one to Hastings which I did not make with you last Spring
on a sudden invitation the same day. Tell me, if you know,
which end of the train you are likely to be.

I wonder if you would tell me, in a letter to reach me, if
possible, on Tuesday, any shopping I should do which you can
think of and which I might forget. You know what I am. Any 
suggestions for sandwiches or small practical things, &c.

We met also a lot of other people of various races and most of them painters.  I enjoyed numerous arguments & discussions.  (I am glad to be staying at home today for it was a long day & I was rather tired.)  Oh, and, yes, we did see the Pavilion.  I thought of you so often, my dearest.
Your new picture is clearly a portrait of John 'Raphael' Smith of [unclear]Marland, (D. Marland[/unclear], of course).

I do hope you are well again and that you are seeing Bath in detail (even, perhaps, doing some drawing).  Have you meet my parents yet, I wonder...  I want you, if you will, to do an illustration for my Bath poem - illustrating the capriccio section.  I think that would be an amusing subject.  Do you?

Paris is very noisy & restless.  The celebrations began last
night and will go on, I believe, tomorrow also.  Street
dances began about 10.00 yesterday, under flags and paper
lanterns.  Today it has rained so I fear that some of the
decorations will be damaged.  I have not been out yet,
it is afternoon, but the sounds of music & fireworks suggest that no real interruption has occurred.  I am glad
to have a lazy day because I have not been early to
bed once.  This evening Peter & a Norwegian girl will
be joining Jeanne [unclear]Koepler[/unclear], an American called Dick
Brewer, and myself for the celebrations.  Even as I write
their names, however, I feel regret, nostalgia, that you
are away in England.  Would you were here!  Then we
could see Cocteau's new film Les Enfants Terribles to-
gether, which is running at the Pantheon cinema (where I
first saw la Belle et la Bete).  I admire so well the way in
which Paris has a native character and mood and can yet
support so many foreign, cosmopolitan visitors - including
some intelligent, liberal Americans, one or two of whom I
have been lucky enough to meet.  The other night, really
late, I bought André Bretón's L'amour Fou:  in England one
cannot buy a book after 5.30.  I appreciate a city which al-
lows   one the right to shop at 1.15.  I so wish you were here -

Dearest Sylvia -
    I am writing - as you can tell, I am sure, from the pen
in a post office. I have had lunch with Charles which was
terribly boring: if you think I was slack in  a fortnight in Paris
you should hear what Charles did not do in his 9
days! I shall not waste space on him further.
     I was charmed to notice in Brighton the large number of
very dignified cats - most of them employing the Regency
setting better than their owners. Really, I have never seen
so many fine cats at once. I enjoyed the Pavilion furnish-
ings very much, though the arrangement is by no means com-
prehensive or ideal. One charming clock has a shepherd (Narcissus?)
leaning on a plinth holding the dial, below which is a lion's
head spouting a glass spiral which rotates, & appears like
water. There is a mirror base.
     I expect Tiny has sat for you by now - I hope so. Tomorrow
I am devoting to lectures which I must get ready & the end
of the week I shall devote to finishing the Hogarth chapter.
I am thinking of analyzing a cowboy film in terms of the

this evening - probably to another Western as Orphée is off.
I shall have written some of it when you come, I hope.

Dearest Sylvia,

I do hope that your journey on Friday was not unbearable and that you were not expected to stay at the Greenwoods longer than a day. I hope you are back in Pett today and I wonder if you have kept your resolve about NOT going to the Remembrance service... I heard some maroons (?) at 11.00 so Yawolla and Hetty danced vigorously for two minutes until Hetty fell exhausted with her hair all over the place.

If only you had stayed on we should have been alright for B'ham have paid me for the Renoir. Increasingly I believe that hedonism is the only possible attitude. Every time I admit the necessity of planning ahead, bearing in mind future situations, something happens to show I could have had my cake and eaten it. Would, my dearest sweetheart, my love, that you had stayed. Look after the present and the future looks after you too, is the motto Hetty has painted round Yawolla's new cowboy hat.

So with the cheque, I went to Ted's: then I went to the N. G. and discovered some exciting new details in the Bronzino; read Martin Davies' book on Leonardo for next Saturday's lecture (Charles let me use his coffin); raced to the V & A, looked up a book on Bronzino. I have almost finished the Bronzino now and as I am taking a carbon copy I will send it to you in my next letter.

A bird has just been eating some berries on the holly tree for lunch. For mine I finished, apart from other courses, your delicious apple sweet. Thank you again for making it.

The right slides, almost, have come from the V & A and I must say I am glad to have the B'ham £6 so that I shall not be travelling without a penny to spare as I had expected to do. Also I have paid the milkman whose horse was getting impatient. And, I shall definitely be able to get to Norwich now.

By the way, see if you can guess, before my article comes, what the basic situation in the Bronzino is, or, at any rate, what my guess at it is. Partly I amplify Panofsky's manifest symbols, partly not.

The N G was their first experience of a Gallery since leaving America a few days ago. So for once I had a beautiful, well-dressed audience. Mrs Brock has tried before for lectures (she brings groups every year) but she has never been in a position to give Charles the proper 5-day notice. She was very glad in consequence to get a lecturer after years of frustrated attempts.

Now that I am in the train to leave Clacton I feel in a more amiable frame of mind than when I wrote the last letter an hour or so ago. 
Last night I had a long conversation (no, it was not a conversation if, as Proust says, conversation is a department of the in-telligence) with my landlady & a fellow-guest, an almost bald lady who teaches elocution. We discussed aeroplane-crashes: 'I'd as soon get in one of those airplanes as' - she sought for the right word, 'fly'. When our laughter at her half-deliberate, half-spontaneous jest died down, she produced two Austrian works of arts, medieval castles (one of which had inspired Walt Disney's background for Snow White, I was informed), burned on wood with an electrical needle. My admiration was moderate. She next produced a musical box which tinkled 'Roll out the barrel' as its walls, painted with flowers & ivory castles opened & shut compulsively. She only played it rarely as no English craftsman could be found to repair such delicate work, once it went wrong. The elocution teacher rolled ecstatically in the sofa, she is 50 at least, & said - 'Oh, it's so beautiful the way's its doors open & shut'. Then we discussed the outrageous taxation on musical boxes. £2 duty, it was. From which it was but a small step to what we had read in the Daily Telegraph.

me immensely after a restless night from which I awake with a

It was a pleasure to speak to you on the phone last evening. You know, as I was late, I had rung the Mayfair Hotel but they told me no Mr. Wood was there. Then when Tiny confirmed the address I went there & sure enough he was in the bar.
The lecture was excellent, really excellent: the discussion afterwards was not as amusing as when we went together but that was because Clifford's lecture was nothing less than definitive. The number of people was down, not much, but a little. Paul came and he very much enjoyed the lecture as well as admiring Clifford's charm & authority of manner. We had a pleasant dinner beforehand, Clifford & I that is.

Dearest Sylvia,
Thank you so much for your long letters.  I'm afraid by now you will have received my bad news about Birmingham.  I have not heard from Leeds and I tend to think that means I have not got onto the short list even: if I were being considered I believe I would have heard by now.  Unsuccessful candidates are always the last to hear.

Yes, I agree with your list of 'What's On': I want to see all the things you mention.  I have not been to Lansbury or Battersea myself.  You ask me to let you know what day you should go and see Muriel.  I don't know:  any time.  I am lecturing on 4th, 6th,11th, 13th, 18th, 20th, 25th, 27th at the Tate.  On Wednesdays I shall be at Banstead.  I will let you know when they start, latish in September, I think.

I am dying to see you again.  It is so long since we were together.  I feel as anxious and solitary as ever in our first year when we were apart.  Oh, dearest love, I adore you.  I cannot think how I shall wait for another two weeks or so without seeing you.

That is good news about Desirée's portrait - how nice of Clifford and how nice for Desiree.  To say nothing of your pleasure in so congenial a commission.  I am sure she will be willing to pose for Persephone and I do think that you have made a very interesting piece of 'casting'.  You will do for Persephone what you have done for the Flight, beguiling the myth into new forms.

You are quite right about Horton who is, in non-popular directions, rather rationalistic.  In fact the editor of Athene cut out one or two fines and highers as it was.  He also thinks in terms of cliches about abstraction:  retreat from reality, and all that.

Do ask your mother-in-law about producing Virginia Dent though I am doubtful of her reaction when she reads it.  I think your idea of sending it to French kindly met but somewhat over hopeful.  It is rather like submitting a Matta to the National Portrait Gallery.  It is possible the play might be staged at John McHale's sometime - perhaps at a party.  I am glad Clifford liked it.

If Clifford was knocked down twice by the tide whatever happened to you and Desiree?  Still the fact you are able to write allays my fears.  What a sea that must have been.  I bet Clifford was furious.

What a shock to have Mary Oppenheim visit you.  What an odd opinion of hers that it was a good thing Charles had not married a film-star type.  I suppose she means good for the film-star type!

Dearest Sylvia,
I do hope that the weather has allowed you to make a start on 
the Cricket-Field gate - that charming and picturesque subject. 
Here the days start fine and usually turn rainy or even stormy
in the evening, or late afternoon. So, perhaps, you will have
been able to paint out of doors during the day.

Father and I started the Festival in light and in dry weather,
ending up at 10.30 in darkness and heavy rain. The site is,
however, delightful at night - you must see it, then. We went
 round almost in order (getting lost here and there) and it is an
advantage: just as Shenstone used to complain if anyone came
into his vista from the wrong end, so the designers have often
stressed one aspect. Father enjoyed it: so did I again; and
I anticipate happily seeing it again with you.

My parents have invited me to Wimbledon on Friday to see Occupe
Toi d'Amelie again and with it is Top Hat, which we saw at StTreat-
ham a little while ago. If my lectures are in hand, as they say,
I think I shall go. I must see how my work goes, though.

Thank you for reading the early Tudor chapter: I am relieved
and happy that you approve, my dearest. I have a picture of the
Apollo on the Arch: Parsons has it at present but you shall see it
soon. What a pleasure to me that it has turned your mind again
to your play. No, no hurry with the MSS.

I have been working on Blake - so feel defiantly trivial and

Yesterday's lecture was, I think, successful: afterwards I went
to sea with a Swiss man who has a charming collection. Toulouse-
Lautrec drawing, oils by Fantin Latour, Lepine, Guys drawing, and
the centre of the collection - of any private col., - a late oil
by Turner of Venice. He picked it up in an auction room for what
can only be described as £6 10s. It is authentic alright. It 
is superb. It has no provenance so I am going to try and get the
sale room to give information (they are furious and won't speak to
him) by writing on N.G. notepaper. I made his acquaintance 
through my lectures which he constantly attends. He tells me
M. Douglas Cooper is going to live in France, near Avignon.

I just had time to look in on Paul (between S Pancras 
Liverpool St.). As I suspected he has not yet written to you
but he is about to. Even so, I may be first with the news.
He is very excited at the news of your joint exhibition but
there are two possible obstacles. One is the money: he is not
sure of raising £30, being very doubtful of his father in
this case. The other difficulty is that he may (repeat MAY) get a
designing job which would not leave him much time for painting
and he has not enough good-enough work at the moment. Despite
the [unclear]promises[/unclear] he is very interested indeed & the job he has in
mind will be settled, one way or the other, early next week.
He has had a very lean time for the last month or so - not
painting but designing - often being short of money. He even thought of going back to S. Africa for a time (food & sunshine).
He & I are going to have lunch at Wimbledon on Sunday & we shall
talk it over in detail. If possible he will [unclear]show[/unclear] - he want
to if he can. He adores the oil you gave him more & more & has

   Lion is writing in the drawing room - your enchanting Venetian watercolor on the wall facing me. How it reminds me of those afternoons sitting on the steps of St Maria Maggiore, a few inches above the water slapping the stone languidly.
   Yesterday, after the lecture (at least 70 people), Father took me to see Dieu à besoin des hommes (which in English means Isle of Sinners!). I enjoyed it enormously. Pierre Fresnay plays brilliantly the man in a primitive Breton community who, tho' lay, takes on the duties of priest when the 'barbarity' of the islanders makes the pastor leave in protest.  His conflict of respectful superstition and 'spiritual pride' is touchingly handled (tho' perhaps Clifford would not be very sympathetic). He is forced to confess someone, absolves them, and, finally, is almost forced to the sacrilege of mass. Then a pastor comes but the islanders prefer the layman: 'what we tell you goes straight to God - not back to the mainland', as one sinner puts it. 'Lying to the police is not a sin' the 'lay' priest tells them: no wonder they prefer him. Jean Delannoy (who directed L'Éternel Retour) made the film.
   I have not got your letter here so I cannot answer the points in it ( I will in my next letter) but, thank you so much for your long letter.
   The Tate have some new acquisitions not yet on view: a hideous Lucien Freud and some new Sironis - I believe of the kind that we saw in Milan & admired so much.

   The weather does not seem to have broken as we feared so I hope that you enjoy being back at Pett with your garden and the country in Spring.  I hope the wind has not greatly ruffled the blossoms in the orchard:  the trees in Blackheath are mostly alright I noticed this morning.
   Mother, although fibrositis (spelling?) has followed her rash, gave me a very nice dinner last night:  ham, hard-boiled eggs, cucumber, tomatoes, lettuce, beetroot, new potatoes and no less that 3 kinds of home-made tarts.

There is a nice Wesley chapel of the 1830s in the manner you taught me to appreciate - Greek and Egyptian. It is very neat and compact: behind it and up the hill is the colossal cathedral, diffuse and grand. It is marvellously sited. (and amusing contrast of architecture and faith.)

Dearest Sylvia,

I am surrounded by books and papers and notes but
as my typewriter is out and I keep thinking of you
I must just stop work for a few minutes and write to
you. I hope that you are really rested now, that the
good night you mentioned in a recent letter has not
been isolated, and, also, that you are not worried 
about your show. I am sure it will be a success and
I am looking forward to it very much indeed. Once it
has started I am sure that you will be happy, too.

I have written to Gabriel White to see if he will
let me do some Mexican lectures: it is not in the 
hands of Mary Chamot. White will have to consult with
the Mexicans, I believe, who are being very exact and
careful about everything connected with their exh. No
casual Spanish exuberance, it seems.

I hope you do not mind that Pasmore may be here on
Thursday morning but he is going away for a bit and
then I am, and it was one of the few chances to see him,
and I need to see him for the article. Questions to 
ask and so on. (If you can possibly lend me £1 on
Thursday, by the way, it will be gratefully received. 
As usual I am waiting for cheques but I do not expect
anything until Friday, when I think Banstead Art Group 
will pay cash.)

At present I am writing about films (something called
'groupthink'), art and the machine, Pasmore, and getting a Constable lecture ready. Poems are coming in 
bits and pieces, too. (I rather wish no-one was coming this evening for I am working well and would not mind
going on till bedtime.)

The new Burlington is interesting. Have you had a 
chance to look over the articles on the Dutch exh.? As
Robert said: it is a waste of money to buy the catalogue,
there are so many errors of attribution.

Only 8 rooms apart from Matisse at the T.G. are open at the moment so I
shall have to get new lectures ready, I think, for Thursday and Saturday. Tomorrow (Constable) is all right, 
fortunately. Many of the upstairs galleries are being 
used for storage as the basements could be flooded any 
time until the 27th. After that it is safe I think.

Now, darling, I shall go and post this. I do love,

Thank you for your letter thank you for getting it to me so quick. I was so pleased to hear from you so soon (Saturday evening it came) because I have felt very low since you went: depressed by day and sleepless by night. I am glad that you slept pretty well - I hope you may continue to do so.

I am reassured that C's injuries are comparatively slight. I adore your story about him in the wheelchair. I laughed out loud when I read it. (It still makes me chuckle as I re-read it.)

How is MM's Zulieka Dobson treatment? Have you read it - are you expected to? I hope you have time for a few conversations with him. MM makes me think of the movies that reminds me I couldn't book for The General tonight so M I will have to queue for 45 minutes or so to see it. I expect he will be willing to.

Delighted to hear that Pett is receiving its share of rain.

Yes, I found some useful lit at the ICA - including a fascinating paper (about the size of an entire VOGUE) on the museum at Saõ Paulo. I hope to finish the syllabus this morning in time for M's comments.

CJ gave me lunch and told me about his trip. He seems to have worked hard tho he neglected (according to my standards) the Mondrians at [unclear][/unclear].

I was right about the weather.  I have sunbathed all day, reading a book at the same time.  Mind and body have thus benefited.  And this morning your letter came to soothe and to pleasure me.  The Hôtel des Etrangers is celebrated for having housed Rimbaud for a time; he was being supported by a musician who, [unclear]however[/unclear], threw him out when Rimbaud pissed in the bottle of ([unclear]bourgeois[/unclear]) milk he had left every morning.  Rimbaud to Apollinaire: how I envy you les [unclear]enamelles[/unclear] de Tiresias.  I wish I could explain it, but I know very little about it, alas.  I'm sure it amply compensated for 'Tosca'.

I remember when some of your letters used to be written in the Hastings Reference Library. Mine, today is being written in the B.M. The immense dome of the reading room rises above me. The B.M. clock has just struck eleven. I think it is fast. I make it only five minutes to. Sunlight is breaking in here despite a very bad start. What is it like at Pett? We have had two winterish days. What, I wonder, are you doing at this time? The students and scholars around me are rather depressing and I am confirmed in my resolve not be become a permanent art historian. I must devote myself to poetry for a while when Hogarth is done. I feel with you as my subject inspiration is inexhaustible. I have got the Panovsky references to Titian and I will include them in my next letter. They are very rich in poetic suggestions. On Saturday I went through a ten years file of Burlington Magazines and noted several articles and letters and attributions about [unclear]Giorgions[/unclear] over the years. You must not neglect that source of information. In one Kenneth Clark quotes from Tebaldo. I went to Hampton Court yesterday with Dennis and in three hours we had only got as far round as the Kent dining hall we studied the pictures so closely. One day I'd like to give a talk on [unclear]Iacopo[/unclear] Barano. You know Johnson sold me 50 Swiss francs - worth about £2..18. He wanted to charge me £3..10 - apparently because it was a semi-black market deal. He didn't say frankly he wanted to make 12s. out of 70s. from me but called it a 'fair price'. I protested and he said he didn't want to haggle but gave me 55 of the £3..10 rate which was better! What do you think of that? I must stop now and I shall post this at lunch time. I hope for news from you, my love.

Dearest Sylvia,

I break off from typing The Election chapter to send you a little news of your lion.  First you may like to know I have finished the Industry and Idleness chapter and shall finish the one on which I am now engaged in an hour or so.  

All this typing has taught me one thing: namely, the difference in spelling between similar and familiar which I can now write without confusion.

I see from an old newspaper that one teatime, in Devon, an owl flew out of chimney, bit a lady on the chin, and, then, made good its escape.  I am sure you have a story for me:  what was behind his action?  Which owl was it?  Sounds like a new one.  Tell me do.

I saw Murillo's Pool of Bethesda at the N.G. yesterday.  It is a brand new acquisition and not yet on view to the public.  It has been cleaned and though not as good as the Barber Institute one is first rate and has life-size figures.

Fragnonard's Fete, in the Gulbenkian collection, has been cleaned and is now delicious and strangely evocative.  

Talking of pictures, [unclear]Mayman's[/unclear] Lions Leap Frogging was sold for £28.  It is not as good as either the V & A examples but it is attractive, important, nonetheless.  Only £28...

And still talking of pictures I am glad you made the decision to submit some pictures to these various shows.  Let me know about the Kensington Gallery: I will take your things if necessary with pleasure.  Soon, my cat, you will be making your reputation.  I shall tell the hundreds of lions and I think they will buy one for the Art Gallery in their town.  You have not told me about one but I'm sure they have a very good one.

The trees are much more out here now, including the line of trees across the road, cutting off the factories.  The beech tree is rather advanced also.  

I am going to work every minute of Friday so do, my darling, my rose, write me a nice encouraging letter to come that morning.  I shall work so much more happily and have, perhaps, everything done when we next meet.

Dearest Sylvia,

I hope you will be able to make a start on your painting
soon :  your letter sounds enthusiastic and fills me with hope
that you will work well.  Hetty, of course, is with you to
act as Muse but Dandy will look after himself, he promises.

It is early Tuesday morning and soon I must be off for my
morning lecture.  I stayed at Wimbledon until Monday morning
because I could not leave immediately Father had given me £50.
I shall be debtless in a few days:  we shall be able to walk
round the village freely, now.  Bernard Gay came to Wimbledon
on Sunday and took away some books in payment for his mobile:
so it is our mobile, now.

Miss Chick has written to ask me to lecture (provisionally)
for a week in March.  If I can only add a few more such engagements ahead things won't be too bad.

Here is a sonnet (alas, unrhymed) for you, my beauty, my
Muse:

The eremetical attributes
With which I strew the hollow cave,
Are blue as unconsoling walls
The sky erects in empty shires
Between this solitude and your
Rural Victorian retreat:
Blue thoughtful skull, blue book and bell,
Eyes in a mirror left by you.

In the black plain, beyond the cross,
Beyond the precincts of the ferns - 
Soft as lingerie folded by the wind,
Blue neon models swaying clouds
Near the tower by the canal
And the almost stationary clock.

(Your hermit lion, and your blue neoned Mazawatee factory.)

There is a newly cleaned Cuyp belonging to the King in the N .G .

After a night in which I had complicated and anxious dreams about the PRB I have woken to the shining crystal of day which has 4 facets, one for each page of your letter.

You say you may be able to come on Friday - that would be marvellous. However, I shall, as Coleridge recommended - 'suspend belief' until you actually say when you are coming definitely. Be sure I will met you whenever it is.

I am amused to hear that Desirée and Carol are now small [unclear]sees[/unclear] - in every way but the essential ones, of course. You should be flattered and not in the least ashamed. No - on re-reading your letter it must be Mary Jane or Carol who are imitating you - for you describe them both as 'rapatious' (rapacious) and that Desirée never is.

Isn't it fantastic about the Kensington Gallery show! They are all paying something towards it, of course. CJ & Poyser have sent me cards but I have no intention of reviewing it. Moronic Rayner-Bonham to leave out Madeleine and yourself! I kept my article as a surprise for my cat - I felt a reader of ART NEWS needed surprises!

Savage reminds me of the art-dealer in Samuel Foote's Taste: 
CANTO 'the very mutilations of this piece are worth all the most perfect performances of modern artists'.
NOVICE 'Great! Amazing! Divine! I'm ravished! Transported! So decent! So grave! - is it a man or a woman?'

and later on
'How the devil would we distinguish the works of the Ancients if they were perfect'.

The bust's nose is missing:
CANTO 'The nose itself without the head, in another's possession, would be an estate'. But here are an Equestrian Statue of Marcus Aurelius without the horse & a complete statue of the emperor Trajan with only the head & legs missing'.

Today you will be painting Desiree. I am sure that will be enjoyable. I shall be getting my lectures ready, then this evening I am going to the Rex to see a war film and a western (War Correspondent & Hell Town)

My dearest Sylvia,

Thank you so much for your letter: what a catalogue of delights it was though my first impression was simply joy at seeing your handwriting again. I am writing this reply immediately and so have not looked at all the buildings you mentioned in what architecture books I have but I intend to later this evening: I shall, of course, place you in every photogravure foreground. Your account of the Uffizi was very poignant: one does respond like that sometimes to so much beauty. As you say everything needs a superlative to describe it and I can only respond with conventional but heartfelt agreement. Donatello's Judith. Oh, oh. And your description of discovering the Annunciata plus Brunelleschi's Hospital is delightful. And, thank you, for remembering mannerists for me: I hope to God you manage to tell J.C. about them before he lectures at the N.G. on them. I am glad that it is not unbearably hot: we have been lucky here incidentally and it was nearly ninety ˚ today. (N.C. thermometer registered 87 by 2 o'clock.) I liked your choice of expression about 'searching out hidden Bronzino's' for that sums up the position of mannerism, as well as the hanging of the pictures in galleries. I am interested the Uffizi is so good for pictures - I feared it would be rather dark. 

I have stroked Pablo for you and he gave a delicious shudder, raised his head, and then relaxed on the carpet again, purring, and stretching his front paws. That is, he thanks you for your kind thought. Molly is still away but Iris says she is very well (she is, however, pro-Ricky): she will be back next week. Charles has been there quite a bit, taking her her breakfast in bed and arranging the tray with great care I understand, also from Iris. I received a dreadful shock from Iris: I ought to be immured, I suppose, but after talking about Existentialism I asked what she was interested in at present in the same line and she replied Telepathy, that one could get into touch (if I have it right and I fear I have) with minds like Leonardo's... Did I tell you, despite such disasters as the above, she got Distinction in the exam? To visit the N.G. at the moment is to imagine oneself back in the Louvre because all the visitors one notices are French - all types except for the abominable middle-class which one is spared.

The children who spend all their time here saw me writing a poem
to you (recognised the shape) and arranged a poetry recital for me.
They arranged themselves on the stage at one end of the hall.  One
boy (Norman) claimed to know 15 pieces but when challenged pro-
duced 2 and a bit.  Two little girls recited together, one with her
arms twisted behind her head, the other rotating one leg with
embarrassment.  However the desire to please was stronger than
shyness & they completed the poem.  Almost all were inaudible
but Janet, one of 2 of the name, started well with

The rest was lost however when she was overcome & had to
turn her back on me and press against the wall in utter confus-

One boy, John, has a crush on me.  He is 11 or 12 and is, it
must be admitted, semi-deficient.  He plays, not with his
contemporaries but 7 and 8 year old girls.  He resents time I 
spend with anyone else and I had to reproach him the other day
for fighting with a 7 year old girl (for my favours).  He be-
came sullen and slouched round & round the hall (in very heavy 
boots) whistling on one ear-splitting note.  I expelled him but
he comes in still, chastened, but marvelling. Incidentally
the children are not in at present because Saturday afternoon
they go to the pictures: they will be in after tea, I imagine , though.
I am going to dismantle the exhibition tonight at about 6
o'clock.  I can't believe that tomorrow I shall not have to answer
questions about 'detail' and 'realism' and 'beauty'.  What will remain
on the walls of memory - if I live to be 23 - are the superb, the un-
forced, cliches.
The visitors here, & I've had more than a hundred in 8 
days - are never at a loss for nonsense or vulgarity: they have a
commonplace at every finger tip.  They have no individuality but a
marvellously effective collective identity - if 'identity' is not

Pupils are all women, & all (but one adolescent) are 40 and considerably over. This was the 3rd week : still life was their theme - & previously they had produced abstractions. There is an odd rarity of phallic symbols : on the whole the ladies prefer petal forms and layers of colour folding back . . . One exception is Mrs Cunningham (a single lady, now, who is school mistress & lives where I do) who turned a drapery into a superb prick. The pictures are spontaneous, individual, & unself-conscious which is a great thing. (Women are much more sensible & sensitive than the men= not only do fewer men come in the ones that do are usually inferior to their wives.) The standard of work is really excellent. The teacher (who is all breasts & bottom & a buttoned - up raincoat) guides without interfering. 
This morning I went to Hampstead, invited by the Rev. Cecil Russell, a cultivated man with a pleasant wife, & he showed me his church. I had borrowed Mrs. Cunningham's bicycle for the journey so I was relieved to see a 13 foot image of St Christ-opher when I went in. I knew I was safe from disaster now. The saint is one of numerous C13th to C14th wall paintings : crucifixion, Last Supper, Entombment, Judgment, &c., not all equally visible. They make a fine covering for the early english nave walls. Beyond this feast there is a superb Baroque monument, with a free standing figure in white marble kneeling before it & gesturing piteously at her dead brothers & sisters: it is very large and rich. There is a signed Flaxman monument, an interesting collection of early C18th [unclear]natchments[/unclear], a C17 Scots cape, a charming register starting in 158 something, &c, &c. It is most rich and it would have been rich had not the plate all been given, with much else, to the cause of Charles the Martyr as he is described in a small chapel I was delighted to see set by for him. The roundheads were kept out of the church. Hamstead is totally rural. When Russell enquired of a labourer about a local custom (many of which he incorporates with the symbolic games usual in church) and asked, 'was it old?' he told. 'I don't know about that, sir, it's 800 years old.' Oh, & there is an C18th bible with a map of The Garden of Eden & 'circumfacent countries'.",0.6666666667,FALSE

Dearest Sylvia
I will tell you first about the lecture. The resistance I had expected I did not encounter and, emboldened, 
I even ventured a little way onto psychoanalytical
interpretation - of one [unclear]Ernst[/unclear] and one Mirò. I read them
Trava's lion Tamer, automatic texts by Picasso, poems by
[unclear]Perot[/unclear], Eluard and Mirò himself. They honestly seemed
persuaded when I said - orthodox surrealism - that everybody could be a surrealist - Mrs Jarvis even admitting
she could write such poems if she tried to. The husband of one
of the women came and seemed himself interested in
what was going on: in the discussion when I mentioned
the resistance surrealism often aroused he compared
it to [unclear](super-ego)[/unclear] laws about bathing, etc. I took along
many books and did not leave until almost 10 o'clock
I had them admiring Alice Paalen, Esteban Francés, as well
as the more familiar earlier surrealists. It is curious
how swiftly they respond to colour. One woman brought along some Horizons with surreal illustrations to
pass about - which was very kind, I thought.
On the way - actually at Morden - I entered for
a time to an election meeting (a conservative): it was a 
curious occasion and one I was fascinated by. The sky
was getting appreciably darker & great clouds were rearing up from the horizon - as from a burning city. Great

formation of domestic subjects by expressive exaggeration of light 
and colour parallels Mallarmé's 'idealism which rejects natural materials and an exact thought ordering them as too brutal'.  We are reminded 
of the transformation of console table, vase, curtains, in Mallarmé's
sonnets of the later '80s.  Berthe Morisot's discreet hints at 
generalised psychological states of maternity or virginity, her

Dearest Sylvia, Last night I typed out two new poems of one hundred lines each and found a foolscap envelope for them but find this morning I have no stamps.  So, I will send you tomorrow the poems, and, for today, content myself with this letter.  My German lecture was quite satisfactory, and included a fine rhetorical passage - purple - on the wonderful new Michel Pacher, which I enthusiastically examined.  My Worringer Form in Gothic notes came in useful at last (Made for the Munich lectures, you remember) and, afterwards, one of the audience was about to dash off to Zwemmer to try and buy it.  Charles wants me to give the first three lectures during September, also: he wanted to do Rembrandt but I resisted and he made it Velasquez instead.  I had a letter from Miss Chick who is secretary of the S.E.A. (Society for Education in Art): she wonders, it is still provisional, at an early stage, and 'subject to the approval of her committee', whether I might not be able to edit the society's magazine Athene.  The present editor is retiring.  I should not be paid a salary but would receive, apparently, a 'gift' of  £25 annually.  I am going to see her next week about it but, of course it is too early to be too confident though I am flattered at being asked.  Melville told me a little more about Schmanski's death: apparently the aeroplane he was in, with other journalists, just exploded in the air.  One body, not his, was recovered.  Dearest Cat, what of your shoes?  I hope they have arrived safely by now.  If not tell me and I will go to Chieseman's.  I am reading News of the World:  I admire it less than Eros in Dogma but nonetheless it contains much that is excellent.  Barker's tendency to be hysterically sad is rather a bore but I think the book worth reading though not, not in the least, important.  I hope you enjoyed Canterbury.

Dearest Sylvia -
     I thought of you all over the week-end, struggling
with the greenwoods. I hope you can release now.
I must apologize for writing no more than this
hasty note now but I am preparing my Tuesday
morning lecture and still have good deal to
do, and must return shortly to the gallery.
     My father has agreed to let me have a cheque
for £50, which is, I think, very kind indeed. I feel
very glad and grateful about this. They have
given me chocolate, tinned meat, & butter from
France, and 2 tiny bottles of liqueur - Benedic-
tine & cherry brandy, which we shall drink when
you come.
    I love you and think of you so strongly, while
I work in the day, and before I sleep at night. I
have written a good deal of another 100 line poem,
which I will send  you soon - my dazzling Muse -
how you inspire me to write!
     I hope you can paint this week - I love you.
I will write more fully tomorrow.

Blackheath

Dearest Sylvia,

Alas, my return to Blackheath, though it brought a delightful letter from you, did not provide sufficient cheques for you to come here, yet. Gainsborough has paid me four guineas for my article but that is not enough to make it worth your journeying here. I will let you know immediately, immediately, when you can come. How I long for it to be soon.

I am enchanted by your drawing of Wassily at work: if only I had had it sooner it would have been lovely to introduce my Artist at Work lecture. I admire very much the vigour of her pose and her captivating smock. It is a lovely sketch which makes Dandy very happy and full of smiles. (How well you draw cats.)

Thursday I went to Norwich: I saw the cathedral in great detail (it has a marvellous array of bosses, many of them freshly cleaned and painted in the largest cloisters in England so nice and low), including the Retable of the Passion by an English artist, some of which is reproduced in Gothic England. The museum itself interested me very much also, especially the lavish selection of Cotman and the dozen or so Cromes. I have little books about cathedral and pictures to show you when, in the near future, we are able to be together again.

Friday, as you know I had a lecture and, in the evening, the Anglo-Dutch party at Wimbledon, which I mildly enjoyed at first, but as it dragged on I became very tired (after my tour) and so became like a Bronzino personage from one O'clock on.

Saturday I had two lectures which were I think successful and in the evening Charles took m to dinner and the cinema. (By the way, I saw some Constables in the N.G. basement, back from the Bienalle, including the Waterloo Bridge one which is glorious.) We saw Le Beauté du Diable, which is, on the whole, a tiresome, though pretty, version of Faust, by René Clair. Decorative but feeble, and full of loose ends as no fable should be.

Today I am happy to stay in my flat, except for posting this letter, with nothing pressing to do, except rest. And think of you. I expect you will have finished your painting now and I am interested to hear of your perfecting of Tiny's portrait. It must be splendid indeed now. And the savage's arm? I am sure that will soon, if it does not already, please you.

Here is the Orphée article. I have found a few more pieces of evidence to add to your fundamental ideas. I hope you approve of them, my muse. It is exactly the relation of muse & poet according to G.

Dearest Sylvia,

     I have been working rather hard so today I am going to take it
easy. I have cleaned the flat: that perhaps is not taking it
easy but it was getting very dusty and I feel relaxed having done
it. Then I have just stepped from a bath. It is about 11:00 in
the morning. Tomorrow I must start work on the pre-Raphaelites -
but not until tomorrow. Tuesday's lecture is on the 18th portraiture -
which needs little preparation: I am including Wright's Brooke
Boothby. Thursday's is on the pre-Raphaelites and that is the
one which is something of a problem. Thursday is the 13th September so perhaps I'll have the pleasure of seeing you in the audience then: if not, I expect I shall meet you that day. I could
get to Lewisham, if you're coming by bus, by 5 o'clock. Banstead,
by the way, begins on Wednesday 19th - the day of the I.C.A. discussion about Read so I shall not be there after all. (At least I 
won't have to read Education Through Art, which I was dreading.)

     I have only one overdue library book. Is that a record? I
have read Finberg's Turner and Mona Wilson biography of Blake.
I have also glanced through Wertheim's Show of Violence, but found
it terribly badly written and crudely popular. Otherwise I suppose it is alright. You know what Valéry says: 'It is by no means 
the mischievous who do most harm in this world. It is the awkward,
the negligent and the credulous'. Hetty is hoping to make a sampler with this on it. Yawolla has made an effort to learn it but he
keeps mixing it up. Lionel chuckled appreciatively and capped it with
something in Greek. Valéry's aphorism makes one terribly impatient with most of the books one has to read in the course of duty,
getting lectures ready and so on. I have been snatching time to
read René Char again: have I quoted this to you before -

     My own poems are progressing well but I am afraid I have not had
sufficient leisure to prepare them for my cat's eyes yet. It is still
growing spasmodically, fragment by fragment, and it is too early to
control it. I think it will be a sequence of shortish poems
rather than one long one. Beyond that I am in the dark. Are you
not a mysterious muse (working in mysterious purrs).

      I shall eat and sleep at Wimbledon tonight (conveniently near the
V and A where I shall be Saturday) but not before I have tea with
John McHale. That means I shall see the two films I mentioned -
including Top Hat: o I wish you were to be there with me. But

missing you. Dearest love, you are my life.

Wimbledon
Dearest Sylvia,

I attempted to write a letter to you in the train yesterday but the movement was too wild. When I reached London I phoned my parents & found that father was in hospital and that he is having his operation on Monday (today). [unclear]Mother[/unclear]was alone - so here I am, staying at [unclear]Namel[/unclear] Road for a couple of days. Last night, of course, I went to visit father intending to return home. But, if all goes well (& there is no reason to doubt it), I'll be home on Tuesday - I hope so for I find I am irritable & anxious without news of you (though your nice long letter at Thom's - which I got Friday - cheered me up & soothed me).

My cold is bad: not only is it [unclear]nasal[/unclear], I have (imitative lion that I am) neuralgia on the right side of my face, too. Too many journeys & changes of temperature have brought my cold back - & worse, I'm afraid. In a way Wimbledon is good for me as there are medicines ([unclear]avondynes[/unclear]) & [unclear]rum[/unclear] (in hot milk). But I want to get home once I've seen father tomorrow after the operation. There are 2 lectures on Wednesday which I cannot shirk - N.G. at 2 and, then, [unclear]Banstead[/unclear].

Diss was a successful lecture, I think, & afterwards I stayed in a large C16th manor owned by the Rash's - the lady of whom is novelist Doreen Wallace & a Norfolk annalist. We got on very well & she gave me one of her [unclear]books[/unclear] & an invitation to return in the future. She is a jolly talkative woman in her 50s - owns most of Wortham (the village near Diss). But she feels a bit isolated from congenial people: everybody's got something wrong, - even when you're loaded & own a village!

Any ideals for an Xmas short story: 3000 words & £250. My parents have found a competition to that effect & suggested I try. I thought I might go about the way Poe claims to have set to write The Raven. (I must look up his analysis - tho' I must try to get a [unclear]slightly[/unclear] different answer). 

I will write again tomorrow. I love you I love you

I look forward to meeting you on Thursday morning. I will check myself the time of your bus' arrival at Lewisham.
I had not repressed the fact you were visiting M. what you had repressed from me however is the fact it was a week-end. I thought it was simply for a day.
About seeing the Greenwoods: £3 will not support us very long. Here are some dates. You arrive on 6th. We have the 7th together, then you go to Cambridge. I don't know when you will be back but anyway by Monday 10th for Clifford's lecture. Tuesday 11th I have a Tate lecture at 3.00 & a Petersfield lecture at 7.30. I believe I must stay the night. Banstead on Wednesday 12th. Perhaps you can come back on Sunday night which would give us more time because you might (unless a cheque comes) have to go about Tuesday 11th. Should you  say that provisionally ...
Zadkine's sculptures tho' interesting and attractive are not I think first rate. He is so clever with chiaroscuro that his concavities really look like the real thing sometimes. His lecture was a bit pat and somewhat elevated but it contained some exciting bits and he is a bubbling, eloquent little man (tiny) who sweeps one along with him, at least partially. I saw several other exhibitions yesterday too but nothing worth recording. 
The War Film article is not finished yet but next weekend I shall complete it. The I.C.A. are showing Le Song d'un poet at the end of the month. If possible you must be here and we shall see it together.
Love you

Your letter, describing your lack of sleep, fits me too. How I wish we were together the whole time, my love, my muse.

My father has given me a ring - smaller than perhaps is our ideal but admirable all the same: it was given to him by his mother about 36 years ago. It is gold with a bloodstone (dark green, red-flecked) = about this size.
I have been improving my Sound Barrier article in the way that you suggested and am now on my way to the V and A (or nearly).
I am so glad that you are interested warmly, in your lecture : I am sure it will be absolutely brilliant. I have learned much from you already. I have found a nice book in the library, by the way, a recent study of The Dance = French Literature = Gautier, Mallarmé, Valéry, Cocteau on the dance. I shall use it in my Degas lecture at Hastings. Also it is useful for my Cocteau film chapter - clarifying some things. 
I gather you will go this evening to the lecture of Modern Art. I do hope it is not absurd. Tell me all about it my love & I hope that you enjoy yourself - perhaps you will . . .

Speaking of illness, poor Monica (at the Tate) has not been

sent, she is suffering with a period which, instead of coming once a month, has listed for over a month. Her doctor
seems unable to stop it.

Dearest Sylvia,

I love the look of your painting from your sketch. As you say- my kind of composition. That, combined with your kind of color, will produce a really splendid picture. How busy you are, with the watercolor and the nude going at the same time.

How busy you are socially, too. Your time-table for Saturday is terrific. Did you enjoy 'Venice Preserv'd'? But I'm sure you did. I must say I envy you seeing that. 

I am glad- though not really surprised- that your father liked the mustard pot. He couldn't fail to, it is so nice. He seems to have responded very gallantly to your birthday. Tell me, when you untied the fine bow- were there chocolates inside as you suspected...

I have been working hard, writing and interviewing sculptors. I have seen Adams again (to get photographs) and, also, Geoffrey Clarke. Tomorrow night I have a chance to meet Kenneth Armitage who will be in town then: I have labouriously uncovered his movements.

Thank you for your letters.  Your first one came on Thursday and the second one today.  I saw the top of the [unclear]Maga-watel[/unclear] Building this morning as I came up to town and I was possessed by the strongest thoughts of you.

Yesterday afternoon - to answer your kind, urgent enquiries - I saw Gainsborough and reviewed for him the new London Gallery exhibition - Estéban Francés.  I took it to him this morning (so that it will be in the next issue): he seemed very amiable so you need not fear, I think about my being left out of Art News contributors.

I'm sorry to say I saw absolutely nothing in The Third Man I had not seen before.  Your Trinity suggestion is true but does it relate to my interpretation of the symbolism of the film significantly?  I have worked many of your observations into the article.  Thank you for your encouragement and help.

This afternoon I am going to The Arts Council (John's place, that is) to draft an improved version of the exhibition.

    Here is a sonnet for you:  I wrote it this morning after breakfast, a few minutes ago.

        Sunbath or sleepless night subscribe relief,
        Or fail to spark the phoenix in his clay:
        The accidents of time and place occur
        Like brambles active distant from their roots,
        That seem irrelevant.  Desire depends
        On object not on symbols.  My desire
        Is naturalistic to a fault and bribes
        No re-assuring counterpart or ghost.
        Therefore the plans upon the window-ledge
        Are hard or sleepy, not equivalent
        To the taste of love's original:
        Despite the claims of transference the room
        Defeats the symbol with cool enmity
        And longs to be the background of our love.

I love you, Lawrence

Afterwards we had dinner and on the menu was, for the first time since Italy, the word cassata:  you can imagine I was only restrained from starting with one with difficulty.

Remark, incidentally, the opening paragraph of Isaac's Thornhill article.  Cadbury's Rococo...

Dearest Sylvia
Your letter today pleases me and makes me happy to have so spirited a communication from my love though I am sorry to hear you were tired & that the weather has frustrated your creative efforts to some extent.  Aren't the Leicester Galleries silly - not to make your landscapes centre-piece for the 1st show, at the very least!  I anticipate seeing your new works, even the unfinished ones, with excitement & desire.

Last night I saw Les Enfants Terribles - written but not directed with Cocteau.  It is interesting but less well acted than Orphée & shows signs of having been adapted from a novel.  Death and love and adolescence occur in a fascinating tangle but without making the impact of Orphée & lacking too its delicacy.

Here is the second section of a fairly surrealistic poem about Paris:
As the Summer turns green above the night-ferry
Winds unmask the calm of the spider's web
Spun by the afternoon across the city

A rain drop splinters on my wrist
Damp as an insect I have killed

As the rocks melt above Les Halles
The daylight collapses voluptuously
Silver skewers varnish the trays of fruit

Statues of Paris in the green evening
Secure the heritage of the aubode
The blinds are terrible to the night",0.6666666667,FALSE

SUNDAY
Dearest Sylvia,
I am so sorry that my letter is late and also that 
the book is late. I intended to post the book today
but was told there's no parcel post on Sunday. I delayed the letter because I wanted to finish the enclosed poems and also because I was in doubt 
about an important point. Albert has returned
from Paris and I am going over there with him at
the end of the month for a good part of April. There
was a faint chance of going this Tuesday so I hesitated to write until I knew. I opposed this idea
strongly because of your visits to London and have
won. I should be away in the period of Easter - the
3 weeks break when there was in any case, little hope of seeing you.
Was Ditchling (or is it Ditchley, I don't remember and am not much concerned at a recurrence of the con-
fusion) pleasant - at least inoffensive? I do hope
so and that going there Friday night (alas!) didn't make 
the weekend seem too long. Although it is so  long
since I saw you it is with terrible concern I realise
anew that I am not to see you until Wednesday - &
then not alone
[Monday & Tuesday are the mountain separating me
from you & the triumphal train that will bring you on
Wednesday.]
One of the features of being in love which I don't think 
the writers have stressed enough is the feeling that one's acts 
of tenderness are incomplete, that I haven't shown 
always how I love you that everything is still to be done.

Wrestling nude on the eighth of May
And white as teeth in a recent smile
         Hello the columns

Hello the house where the doors open
On rooms of exhilarating games of chance
While giants of the sun shake the roof
         Hello the house

Hello hairdresser with secret hands
Delicate now as ever before and always
Sheilds overpowered by your charms' greeting
    Hello hairdresser

This afternoon I think I shall borrow Eric's bicycle and go to the river and have a look at some architecture on the way as well as getting the sun; there are some very pretty streets past Richmond and I may come back through Chiswick. Or I may sit in the garden. Either way my thoughts will be very roughly the same - unconnected with the decor.

I hope Michael is not too distressed now; perhaps your birthday has cheered him up - or has it provided another opportunity for melancholy? Oh dear, does that sound cool? Well, hell, why shouldn't it!

Adore you.

(You implied they were not and I must admit I did not follow that quite.)  His concern is with the continuation of Grace despite 'Sin' and its victory over 'Sin' — in several people in whom one might have expected the reverse.  The fact I consider the former an illusion and the latter desirable doesn't blind me to the fact that Waugh has traced a deep aspect of the R.C. heritage.  Like it or not.  I wasn't concerned with its value in any but the Catholic scale of things.  Technically Brideshead is a triumph.

I have been struggling with existentialism this last day or two and though making some progress a lot of what I have dimly apprehended seems to be furious running to keep in exactly the same place.  Sometimes a banal place.  This is a literal criticism.

I have Flugel's Population, Psychology, and Peace, Have you read it?  I expect you have.  I'm looking forward to it with interest.

O, that's enough chatter.  All I really want is to say that I adore you and can never tell you how much I feel about you.  Metaphors of height and depth, of tenderness and fierceness, color and shape, abstraction and detail, all fall short of the truth.  The rose is one theme but there is more.  Your double portrait will perhaps express it, this feeling so difficult to analyse.  Neither sensual nor intellectual, but a sort of simple satisfaction in your presence and I long for the 18th.

Dearest Sylvia,
Thank you so very much for, in two days, sixteen pages of correspondence.  You can imagine I think my delight. Your letters come from another world. Here in Inghilterra it might be Autumn already.  The leaves are going brown, many of them, and it has rained for two days.  I have seen one bonfire of leaves and fear more summer pyres.  With what pleasure I read of the Italian scene you may conjecture: it is an added source of joy to the fact of hearing from you.

Your query [unclear] Giorgione [/unclear] sounds most exciting and I hope it turns out to be a possible one:  I have never heard of it.  I envy you very much the Giordano ceiling:  I admire his Cupid and Psyche series at Hampton Court,  but there my knowledge, alas, [unclear] helas[/unclear] stops.  Johnson's disregard of it is typical. I congratulate you on your ""lady painter"":  I need not tell you that she is totally unknown to me but I am interested to hear all you have to say about her. Thanks for your offer of  your mannerist notes:  I shall take the earliest advantage of this that I can.
[unclear] Beccafumi[/unclear] (I have seen only one original by him) is a superb and original painter I think and you seem to have been treated to an absolute feast of his work.  I haven't thought much about Sodoma, but perhaps I can see your notes on him too so that I may learn.

The Palazzo Ravizza sounds charming:  your ceiling sounds most luxurious.  Today, in Hampton Court, I wrote a poem for you. Like so many of mine, it needs a note. The early 17th century French movement of Precicsite produced ""la carte du Tendre"" an elaborate map prepared to cover every amorous possibility or eventuality.[unclear] Iac d'indifference [/unclear], the shore of declaration, a grotto for billets-doux, etc. With that in mind and vaguely the landscape vignettes on your ceiling, I wrote this:
Vivid amorists design
To  capture by analogy

The ageless, natural ornaments

Like a labyrinth of kisses;
 A sigh trembles like a scalloped lily

I have not much time to write now as this morning I have to arrange a treasure hunt with Deirdre, go to tea with Dr Antal, and then rush back to Wimbledon for a tedious party.  But I want to send you my love and a poem which I managed to scribble down between tiresome games and the like.

     I saw three ships come sailing in:
          One, scarred with frozen spume,
     Bore a glass rose only love could win
           To colour and perfume.

     The second, from the tropic South,
            Had monkeys in the rigging,
     In the hold was fruit for lovers' mouths
             For which Kings were begging.

     The third ship brought my love to me,
               The sails reared like a phoenix,
     My love came landward from the sea,
                 An admiral from a chrysalis.

I was in a book shop in the Rue de Rivoli this afternoon,
thinking of you as usual, when I saw a book that reminded
me of you, and had to buy it.  Proust's La Prisonniere.

very tired tonight so this letter will not be finished until to-

made any decisions about the altar cloth yet? The clothes here
are admirable - the men's far more than the women's. Not in
the Champs Elysees, perhaps but here in the Latin Quarter it is
so.  The selection of films on the other hand (unlike the range of
madder and cambridge blue ties in stripes) is very poor.  I've seen 2
tedious Italian films.  London offers more - much more.

I have been to the Redfern but the pictures have not been changed since we were there - but I will go there again next week.

Yesterday I went to the opening of a new exhibition at the A/A because it was opened by Robert Melville. He gave  a delightful & penetrating little talk about abstraction $ naturalism, illuminated with erotic analogies. He asked about Hogarth.

I am going to a 'party' (maybe it will turn out to be more of a 'social evening') at the Uhlman's on Monday - which is being given for some American students due to arrive here on Sunday. I am hoping Paul [unclear]Southey[/unclear] will come - he will if he's got his fare to Hampstead.

I asked Wally and Eric to visit me on Sunday and Wally wanted to bring Charles Perry & Iris & Andre also. i was noncommittal but it seems to have happened anyway. So I shall have 4 guests on Sunday - which is a bore. They are going to bring much of the food, however. You are not the only one with useless guests, alas!

It is nearly lunch time and I am wondering if I can afford to have a Chinese lunch. Dandy is not sure but Hetty hopes to persuade him. (I must do some shopping for Sunday!)

I saw Charles for tea yesterday. It seems Sir Henry Blake asked him if I had seen [unclear]I echester's [/unclear] picture. If I had finished the book it would not be necessary and if I had not Sir Henry might be able to arrange it but did not want Charles to suggest the idea to me.

Keepership and LeRoux Emmitt Le Rouse [that is only one man] (who was also at the Tate before) has got the Deputy Keepership.

   Yesterday I went to Brighton where my father is recovering tho' with a number of rather neurotic delays.  He (as they say) is worrying about himself.  We all went to the pavilion and enjoyed that.  In the afternoon we went for a walk which included the Palace Pier.  'Elevenses' and 'tea' at Zetlands - lunch & dinner at the hotel.  All the meals were excellent.  The hotel is Mackley's, on the front, King's Street, near the West Pier.  My parents are comfortable there - do you know it?

   Famous in the forties, as a lecturer on art though her
   reputation now rests primarily on her portraits and
   landscapes in oil, in which medium she appears to have
   worked exclusively.  Of especial interest is a landscape of a gay character, variously identified, but probably 
   of Sussex, dated summer, 1948 and a portrait of an 
   unidentified post, painted, on stylistic evidence, at this 
   same period... 

   February, the interminable corridors of every surrealist
picture ever painted; March, a mass of ice and rock balanced
on the edge of a precipice which will not fall for 31 days; 
April, the number of ways that break on the shore of Cythera;
May, the extraordinary sense of crisis with which the dead
endure the centuries before judgement.  JUNE; no image at all
to do this month justice. Capitals alone satisfy.

    I hope you are not too tired after yesterday and that dreadful night-journey... My cold isn't too bad today.  I did have 
rum and lemon last night and I shall stop in for the rest of  today (it's 2-30) except for posting this letter which I am resolved
you shall have first post Monday... I am so  angry at the thought 
of having to prepare an essay for clifton-taylor; all I remember
from his lectures is you next to me, and Angelica Kauffmann when
the lights go on... Last night once when I looked at you I saw
Iris beyond: her attitude, which is NOT life-accepting, seems
externalised now, creeping out into her tight lips. (These dis-
connected sentences would get no more marks from c.t. than your
long Proustian ones.)

   Do you remember those letters of Manet's decorated with water-
colors?

One of the things I've tried to do in the poems 'about you for you' is to exclude complete understanding by another reader by using certain images that mean more to us than anyone else: thus there is a deliberate privacy at one or two points in the sequence. Here you alone will recognise the full reference. To me this means shared authorship in the poems, beyond being their subject.

Your-heart-in-me assures me that yesterday's moods of sadness have not been fatal. My-heart-in-you will tell you that my perplexity, I suppose my obtuseness, does not conflict with my adoration.

I live for Wednesday. St. Pancras is no longer my favorite terminal station. Victoria replaces it. Morning and night at 11,3 (not less prompt than your train itself in arriving) the same image occurs to me. I have just seen you at the iron gate among the anonymous extras. I love you.

My dearest Sylvia

   I cannot possibly communicate my raptue this
morning when I received your letter.  Today is the 
8th and by chance your letter was dated the 8th,
too, so that an effect of magical speed made it-
self felt at once.  The barrier of space dissolved,
and there was the greet sheet, blue behind your blue
ink written with a soft flexible line, and yet domin-ated by your rose, burning with an intensity almost 
alarming.  As I looked I marveled for with the pale
blues of the page the hue of red is so strong as to defy
the idea that the rose has been actually painted. You
have caught so beautifully the furry-velvety feel
of the dark rose and the sensual folds which sug-
gest weight, the hardness of the core.  I am so pleased
that roses have a longer span than I imagined: it is
the result of learning about them via Carew, Euch-
ling, Ronsard.

   Delightful too is your pale, delicate image of Belle,
pink, green, yellow, picking up in a different order the main tints
of our rose.  I remember of course the angle of her head,
and the lovely forward movement of her body which you 
have captured perfectly.

   Across the long undulating folds of her dress you write
that R. C.s are not concerned with death because they are con-
cerned also with 'eternity.'  But surely that is the importance
they give death, the moment of transition: [unclear]E. W. anglos[/unclear] Catholics
it is a matter of high importance that an erring member of the 
family be given the benefit of a priest in his last moments
fearing that his repentance will otherwise go un-recognized -
by God as well as man.  Surely it is you and I who deny any
importance to death in our (what can I call it?) amiable hed-",0.5,FALSE

    Today I am going to see the Renoirs at Lefévre. Vuillard I'm afraid will not be seen by me, as admission is 2s. 6D. and I doubt Lefévre prestige will get me in free as it used too. However, I saw much of him in Paris. By the way: Vuillard Clifford, Sartre, reminds me. The new Sartre play opens at the Lyric Hammersmith next week (15th or 16th) and I intend to see it at least once before coming to Pett on the 18th. So I shall have some news of it when I come.
    How I love you. Even Fureli reminds me of you now. The associations that link you with me are becoming more and more numerous. more and more direct. Surely in this way Sartre's theory of the unavailability of one person to another is invalidated. Your personality is present in the poetry I have written lately/ My sensibility is in part taken over by yours. On more exactly 'my sensibility is being added to, & thus altered, by yours? This I think is literally true and by no means a conceit as enlargement of truth.

I am desolate that you should be unhappy, darling. Desolate,
too, that Italy has not, as we naively hoped, made any difference
in the situation. Michael seems orientated toward his own and your
unhappiness. How your letter wrung my heart - ""anxiety imprisons love"",
I feel quite desperate. It seems Michael will always be there to threatened with reprisals our pleasures together. I fear, for you, what he
will do, on your return, after the 10th. Ought I, I wonder, to be
willing to drop the arrangement in view of your subsequent suffering?
If you believe it is necessary tell me and I shall understand - though
I hope of course that you will come on the 10th - I hope more than I can
say. Do let me know soon, one way or the other, as I fear I shall be
unable to find accommodation if your answer is a delicious, to me, yes.

Thank you for the time-table. (Perhaps I will come to Tonbridge
by bus.) Do you need the time-table back for your own movements? If
so, tell me and I'll copy times down.

I am happy about your work in oils and delighted that you are
going to start adding to your Giorgione which is already considerable. I will look up the full details of the Titian today and send
you what information I find. What about the books? Surely you will
have to come to the V and A for them or does the Hastings reference library
have unsuspected reserves? The symbolism of Adonis and Ceres sounds
fascinating.

It is shocking that Michael may have G return to the gallery.
I suppose he is ambivalent about it. As you can suppose - so am I.
Michael is trying to make our love impossible. As you in the past
have warned me against people so I must against Michael. Do
please be on guard - despite the pressing necessity to soothe, pleasure,
reassure him, do not slacken your resistance to his attack on
you and I.

Dearest Sylvia,

I have been looking through all your paintings which I possess. The earliest is the sheet of Sylvia Sleigh note-paper with two sketches of me on it. They are not as confident as your work is now but I am very attached to them. As you know I adore the Trees at Pett but I think the picture of Marion, which you gave me at the same time, is good, too. Taken with the flowers and the owls (who are really fluffy white flowers themselves) in your letters and your superb new rose picture I have examples of your landscape, portraiture, and still-life. Not still-life, really, since such vitality and tenderness make them full of life. There is a verse of Mallarme's which sums up something of the quality of your roses and their meaning for they are symbolic as well as an enchanting painting.

Ces roses, muettes pour dire
Notre absence, elles du moin
A lui pareilles sont témoins
De votre conjugal sourire.

And your view of Fairlight. It is exactly the view that one would get from the window of the Rectory that you painted with remarkable vitality. I often think of your nude self-portrait, against the light, for it expresses so much of you and though I believe you criticise it a bit technically now it is a splendid interpretation of yourself. Can I see it again at the weekend please?

When we are together I will buy you huge canvasses and run up and down the ladder for you with cans of paint and new big brushes.

Hogarth's marriage to Jane Thornhill made a painter of him and his sexual tenderness is expressed in the conversation pieces. I am writing this chapter now so I cannot help thinking of a parallel. We can do so much mutually. I love you so.

Even as you write about Michael you express doubts of the value of his words. His reasoning - ""Lawrence is young, you are my life"" - still contains, do you see it? The reference to Time with which he hunted you before. Imagine life if you stay with Michael: apart from the threat of time you would again be dependent on his queer spasmodic love, entangled with possessiveness, the expressions of which, as you told me, are ungentle. What would happen to your painting which is another way of saying what would happen to you? It would be life without me. If you stay

Dearest Sylvia,
I hope you are well today - I send you every
fond wish and sweet greeting.  Yesterday's
letter was, I fear, perhaps a little disconnect-
ed, it was written in the Tate, but I'm sure
I managed to say the most important thing - 
namely that I love you.
Today I am going to write about Marriage a

chapter in the interests of unity.  I shall be
thinking of you all the time.  You are the art
historian's Muse as well as the Poet's.
Paul sends his love to you.  I told him that
you hoped that, one day, he would sit for you
and he was delighted and charmed.  I have ensured that he will be a good patient sitter by telling
him of the bad ones ...  But, as I said, he has
sat, often, in Liverpool.  I told him you were
looking forward to our Deptford visit - and he is
himself.  He flattered you to me last night in
terms extravagant without being unobjective.

Hammond was deliciously impudent - though, her

urgently opens a tiny parasol to enable her to pass safely.

I have two tickets for the Courbet lecture but I have not obtained one for Blunt's Claude as it is full up, unfortunately. Disappointed though I am it at least spares my having to come up to town on Friday.

The lectures are over and it is 4:30. I went to the Redfern to meet Gainsborough and discovered it was an opening day and that Madeleine Pearson was there so I was immediately introduced to numerous people.

But I managed to get them interested by giving them sadistic pictures. The landscape with a serpent was a rare success.

Tiny, I think, should know an important modification of current usage. To be really fashionable now one should use 'full' for every emphatic disparagement. For example, describing someone whom one formerly called a square: he should now be a full square, or, better still, the full drear (drear is ousting square nowadays). Be sure to tell Tiny this new development. [EG - the full bottom, the full end, & c]

We went through many drawings by the insane and - indistinguishable - a few of the nurses who watch over the class. Neither Pearce's grave doubts nor my ironical ones could dispell the idea, shared by C.J., Mary Openheim, & Celia Bedford, that schizophrenia was contagious. Measles is more of a risk - except to the three neurotics just named. He has a handsome wife whom you would have liked, I think.

Dear Sirs, 

Attention of Mr. Marsh

I have to advise that Mr.Greenwood the owner of this flat entered here recently by using his own key during my absence and without my invitation. His explanation to my wife who was sleeping was that he had failed to obtain an answer to a letter of his or to telephone calls he said he had made. In view of this you will appreciate that I can no longer be responsible for the safety of the contents of his flat since he or his friends may enter here at any time in the absence of my wife and myself. I shall of course do all I can to look after Mr. Greenwood's property.

I have also failed to obtain any receipt for the rent I have paid although I asked for these some time ago.

When asked for the receipts, Mrs. Greenwood replied that her husband would like to see me to ""discuss"" them.

In view of this somewhat peculiar way of my landlord conducting business I have asked him to negotiate with me through yourselves in future.

I shall be glad if you will kindly endeavour to obtain receipts for the three sums of £25.10.0. I have paid to Mrs. Greenwood.

Yours faithfully,

Dearest Sylvia, thank you so much for your wonderfully long letter.  Hetty, Lionel, Yawolla, and Dandy read a page each and then exchanged:  there was a little confusion but luckily Lionel was equal to the occasion and saw to it that the exchange was orderly.  Without him we would never have been sure that each of us had read all the news.  You ask about Banstead.  Well ( I have already told you how you were missed), I found, after a long search, most of the slides I wanted: Cellini's salt cellar, Sutton Place, Family of More, Flemish (Vertumnus and Pomona) and French (Danae) tapestries, early wallpaper, leather hangings, furniture, plasterwork, &c.  I have established the intricate and complex side of N European art in 16th Century: next week I shall deal with Spain and Florence and liberal republic of Venice.  Dandy is sitting with nothing on in the sun to write this.  It is, however, cloudy in the distance: also, wasps keep chasing me into corners.  Herbert Reiser suggested I write an article about Turnbull's sculpture to accompany his photographs and he will try and place it in a Swiss journal.  Turnbull invited me to his studio so I may write something.  We'll see.  This evening I am going to the South Bank with Mary: I am meeting her at 5 and then I am going on, later, to Wimbledon for the night.  then Saturday afternoon I shall see McHale and, perhaps, see a film.  (I have not been for nearly 3 weeks: it seems ... shorter.)  My war films article that I read at Pett is growing longer: soldiers as 'things', the theme of the Quest.  How interesting about the Cleggs, by the way.  I shall put in a footnote (see below)*.  I have a vivid picture of you at work on the Village Green.  It sounds charming, busy and gratifying at the same time.  You seem to be Tiny's proxy at the moment.  I hope you are looking after your hands after all this gardening.  Are you now?

I am sorry to hear that you have not been able to save quite as you hoped to.  This effects, in a way, when you can come to Blackheath.  I shall have a cheque for 16 from the Tate Gallery during next week, but until then things are rather lean.  So rather than ask you to use some of your own money, you might prefer to come to me a few days later than Monday 5th.  On the other hand I do not like the idea of your being at Pett alone for too long so if you do come and use your money I will pay you back when the cheque comes.
Which would you prefer?  As some of your money is involved in one course of action I must leave the decision to you.  If you come on Monday I am not certain that I can meet you for I have to go to Netherne, so, perhaps, if you decide to come early in the week, you would make it Tuesday when I could meet you at any time.
I hope you may be in town so we can both join the Woods at Roses.  If not, however, I will meet them there as you suggest.  It was on the 8th wasn't it: and at what time?
I have been writing our operetta again:  I have revised and improved the conversation of Pomona and Tartaglia and given them each a song.  I enclose the City Poem: perhaps you would return it when you come to town for at the moment it is the only copy.  If you like it enough I will always type it again for you.
You ask after Iris.  I saw her last night.  I am going to send to her editor a synopsis about Westerns.  Iris is keen on the idea and she now has to convince the editor it is a good idea.

My dearest Sylvia,
Forgive me for being so unpleasant and thoughtless during my stay with you. It was inexcusable - yet forgive me.
I do love you - and so very dearly. I know I hurt you and
I regret it bitterly: remember, however, please, my cold
which affected me without my realising what it was. I
still feel rather tired and jumpy and I am sure it was this
sensation which made me behave as I did. You know how irrational one is when unwell, particularly if you have not
realised that your mood is only a symptom, as much as a running nose. Poor love, you are far from well yourself.
I hope that you will rest and sleep and not worry, despite
your lover's conduct.
The Kinsington Art Gallery has sent me cards to the next
exhibitions and they are nicely designed. The next cards
I have will be yours, my love, and I long for this. Do
not feel apprehensive, my love, for I am sure you will be
a great success. I have extended my list of people to write to, I started it in the train on Friday, as I said I 
would.
Friday night when I reached the ICA I found del Renzio
had been trying to contact me. Duthuit and the three painters had not turned up and so he was desperately improvising
a discussion. He acted as chairman, Peter Banham, somebody
called Michael Compton, and I took the platform. This was
very sudden and I was reluctant to do so as I felt rotten
and had not seen the pictures. However, I could not say
'no' as I was there. Toni and Banham were favourable so
I decided not to be. After I spoke I got a weak round of
applause: it was weak, but it was the only applause there
was, so maybe it was worth something. Actually, the paint-
ings are not as interesting as I hoped.
You may remember that there is to be an exhibition
called The Beauty and Terror of the Human Head at the ICA
in March. I have been asked to lecture on it: a title
like The Head in 20c art has been suggested. Banham is
going to do one and, when I come back from Yorkshire, I
shall do mine. It is a nice subject and I am glad to ap-
pear at the ICA.
Speaking of lectures: the Travel Agency who wrote to
me (you remember the weird phrasing and a new para. for
every sentence) may mean a fair amount of work during the
season. It does not look as if I shall get more than
a £1 a lecture but still - it would all be additional to
my present earnings.",0.5,FALSE

   At last I have a chance to write to you - sitting in the train at South-ampton on my way back to town. I hope that your journey back to Pett on Wednesday was comfortable and, above all, that Tiny and Clifford made you feel welcome when you arrived. They are such an unstable pair - really weird in some ways - but they do love you very much in their eccentric wilful manner. I certainly hope that they are not upsetting at the moment. I am afraid several things have happened at once - your exhibition getting close, your exhaustion after painting so much, the Woods' woods, mine, the feeling you should leave Pett, seeing your family again, M suggesting a house at Cambridge - it is really a formidable collection of disturbing problems.
   I told Palmer, curator of Southampton, about your exhibition and he said - 'do send me a card'. He has the Gertler still-life from the Oil Salon there 'on spec'. at the moment - you remember it, huge, a little soggy.  My lecture went very nicely, I think: 100 or so people, quite a lively discussion. This morning I saw some of the gallery's permanent col. - a Wright of Derby, Pasmore, Lurcat tapestry, Tur-nor &c. It is a nice group of high standard. Some pictures are on loan there from Angus Wilson and somebody with a name like 'Odo Cross': they are parted from their pictures because they are in Jamaca, at present, so I fear Wilson will not be able to come to your show, probably.
   I have no real idea of what Southampton is like for I arrived at night, spent the morning in the art gallery, and left at 12/30. There is a vague sense of primly cleared bomb sites, new building of a suburban modernistic character, a king-size civic centre of the 30s, and, at night, sirens and hooters.

It is still secret, but Pasmore may have a teaching job at Newcastle. That will leave me freer with the ICA show I should think. He didn't tell me. I heard it roundabout - so it may not be fixed yet.

The weather here is very pleasant and mild. I hope it is so with you. If so it should be enchanting at Pett at this time of year. I feel sure you won't miss it too badly, my love, and you will still be able to visit it.

To stand upon his head, to get a laugh?

I call him up; draws breath, but what to say?
Where does Pomona enter - on the right?
And should Vortumnus be against the light?
How do they look or feel or act, the Cast?

Before the household has retired to bed?'

Whenever I nod someone picks a rose,
Or sings a song about the trials of Psyche
In a most impracticable high key.

My Dearest Sylvia,
I wish that you could have been with me this afternoon
to Beckett's. He has a very nice collection: portraits
by Kneller, Highmore, Riley, and Lely (two fine
ones): landscapes by Wilson (about eight), Turner and 
Constable and Morland, &c.  I imagined the ones you
would have liked and this increased my pleasure. One
day in the future we might be able to visit him together
if you like. He has lent me lots of photographs
of Hogarths and given me addresses to write to: I must
get in touch next with Antal. Klingender said he is
stern but Beckett says he's nice. All this is not irrelevant
in what is designedly a love letter because
the application I bring to this work has, as you know, 
an inspiration sweeter than scholarship.

Our talk this morning has made me less agitated and 
if I worried you before it was only because I was over-anxious.
The possibility of sharing your life was suddenly
brought close and at the same moment communication
became terribly difficult when it should have been easy.
These two things combined to upset me. (The coolest
Dandylion could hardly remain unaffected.) But remember, 
dearest love, that to live simply by not upsetting 
Michael, keeping things going on his own irrational
terms, is an impossible and humiliating situation to 
maintain for long though for your dear sake I am accepting
it now.

I hope you have a nice time at the Bergmanns. The 
glimpse you gave me of them on the beach at Pett with
you made them sound very pleasant. I expect a visit
will do you both good after working in the flat so long.
Alas, that I could not have come along in a practical role:

I am glad that my poems are still 'sirenish' after all, tho' fatal still fetching. Somebody ought to scale Brunskill: I love your characterisation of him, his super-ego latching on to the corners of pictures. Wonderful. The character of Brunskill which you make so vivid reminds me that I wish I had your way of catching people, because I have an idea for a story. 2 girls, one engaged to an absent man, the other [unclear]neurotically[/unclear] inhibited, both reject lovers: the 2 girls grow together, tho' starting from different points. The men are identically frustrated & become interchangeable. (The main point is the change from 'saving herself for one man' to neurotic purity in the heroine.) 
I saw Paul H last night. The first time for ages. He has an office job (until Hume's film goes into production). He took me to High Spirits. the venue with Diana Churchill & Cyril Ritchard. It was very amusing but too many good ideas did not quite click - e.g. A popular song of Henry James and a song of Lord Leighton's & [unclear]Alina[/unclear] Tadena's favorite model ('I'm sick to death of the glory that was Greece' and ""Thanks - I'll sit this orgy out'.) There was a divine '[unclear]potted[/unclear]' musical comedy of 1918 - The Shopgirl Princess which was bliss. Very good, also, was a number called 'A Laugh,, A Song, & a Lexicon' in which a Vaudeville pair (like the Fit-as-a-Fiddle number in Singin' In The Rain) named BOSWELL & JOHNSON do their act. One song was: 'Maybe it's because I'm a Lexiconer, that I love language so.' (Don't tell, Clifford...)
I met Eduardo Paolozzi yesterday and on quite well with him. It's amazing what a little article will do - as a 30ish song nearly said.

Dearest Sylvia,

It is 3.45 and I have just paused from writing
about Hogarth.  Yesterday I wrote - and types -
1,250 words and today, so far - I am continuing
after I post this letter, I have written a thousand.
I have developed a wonderful and I hope original
theory about H's use of colour.

The Fallacy of Height has also been added to in
the last day or two and you will not be sorry to 
hear that M. Douglas Cooper has been added to Heron,
Malraux, Fischel, &c.  John McHale exchanged some
books with me and when I opened one of his I found
the Cooper quotation. A rare, Apollonian felicity,
do you not think?

A great advantage I have over you is that when
you are away you have only Michael whereas I have
your pictures.  How splendid they are:  Minerva,
in particular, has held my attention these last
two days - her great clean leap from Zeus' head
symbolising the clarity and strength I hope to attain in my criticism.

As you will realise from my opening words I
have my watch back.  How is yours?

I have Mon and their Motives (from the library)
and so been able to read the Henry VIII: isn't it
good.  I have also re-read Glover's Freud and J.
articles in Horizon (He is very stern about amateur
psychoanalysts!)  I have got a vast and exciting

WIMBLEDON.

Sunday

my dearest Sylvia,
what a lucky week: the only day we did not meet was Thursday.  This week is not going to be so generous to us - still there is Wednesday and Friday.

I trust that you were not forced to wall to Pett because of the afternoon the snow was even deep in London.

Johnson sent first his 'best regards' to you, then decided he would return your 'love', but finally compromised by giving his love to you - and to Michael.  You know Johnson is always learning things at the gallery, to be picked up later?  Well, the other day, he told me, innocently amused, that he left an umbrella and two bottles of ink.  

Don't forget to let me know what books you want for your C19th [unclear]French[/unclear] lecture.  How is the rococo one shaping?  I expect it will even transform mock-",0.4,FALSE

My dearest Sylvia
The weather like everything else conspires to make
me wish myself at Pett: the sun prickles my face.
Pearls come. As your bus curved out of the station
I glimpsed again the Hastings Poster. Last night I
glanced through some poems by Max Jacob - and met your name, Sylvie.
At present I have only the Marion watercolor be-
cause on my way home on Friday I stopped at Eric's
flat and gave him the other one to frame for me. I 
shall have it back early next week when it will go straight
up on my wall - the only picture there. I shall have
to go and visit him before then however because I am im-
patient to study it. On Friday I looked long and hard
at 'Marion' and liked again the color and the sense of 
mass, of weight. And I like the slight twisting plane
of the lips in contrast to the straighter lines of nose
and eye-sockets. Oh you are so manifestly a painter 
in your strengths and richness.
Thinking about our talk on Friday and looking at your
watercolor now I think I was right when I said you give
an impression of weight, and consequently of growth and
movement, and not a map of planes which, as sometimes in
M's less successful pieces, are really rather flimsy - 
despite their precision. 
But you react against
the 20th century, post-Cézanne earnestness; mercifully,
to this old reactionary. Take 'Marion'. Though she 
sits back in the chair she is not still, not static.
Nor is it just the great swinging mass of hair that keeps 
her tense: the whole form is felt as capable of movement, 
of 'displacing' space to use a marine term which fits here.
Vincent Lines, if he followed his own silly antithesis, 
would have to put you with Blake!
I hope to hear news of a new work in your next letter.
Christchurch, Spitalfields, oh dear, is by Hawksmoor.
Really his baroque has Victorian affiliations - in this
case. I think it would sound alright on paper - but 
that's all.
Mother's Red Cross Party ran from about 6-30 to nearly 3. Violent games and test of general knowledge and God
remembers what else. I provided a scatological treasure
hunt which, instead of disgusting, was a success. Lots
of nice things to eat and drink and - what is more - lots left. This mitigates the ordeal.",0.4,FALSE

There. I am still tinkering with the sonnets so no
more in this letter

I hope you are not doing any work again yet, anything really serious I mean, but I hope that soon you
will feel alright to adapt those clothes you mentioned
and use those feathers. When you have done this and
I see you wearing them I think I shall have to write
some Mallarmésque compliments--delighted and intricate.
And what about the material you have with Clifford's
blessing? How pleasant to go to church in it. Though
I fear the very stones will groan at the pagan sophistication of the material's new appearance. Do tell me when you start and what you do. You will look ravishing in the new look, Sylvia.

It is exactly eleven o'clock. I love you.

I have not yet found any book of Titian although I
have looked in several libraries. But really I shall
leave no shelf unturned.

Johnson went to the Albertina drawings yesterday
with the Poisers (spelling?) but--see above--I prefer-
red Chelsea in the afternoon. However I am having tea
with him tomorrow and he tells me it wasn't sunstroke but
a kind of influenza and the doctor doesn't really know
what it was. (Could it have been psychological?)

Oh, this is delightful. Another clock has just struck
eleven. Still I am thinking of you. I love you.

I ache this morning because I played various running 
about games with Myranda, Marion, and Lynda yesterday,
three cousins whose combined age is about twenty-three.
Please don't be patronising about it.

Today I think I shall eat all my sweet ration
because I think there is going to be a war soon.

morning what I have started to learn from Ransom on Shake-
speare's language in [unclear]Genovee[/unclear] Review.  Altogether crude is the
experiment of mine I admit but the intention is there:  I have
juxtaposed (18th jargon, 'Phoebus,' '[unclear]grot[/unclear],' and the (18th concep-
tion of owl with the fast, rather harsh rhythm of the (20th 
ballad though here I've been rather eclectic, I'm afraid.
Still it's my muse's fault if I rush some of our poems be-
cause she urged me not to neglect my prose about Hogarth.

   Michael's 'reorganising' of the table reminds me
of an alleged act of Rimbaud's who, when his mother refused
to hire a piano to give him music lessons.  Earned the top
of Mrs. Rimbaud's table to piano shape.  In case
you are 
thinking of coming to London one day here is some advice which
[unclear]Verlaine[/unclear] gave to a friend after his first visit here.  'One never
says 'if you please' but merely 'please.'  Well, that's sound, but 
he goes on ""The word 'Stop' is only used on boats, & to [unclear]cabmen[/unclear] you
say 'much obliged.'  The word 'beefsteak' does not exist & it is
an appalling indecency to say ""water closet"" instead of 'W.C.'
Once when Vrlaine wanted a wash he said, in English: 'Ex-
cuse me, I have got plenty of dust!'  When he visited the N.G.
he disliked Turner and Hogarth.  I must look up the reasons
for this latter taste.

   Thank you for sending me [unclear]Sewanee.[/unclear]  And I will
elaborate the proverb in my next letter but the book is
not by me just at present (it's upstairs.)

   I was tempted to date this letter the 9th but if i had
done so I should probably have appeared a day early at Pett
but it is wonderful to think there are only ten days before
we meet.  I adore you, Sylvia, and just now as I thought of 
diminishing wedge of days between us, I got a tiny un-
mistakable sensation in my tummy, excitement, apprehension, 
desire.  I love you.

From my bedroom I can see, on a
level with my first floor window, a
splash of strong red.  They are - roses.
They have climbed up a holly tree and

right above even their boldest sisters on

Cooking very likely.  How are preparations for the journey going?  There is
no need to take any books.  If you want
any to read in Italy you can get what
you want in Paris - French, American, 
or even English publications.  A good
English-American book shop is in the Rue
Soufflot, on a corner, on the right
when you walk up toward the Pantheon.
I cannot find the notes I made in Paris
about restaurants - but since you will
not be using student-facilities in the
short time you are there (it would not
be economical as in any case Michael
would not tolerate such eating conditions,
I imagine) it doesn't much matter.  You can find scores of restaurants.  There is
a cheap typical one in the Rue Racine

is a very formidable one. It makes you wretched,
sometimes, I know, and as I discovered at Pett last
time I am helpless once it takes over. But the point
is that these expressions of early allegiance are not
the central features of your personality as you have
proved often. You prove it, for example, by loving
me, despite pains and obstacles. So dearest Sylvia
never forget that I love you, fiercely, naively, tenderly. I judge your love to make you happy (despite
trials) because that is what my love for you does for
me. Please, darling, measure my love by yours. I
believe passionately in yours and need no proof of mine
since outside it nothing has any meaning for me.

I was pleased to read that your hands are smooth,
your nails long. That your hair is fairer and your
lines smoother: but I do remember that when I last
saw you, you were a ravishing creature and that you,
following Michael's lead, have exaggerated fantastically, the evidence of Angst. Mirrors are not entirely
objective after all: there is always the beholder as
an unstable element, wilful in doubt. Changes or no

Dearest Sylvia,
I had to stop my last letter before I intended to because I discovered Saturday morning when I should have finished it that the V and A library is closing for a week, and that work I intended to do on Monday had to be done on Saturday.  So I experienced yet more memories of you yesterday when I had lunch in that milk bar at South Kensington where we have been, it's called 'Nic's', I'm afraid.  I was sorry not to be able to get a seat where we had been.  The weather is no better than in my last letter.  The Summer seems to be ending with a bang.  Not with a whimper.  Perhaps it will revive.  You will return to a brownish Inghilterra.  You know what Dürer said about Germany in Venice?  'Oh how cold it will be after the sunshine'.

I have been typing out my notes for my first lecture on Tuesday.  I have found a mistake in Johnson's Flemish & Dutch syllabus:  he says Vermeer influenced Motsu whereas in fact M foreshadowed V.  De Groot points this out in his great work.  Has not Johnson read this?  It was printed 40 years ago.

I don't think that the Paris cafe prices are too high but rather that students are not in Paris now and that makes a big difference.

Your dress, the Minerva one, does sound charming.  How I look forward to seeing it.  By the way, my trousers are not yet dyed.  I wasted a lot of time trying to find a cleaner with pastel shades at his disposal and now the best of them is full up and not dying men's things.  (I think they'll have to be nigger.)  Other colors are for export - Fawn and so on.

Your account of Pallas and Apollo, side by side was delightful.  And your sight of space composition in the life must have been thrilling.  The huge pink shell sounds both Umbrian and like the shell from which Venus stepped.

When we meet next I shall be very excited to hear if this feast of painting has given you any especial ideas for new paintings.  Of course you were in Italy before but this trip is altogether more professional.  Will Sienese mannerism be apparent in you draughtsmanship I wonder?  There is so much to talk about.

that there are some nice home-made cakes for the tea.

letters as you appear to have done at Siena.
My timing was at fault I imagine.  I am sorry
you will not have had any letters at Perugia.
But this and another should be at Bologna for 
you on the 11th.  I trust so.

Tomorrow I must go to the Wallace and look
at the Metsus. You can imagine the memories I shall encounter there. Indeed I have
encountered them already; simply by writing
this the past has taken form and urgency. I remember looking out of the window, over a Giovanni da Bologna cast, and seeing you round a corner.

While I am on the subject of films
(and you now how the subject tempts
me) I want to refer back to les jeux
sont fait which I think we have not interpreted quite correctly. It seems our
Sartre was not saying that only their
outside preoccupations separated
the lovers but that (this is part of his
philosophy and not actually present
in the film) they were bound to be separated, as the heavenly authorities
knew, and as the last image so certainly displays. In love, Sartre says,
one wishes to enter another's being and
this he says is impossible, since man
has no resource outside himself. And
since man has to be ""committed"", as the
man in his film was on the side of the 
proletariat, love has no real chance.
I don't know if that is clear. If not we
shall talk about it when we meet.
Or in another letter but existentialism
is so long winded, I'm afraid. still I am 
determined to know all about it now
though I'm afraid pleasure and surrealisme and psychoanalysis and aesthetics
mean more to me than Sartre's liberty.
And I need not tell you of my reaction to Sartre's frustrated view of love.

Dearest Sylvia
I was overwhelmed by my [unclear]owl[/unclear] reception.  Garlands of roses
as you promised and also an [unclear]owl [/unclear]orchestra playing a Benjamin Britten anthem.  This morning I went to see Beckford's Tower (up
beyond Lansdowne) and my white and Tawny companions were en-
chanted at it.  I could hardly drag them away - they kept swooping round it and disappearing inside.  We were four - Deirdre 
13 years old as I told you - was with me and we were lucky enough to find some mushrooms.  Here again I was grateful [unclear]to [/unclear] the 
supernatural powers you have granted your owls for they flew
ahead spotting for us although it was broad day.
From where I write I can see [unclear]sham[/unclear] Castle on the hill.  The Tawny
Owl has snatched the opportunity - we've just had Sunday dins -
[unclear]to[/unclear] have a lie down on the bed and the white One is reading a Bath guide with great interest because he had not realised - he is
very young - that Minerva had so much to do with Bath from the
earliest days.  The Tawny one intends to take the waters while he is 
here - he had a twinge in the left wing last evening and a Beau Owl,
who met us at the station, told him he could soon be cured at the 
Baths.
Picking mushrooms reminded me very fiercely of a week ago
at Pett.  I cannot believe it is so little time since we met. [On the

Dearest Sylvia,

   I am happy to have your letter, and it contains, at last
a drawing.  I take such pleasure in your sketches, even
the slightest and this is no exception.  It is rough and
luminous.  Thank you for it.  And how I long to see again
the picture it vividly recreates though it has never left
my mind's eye.  Your cool additions to it conjure up deli-
cious images.  I shall hunt out a damson tree and examine
it, if not with a Ruskinian precision, at least with a Hogarthian pleasure in its 'variety'.  What makes me happy
too is your own satisfaction with it.  Dandylion puts a 
firm approving paw on your shoulder.

    Alas, that Michael does not learn.  You charged me on
the phone with not caring but in fact I do considerably.
Our last unhappy talk has had the effect of battering me
into a kind of restraint.  Possibly not permanent but
working at the moment.  You must not think; 'Oh, he is
stopping loving me'.  I have not given up my hopes and I
would not give  you up even in order to help you.  I love
you and hope for some meetings.  But I shall try, as I
have tried a bit in my letters, not to strain you emotionally.  I doubt if compromise will be possible indefinitely
but it is time you had a rest.  Tell me, however, that it
will not simply work in Michael's favour, because it is not easy for me.

     I love you.

     I shall tell Lines to expect me on the 12th.

     We are unlucky with phones and this morning was no exception.
Still it did get clearer toward the end and it is always enough
to hear your voice to make my whiskers tremble with excitement.
How I love you.  You referred to a crisis?  Do you mean there
has been another one?  Poor,  Sylvia, I hope that the Woods are
being especially nice - I'm sure they are.     

     Le Diable Au Corps:  briefly, I did not approve of the intro-
duction of death at the end where, previously action had depended
on character and perhaps the boy's early passages were too confi-
dent but we see the reason for this later after all.  I admired
it very much otherwise:  do ask Clifford what made him so contemptuous of it.  (It is nice as a  film though as I'm sure he'll
agree.)

     I must go and find some lunch.  I hope for a steak.  I shall
write again after tea in time to catch the last post.  I love you, I love you.

Dearest Sylvia,

I love you: how much yesterday's meeting meant to me.
We were together for about eight hours. Not long perhaps,
but love made so much of it. I am swept off my feet with
delight when we meet and time means very little. You are
beautiful, much too beautiful to waste time in anxiety.
Be assured about the future as you are of my love: once
you doubted that at times but you do not now. Soon I
will banish this doubt as I did the other - simply by loving you. You have done so much for me: banished wrecks
from the map leaving only winds and mermaids. I will
only your pleasure: that is my motive for writing. My
rose, my Minerva, my cat.

I looked at your painting in the train for a long time
and was very happy and I have been looking at it in this
morning's rather murky daylight. The tints of the leaves
are exquisite and I adore the way in which they grow in different directions, some inwards, some outwards, never flatly.
It is a darling composition - a kind of pictorial equivalent
to Mallarme's poems about roses. It is at once precise and
trembling with life. I adore it and adore you for letting
me have it. I return to your pictures so often, dearest
Sylvia.

Last night I caught the 7.5 train at 7.30 and we got into
Victoria at about 10.15 so that was not at all bad really.
I did not reach home till about 11.30, however, as the fog
was worse in town than elsewhere. I had a hot drink and
went to bed then. I hope you did not get cold at Battle
and that you changed your socks as soon as you get to Pett.
Today it is worse than ever. I hope my schools come to-
morrow to the N.G. Pablo has just come in and he is purring thunderously with pleasure at the heat of the fire.

I enjoyed Battle very much, it was an odd and lyrical
experience. This poem does not do justice to it but it was
written in the train and I send it to you anyhow:

Here brown benedictines constructed an abbey
And herbs grow on the ledge of a lancet window.

The towers at the end of the terrace are unencumbered
By facts of structure, roots, the enemy of flight.

If it is convenient to bring things which we will not actually need in Stafford but afterwards bring them and Molly will, I know, store them till our return.

As you may have heard from Clifford and Marjorie

the night at Wimbledon.  The weather was unpleasant and, in any case, I wanted the trays.   Unfortunately my mother is still only willing to part with one
of them - and I have reluctantly accepted this

'Connoisseurship and Appreciation' - I hope it will not

memories she roused (like sluggish bubbles in a sump whose appear-

[unclear]Picketts[/unclear], Shannon.  'Yes', I agreed, 'an artist is often unappreciated

Back at the Aubreys 'human nature' is to be seen, also.  I
believe I mentioned a three-footed dwarf & her husband as fellow
guests.  The other day in the sunshine they came to sit in the garden
& I was not far off. She is a compulsive bitch, given to ordering her
contemptible wisp of a husband about.  He got her a chair.  She sat in
it & then querulously asked for another.  Her husband put down his
paper, got up, & got another chair for her. She sat there for a minute.  Then she
sent John upstairs for a rug.  Muffled in this she began to knit &, of
course, dropped the ball of wool which ran away despite her harsh
discordant exclamations of anger.  Then she told John she would
be more comfortable in the shelter of the house; would he help her to
move nearer.  She was placed up against the wall.  She settled
down, pulled the rug to the right shape, adjusted her glasses, got 
ready to knit when - 'John', she cried 'John, is it raining?'
He looked at the impeccable sky. 'John, John, I'm wet' she
cried, struggling in the chair

Well, I am home, to find your letter. I
love the way the initial of Sylvia curls
round my pronoun. What I have done is
look at the portraits again and seen, for the
first time, the landscape which I think is
very good. It is a splendid and exciting
sky and I think the drawing of the
narrow landscape beautifully compact &
well-explained. I long for morning so I
can see the colours properly. Apart from the
thrill of seeing a new work by you (and,
darling, this never lessens) I was pleased 
(and not in the least surprised) to find our
portraits every bit as good as memory told me
they were.

Dearest Sylvia,

First let me give you the first Hetty poem, one of many you may be sure.

In the equivocal afternoon
We view the term in profile;
On our terms, not on his,
Discuss how the sexes feel
In their bodily exchanges.

Sleeping did we touch two snakes
Twined in green and serpent love
That now we are disordered
And I am feminine above
What is masculine below?

The two-way looking term commands
A double-world of moon and sun:
As singleness of aim is lost
We own both properties in one,
Pleasures doubled at half the cost.

(The snakes are those Tiresias struck and which turned his sex from male to female.)

I have also written two pastorals, both of them the result of the train of thought and feeling set in motion by your new Hetty picture. First is a rococo one, same period as Hetty, of course:

Pedants, country-girls, and huntsmen
Move lazily in the evening's grey frieze

will have to be hung - when it arrives - in the reading room,
among the old men reading the Illustrated London News and

matter provided that they do not hawk continually.

Like falling trees we swim towards
The coral springboard of the bed,
Indifferent to gravity.
Now mirrors are less confident
Of the rooms in which they hang:
Who pauses by the glass appears
With a ghost's penumbra.
The balconies that cage the rooms
Curl like seaweed pulled by tides.

Each room is like a bottle
Where the full-legged vessels grow
In the glass hull of a dream:
Ships that never reach the coast
Past the [unclear]barrier[/unclear] of dawn.

Dearest Sylvia,
I enclose a carbon copy of your article.  As I typed it
I made one or two small adjustments:  I felt I could do this
for as one types and the article looks more as it does when
in print little things occur to one.  I hope you agree.  As
I typed my admiration for its structure and your individual
phrases, with something of Osbert's richness and irony, grew.
I do think it a very good article indeed.

You know the letter you sent me for Gainsborough is unsigned.
So what I think I shall do is send the article with a photograph of Bronzino's Allegory, recommending your article to
G's attention at the same time, and quoting your suggested
illustration.  He is expecting the photograph and I can include on Painting Out of Doors with it.  Let me know first 
post on Monday if this is acceptable: I will wait until then before dispatching it (the week end intervenes anyhow so we
shall not be wasting time).  And, again, congratulations on
your article - I did enjoy it.

I enclose, at last, the lyrics for you, my darling.  At
last, you can say now, some love poems from my lion at last,
directly to me.  I have written them carefully, investing
much love in them:  hence the long time in sending them.  I
hope they are worth it.  Oh dearest Sylvia, I love you so
much and miss you with fearful intensity.  We must meet soon.

has said nothing directly, is very pale and quiet.  Oh I

keeping Y off the mobile though, of course, she is light enough
and agile enough not to harm it.

The only pictures I can think of with artists at work are
impressionist garden pieces which would reproduce badly.  I 
think the Cézanne pictures you mentioned would do very well.

At last, today, I am going to go to the Kensington Gallery.
I shall go to the V and A, make out some lantern slide lists,
and then go to the Salon.  I need not tell you, darling, how

Dearest Sylvia,
My own true love, will you come on Saturday? I am certain of the
N.G. cheque by then and we can have at least a few days together - 
without which I do not know how I can survive. I adore you so much
and our prolonged separation is distressing and hateful. I will return from Birmingham early, to be back on Saturday 9th, before lunch,
and I can meet your bus in the afternoon. Do, oh do come my dearest
love, my rose. If I had not your pictures to delight me here, both
aesthetically and for their loving content, I do know how how I could
bear this void in which time goes by for an unaccustomed time with-
out bringing you here on his back, like Clio among the feathers of
his wings. Come, bringing every owl, and Hetty will comb Dandy's mane
& Dandy hold the mirror for Hetty and even Yawolla, he has assured
me, will be smartly dressed & with his hair combed back. For
Yawolla is terribly subdued with you away. 'When is she coming?' he keeps
asking Dandy & poor Dandy looks dejected as he turns out his trou-
user's pocket and answers 'soon'. I have told Yawolla, in an effort
to lighten his spirits, that you are coming on Saturday, and he has
turned a rather hesitant cartwheel as he starts to recover. So come
my love, come.
I enclose two poems for you - ones which please me particularly and I hope will please you, too.
Ithell Colquhoun, whom I met last night, seems very nice. I will
talk over with you her suggestions about a magazine. She is a strange
person, very naive in many ways. She thinks it ought to be an ambitious magazine with backing such as Rodney Philips gone Polemic. I
think that would be nice but is that practical? I doubt it.
Tomorrow I must take slides back to Courtauld and the V & A and
collect your pictures from Mrs. Marchant. I look forward to having them
up again.
It is only 10.30 but I feel rather tired so I shall go to bed. I do
look forward to news about your Melpomene illustration. Do you
like the title 'The Navigable Profile' for a poem? I may write a little

Morris did not found the Arts and Crafts movement, though it is sometimes taken for granted that he did and he contributed help to its efforts. Was it not what he had intended? It was -and yet it was not. That others should, as he did, take a pride in the individual work of the hand, that was what he could have wished.

Can epiphanies be blue,
Can they have five points,
To turn in the night's wards,
Do they have two heads, one eye?

Does it happen in Italy,
Is there music or a calm,
Do you know it when
Wings kidnap sleeping girls?

But I'm the epiphany
Silently-spoke the rose: it's me
The glass communicated,
Where your love has been.

The electric bulb
Rushed outwards till it was
A tree whose branches filled
The room, the world.

guilty at my stupidity I hoped it was not large
in your mind.  As often I err on the side of
easiness - as you say.  I cannot defend my-
self, only reproach myself.
   Your pessimism about human-beings ex-
presses what I have assumed to be the case gen-
erally speaking but with you it is urgent &
unhappy in a way that makes my gloom nomin-
al and trivial.  When we do not meet reg-

not want to be dependent on you in the way

at Blackheath. He accepted, arrived at 11.00 o'clock, and is here
with me now as I write. He is delighted to hear that he may yet be
able to exhibit with you if circumstance get better for him. Paul
sends his love to you. (As I write a dove is cooing away outside -

looking forward to Clifford's lecture very much. You will be able to
hear it I am sure. Be careful with your gardening: do not overdo
it and 'regard apres votre mains', says Hetty. (That's what she says.)

I have an Arts Council lecture at Westcliffe next Wednesday: Cubism,

Dearest Sylvia,

I hope your journey back to Pett was not too bad: at least
when you left Victoria you did not have anybody next to you and
you had a seat that you like on the bus. Thank you so much for
staying until that last bus for it did make my happy to have you with me for as much of Friday as possible. To symbolize my
sadness at being separated from you in early Spring snow has fallen in an incredible quantity. Saturday was wretched, the landscape as cold and sterile as I felt without you. What was the
weather like at Pett? Will the snow harm your various edible
plants in the garden? Perhaps it is milder at Pett, as you suggested.

I am glad to be able to tell you that you will not be called
on to sign a guarantee for my overdraft after all. I saw Mr.
Bacon, the Manager, yesterday and he tells me the National Provincial bank are reluctant to accept the signature of married
ladies in these matters, as (in the event of a court case) judges
uphold any tearful lady who says she does not know what she is
signing. So it looks as though I shall have to speak to father
about it. Thank you so much for being willing to help me. I
do value your confidence, but I am happy you are spared the responsibility, even for a short time.

Saturday's lecture on sculpture went very nicely. As the weather was rotten, of course, I expected few people. I began with
three people, but the number grew until, finally, I had nearly
20 people: several joined on, the disappeared, and returned with
stools. I talked about Renoir, Maillol: these as humanist
sculptors. Then Dobson as an example that humanism alone is
not enough necessarily. Then Marini as a humanist plus expressionist. Finally, Arp and Giacommetti as a-humanists. I enjoyed
it and I think it went very well. (How well, by the way,
Renoir's few sculptures function in 3-dimensions: I am surprised how good
they are spatially.) By the way, snow has entered the roof of
the gallery containing Evill, Newton's pictures in the C.A.S. gallery: what a fantastic condition for a public gallery to be in!

I think of you in association with everything I do or think.
For example, Father gave me the new IJPA (I don't think Clifford
will get his for a day or two.) and I wish so much to read you
articles in it. It is a Melanie Klien number. She is having
a birthday party for psychoanalysts today. There is an article
on aesthetics, one of the 'inner world' in literature (Donne,
Conrad, &c.), and another on Ibsen's Master Builder. I feel
very stimulated by these pieces indeed. Would you were here.

Supports a plaque.

Perhaps you walked through Adelaide
On Regency Square
About this time as, on the front, laid
In a deck-chair.

Scissors cutting through a dress.

Of The Chinese house?

Dearest Sylvia,

I miss you so much. I feel depressed without you here for I love you so much. My actions, awake, in bed, lecturing, suffer from incompleteness because you are not there too. In an effort to quell my loneliness I read the second Cheri novel, hoping that the vividly living characters would console me: perhaps they did a little but I kept being reminded by the illusion of our reality. Fiction cannot really make up what one misses. Art as make-believe is no antidote to the fact of missing you.

Thank you for your letter. I am delighted, and impressed, that your two nudes so nearly fit the frames. Congratulations: what an eye you have. Obviously, do not measure your frames in future. Feline intuition cannot be surpassed for accuracy.

Oh you poor creature, bothered by Tiny. I consider she is as irresponsible with her gloom as she considers I am in the other direction. I place her in the landscape round the Rectory, the garden that is: dead gold-fish, 'two little marrows', expiring French beans. I am sorry the garden is in this slightly battered state though I feel certain that much will survive even this drought: it always does.

Yesterday's lecture was well-attended (30 people): Rodin, Despiau, Bourdelle, and Dalou. Madeleine came to the last part, enjoyed it, and gave me tea. She enquired after you and hoped that you would soon spend more time in town. My extra lecture on 20 c. masterpieces is on 11th August. Tomorrow's lecture is on Ward and his Contemporaries: nobody came to it when it was called Regency Painters; nor when I called it Romantic Painters. It'll be amusing to see if the new name makes any difference...

Monica gave me the Penguin book on Hopper (you remember Tyler's article): it contains some very interesting works in addition to those we have seen already. (That is to say, she gave it to me from the bookstore stock when I demanded it).

How are you sleeping? I am not sleeping too badly but I wake very early. I am glad you may go to Canterbury: I feel sure you will enjoy the Cathedral again, despite Mjj.

I will send you The Murderer and the Ad-Man as soon as it is revised and various other shorter poems I am working on.

I had such a bad headache all yesterday that I have played truant from church this morning and have pottered about framing and tidying up a bit. i have framed my ""Still life for Dido"" in a pale gold frame and I think that it looks very well. I have an octagonal frame which I got from the Jones' the opening being 11 inches across and admiring that charming head in a gesso frame with a mirror in (V&A) it I thought I might emulate it and making heads of Venus and Mars with some gesso work!

Thank you for your letters. I am so sorry that you have caught my cold but at least you are staying in bed so I hope you will recover quickly.
Those Woods, really. What kind of people are they? Charming, loving, generous when I am there but full of negative criticism when I am gone. It adds to your worry, I fear.

My Dearest Sylvia
Thank you for your letter. I am so pleased to hear that your visit to the Greenwoods was such a success; that is good. I hope that by now your period is diminishing and that you feel cheerful and healthy. Good that you have caught the sun.
How, I very much wonder, are the Woods? Although Tiny sometimes collects alien and nasty ways on her holidays, I expect that Clifford is sweeter after a break. Did they enjoy the visit of Grace and Gordon? I hope so; or, perhaps, disenchantment proceeded as before?
By the way, would you tell me, once more, the date of the fete? I have forgotten.
I shall not bother to go to Corsham as Armitage is 
away. Apparently it is unusual for him to be away from Bath, too. He would have to go away this week. However, perhaps it does not matter. The Magazine of Art is closing down and so Goldwater cannot, of course, publish my article. He has sent my synopsis to Art News (the American one). What a pity about the end of the Mag. of Art - and not just for my sake.                                                 Parkham sounds divine. Lucky cat.

That's too bad about Iris. However,why don't you do as she suggests and send your sketches to ''Lilliput'- saying that 'Britannia & Eve' suggested you should contact them?

Re-reading  your story I like it even more. But why is Daphne a little withered? She does not have the morbid purity of one of my characters the way you built her up:so, why, ""withered""? The way the points of view of the 2 girls changes during the course of their conversation is very skillful. Susan's self-betraying words to Basil are excellent: really, though, why don't you complete it with the 2 girls' reactions to Basil's proposal? The characters may be trivial, as you say, but that's no reason for throwing them away suddenly. That's what [unclear]Maurioc [/unclear] does.

How lucky you are to be able to swim. On the other hand how unlucky you are in your father: it really is too bad that he should persecute you by mail now. Never mind: forget it- he is not worth attention. He only seems to amount to- say- a subsidiary character in a John O'Hara short story.

You are kind enough to ask about the ICA discussion. The best thing I can do, I think, is send you the typescript of my opening remarks- which I read. (let me have it back sometime, if you would.)

I can see that Chandler is a 'sadistic homosexual'. Why is he 'strongly puritan'? Because Marlowe doesn't fuck everybody he could? I should have thought his abstinence had something to do with the final moral effect of Chandler. 

I do hope that your nightmares concerning Michael have abated now and that you are sleeping better.

Dearest Sylvia,

Did you enjoy the Wallace Collection yesterday. I hope you
thought, among so many delicious objects and pictures and images,
of our many visits there on Wednesday mornings. . . 

The Tate Gallery was stuffy and crowded and by the end of the
afternoon I felt dreadful. I should not have gone I think.
Today my cold is worse so I am glad to be staying in. I do
not think I shall come to town until Thursday evening when I
have an AIA committee meeting. Since that may go on until
about eight and since it is your last night at the flat
I will not, I think, avail myself of Michael's invitation to
a meal. Thank him, do.

The trees we can see from the window are becoming slightly
green and soon the great green curve, like the long side of
the coliseum, should cover the factories in the middle-distance. Once that happens I am really ready to welcome you
back.

How did you sleep last night? I dreamed of you much of the
time. I remember you promised - in the dream - you had good
news for me. Think of some good news for me and make the
dream true, there is a nice cat.

Vallance, the Sutton WEA secretary, who came yesterday, tells
me he knows Miss Sleigh is much appreciated by the class who
think her contributions valuable. He wants me to give a talk
there in the Summer, a single one, with original pictures by
my friends there. You first, of course; your two watercolours
started the idea so you can see they were appreciated. I wondered if I could get a couple of pictures each from Paul, Eric,
and John McHale (though, perhaps, you resist the last-named).

Think about canvases, ideas and sizes, my Minerva for I can afford to buy one or two at the moment.

Oh my dearest Sylvia, I love you. How charming was your recent letter which included a hug and two kisses, especially for
Dandy. He adored that. His tail curled up with pleasure.
So often the phone is more remote than a letter. Is the instrument too modern for us? It must be that. Nonetheless I
look forward to ringing you tomorrow at about noon. Apart from
every other reason I wish you were here to read to me - you give
me a double pleasure then, from the book, and your musical voice.

Dearest Sylvia,

Of course I shall come on the 10th, but not by bus for that would get me to Hastings too late.  I shall come by train:  which one I shall tell you in my next letter, which will follow this evening.

This is from Erwin Panofsky's Studies in Iconology, Oxford, New York, 1940. p150 et seq.
   Titan's Sacred and Profane Love executed 'not later than 1515 when the influence of Bembo's Asolani was at its height'.  The two figures resemble personifications in Cesare Ripa's Iconological Book.  (a) Felicita Eterna and (b) Felicity Breve.  The nudity of (a) denotes contempt for earthly perishable things and the flame she carries symbolises love of God; the jewels of (b) and her vessel of gold and gems symbolise a shorter-lived happiness.  Thus Titan's nude and richly attired ladies understood to represent 'an antithesis between eternal and temporal values'.  The picture is 'a document...of  Neoplatonic humanism'  because the 'figures do not express a contrast between good and evil, but symbolise one principle in two modes of existence and two grades of perfection'.  As Facino puts it:  both are 'honorable and praiseworthy in their own way'.  The Venere Celeste is universal, eternal beauty, but intelligible and lucid - non-medieval.  The Venere Volglare is tangible, perishable beauty, and also the generative force on earth.  The landscape background is divided into a dimly lit scene with town and hares (symbols of animal love and fertility) and, behind Felicita Eterna, a more rustic scene, brighter, with sheep and a church.  The scheme of composition derives from what Panofsky suggests we call the 'debating picture' which is 'a representation of two allegorical figures symbolising and advocating two divergent moral or theological principles'.  The fact that Cupid stirs the water between the living fecundity may express the neoplatonic belief that 'love acts as an intermediary between heaven and earth':  he is placed nearest to the terrestrial Venus.  'Titian depicts a wonderful harmony between intelligible and visible beauty'.  The correct title is Geminae Venares, Panofsky concludes, but Sacred and Profane Love is near enough.  

Now I must go to the B.M. and read Jonathan Richardson on Painting.  Thank you for your letter and do not feel sad, please.  I so look forward to seeing you in three days time.  I love you, Lawrence",0.2857142857,FALSE

when I talked further with him the suspicion evaporated.  If

This time my lecture was successful, I am glad to say. We had a long post-script at the end dealing with abstract paintings which was very lively and I used the epidiascope. 65 people came to it, including a dozen charming school-girls, delectable in their enormous mufflers & vast striped knitted gloves. My landlady here, despite her name ([unclear]Una[/unclear]) is terribly nice: she gave me dinner before I went and now I am eating a light supper & she has just told me I can have a bath.

I have added 40 lines to the poem and I have picked up the [unclear]eye[/unclear] image and described the factories in terms of [unclear]surgeries[/unclear] and also echoed the 'lemons of departure' by describing the industrial squalor as a nature morte. You remember that you read me a few lines of Baudelaire's [unclear]giantess [/unclear] sonnet?

How was your party on Friday? I wish I could have stayed for some of it, at least. My train incidentally arrived at Victoria on schedule tho there was a fog service in London itself. Tell me about your party.

The Jacobsen's party was pleasant with some very nice drinks, one especially with a Bourbon base was good. Architectural students and Americans mainly. Adrian Heath's party went well, too: Anthony Hill Patrick Heron were there and so was Prunella Clough, who I was interested to meet for, as you know, I quite like her work. She was very lesbian with Magda.

I spent Saturday night at Magda, waking at noon - refreshed and in good health - ready for my afternoon lecture. Today I have to get my Harpenden lecture ready. What a bore.

Yes, thank you darling, your letter came this morning by the first post.  Oh, are you not unfortunate with your lanterns!  However, from my knowledge of you, and of the lecture you prepared, and from your own words, I am sure it was a success.  I am so happy.  Once you had 'warmed up' I'm sure you found it very pleasant to be influencing people in the right direction once more.  Accept this lion's congratulations and admiration.  Do save the sequence of illustrations you had planned for Lionel and me to see.  If no one asked questions it is, of course, because you had answered all objections in your talk.

My slides have come for the Birmingham lecture.  I am hoping to borrow some more from Charles and Helen Rosenau:  at the moment I have eight by David himself . . .  I have been preparing the lecture all afternoon.  For no reason I can think of they out in a Rembrandt Flight Into Egypt to make up for all they left out:  I expect somebody lecturing on Rembrandt will find an unexpected Wright of Derby . . .

Yesterday I finished almost all my long chapter called The Bathos.  A few finishing touches remain to be applied, that's all.  I have discovered a whole new aspect of Hogarth's work:  tell no one but he has a proto-romantic mood at the end.

Tell Tiny To send me details about the length of the material damaged, the extent of the harm, &c. as Hinds have promised a credit note if it is spoiled.  Tell me how much is ruined.  Let Tiny write herself.

   Dew settles on a rose, each drop as clear

   To boast of the pink captive, we won it.

   Using the tender hackneyed image, rose,
   And is refreshed, a book, we never close,
   And on its clasp, look, there is blood not rust.

   Obscure and fascinating, albums
   Recording a collective deathless theme,
   By pirate, cavalier, and decadent,
   Open for every lover as if Time
   Had never won from Cupid the engagement

ination.  I had written 'roses' on the top of it and must have supposed
you would never see it.  But here it is, a part of the hom-

Dearest Sylvia,

If Michael is going back to the gallery I think it is a good
thing. But I hope you will not hang upon his decision for if
 you do I fear that he will go on being ambivalent for the rest
of our days. I love you. This period without you is so difficult to bear for I desire so much to be with you.

I went to Tooth's yesterday and saw Devis, Hayman, Zoffany,
and Guardi. The latter's pictures were two Island Capriccios.  
This title charmed me and suggested images which eventually developed into this poem which has a bearing on use now. The deep
sea with its beasts is our loveless past, the shore our future
together - the lagoon of stanza two, between the water and the
Island (of Cythera) is where we are now, in sight of satisfaction but not yet landed.

The green fathoms diminish,
Our wake lingers
Upon the hollow sea,
Where whales of solitude 
Buttress the dim halls
And octopi hunger for roses.

Nearing an island
We see the coral floor,
Rising from the dark,
Yield to the sun,
Vivid and elegant.

The waves flutter
On golden shelves of sand
Beside the conches,
Wind moves the feathered trees
Coloured by fruit galore:
These symbols welcome lovers.

Viewed on the map, among
Dolphins and decollated winds,
The island and the sea
Lack names, but lovers know
Their future and their past.

     I saw Johnson (made him come to the Hong-Kong instead of the Salad-
Bowl) and he said how nice it was at Pett but told a lover none of the
things he wanted to know. Didn't even say what you wore...

ling. Thank you for it.

Dearest Sylvia:

Many thanks for your letter. The critic in me more than the poet was appealed to by your polemics. The only bit that seems to me answerable is about your insecurity. Your feeling of insecurity, I should say, and prefer to say.

'So precarious is the intimacy which suspends solitude,

that when talking to a dwarf whom I encountered in the des-

erted foyer of a derelict hotel, we decided to collaborate

on a study of the erotic fallacy. Like a rope, linking

two oceans liners steaming on parallel courses, which will

snap at the slightest divergence of either vessel, is the 

bond of what is popularly called love'.

Now that quotation is from a group of prose-poems that I wrote two summers ago and it is typical of my old attitude which also produced the Autumn poem you already know. If you compare it with any of the poems I have written since I have loved you, even the slightest of them, and you have them all, you will see the difference, the reorientation you have caused. You must see that where I am concerned you have no need for anxiety at all. Really my only fear is that my devotion may become boring.

My chances of passing the exam can be gauged by the fact that I have not heard of Stanislas' works at Nancy. However I shall console myself by writing poems in the exam. about a fellow student.

I must assure you that your view of Mother's attitude toward me is very wrong and that it was necessary to get you out of mother's mind quickly. From Molly I heard there is even possibility of disinheritance if anything serious ...&c.

I enjoyed the lecture yesterday. That may mean something.

Dearest Sylvia:

I am so distressed to hear that your neuralgia is back.  I was afraid it might be when you said your neck ached after the examination.  All I can say is what you said to me in your nice letter which I received this morning - 'I hope you will rest and sleep well'.  And I see from the end of your letter that the walk to the sea with Michael has not made any difference.  Oh, Sylvia, I hope you are well by now.

I am glad that The Rectory Umbrella helped with the journey and I need not tell you my feelings when you say you read it on Sunday morning instead of going to church.  Good.

I had forgotten that Josette Day in part of La Belle et la Bete wore her hair in a ring-bun, x like yours.  And she has your hairline and neck.  It was wonderful to find these little confirmations outside the actual narrative which is full of congenial allusions.  I thought it poignant: the symbolised need of love in la bete.  Do you remember the duologues before the great fire in which the Courtier imperceptibly vanquishes the animal and then, later, in the glade, when a deer flashes, and up to his ears and his shoulders hunch...  And the symbolism when la belle observes him guzzling water and shaking himself: somehow Cocteau suggests the action might have shocked her and that it is important than it doesn't.  You see what is implied: compare it, solitary, animal, with her father's careful preparation before sipping the wine in the beast's palace, and the formal toast.  Oh, and lots more.

I went to Little Stanmore church yesterday and really it was a treat.  Verrio (pupils of), Bellucci, and Laguerre - all are represented, and there is one of the proudest 18th century monuments I have ever seen - to the Duke of Chandos and his two wives.  A lot of the information in Whiffen's Stuart and Georgian Churches is incorrect, however, as long talks with the Verger proved.  He is a charming and witty old man and he tells a very funny story of some Swiss Girls he showed round the church recently.  They came to the Mausoleum which is half marble, half wood painted to resemble stone.  He banged on the wooden portion and (here he illustrated what he did) threw his voice most skillfully: 'what do you want' and old man's voice wheezed.  And then he scampered over to the other side of the room and banged again: 'Now what is it' another voice squeaked.  The Swiss girls are firmly believed now that there are re-

",0.2,FALSE
10931594,gri_2003_m_46_b01_f04_022.jpg,"sidents in the walls of the mausoleum.  The hollow bang on the wood and his ventriloquist really had a slightly eerie effect, even though he was telling it as a joke.

Afterwards I went to Chelsea Hospital and saw Grinling Gibbons' Charles II and the great painting by Verrio and Cook of Charles II in front of the hospital surrounded by allegorical figures.  It has just been cleaned.  You must certainly see both these and I hope also Saint Lawrence's church too someday soon.

Your reference to your walk to the sea brings back a lot of memories to me also:  really Pett is becoming a kind of Atlantis or Eldorado to  me richly charged with vivid pleasures.  It was very fine and yet there was a hard wind from the sea on our day.  How different from the heavy scented day you describe.  How I look forward to seeing Pett again (Pett l[unclear]ev[/unclear]el, too) beyond your profile, or over your shoulder.  past your adorable hair.  What good news that the rushes are growing again - as you said they would.  Do you know the Princess Toutebelle?  She is a character from a fairy tale who was turned into a palm tree by the Yellow Dwarf on the day she was to marry the King of the Gold Mines.  I think I shall try and write something about her and put her into a Pett landscape.  If I do I think you might like to do some illustrations.  A blend of the pale rose and the owl with one-eye (standing for the two levels of reality, in the garden and in imagination) would be just what is needed.  What do you think?  Something like this would not require much effort and it would be fun.

  Here is an evening poem about Pett:  called, At The Rectory.

     Cool elongated phantoms fall
     Sideways across the lawn
     Plaintively recognising frailty
     And moaning the lack of physical love
     No bodies hot and rocking,
     Shunted and bruised by zephyrs these
     Phantoms falling vague away
     Unruled by Gravity
     Which gives such weight to lovers and their flesh

And here is a poem which I have only just finished but which I started in Paris and continued in the train on my way back.

     Voices and footsteps from the street
     Echo in this one o'clock
     An owl sits on the Eiffel Tower
     Its wings caress the sleepy poet",0.2,FALSE

My dearest Sylvia,

I have been noting down one or two references to roses I have come across in poetry I have read and I thought you might like to see them.

1. O my Luve's like a red, red rose
That's newly sprung in June.

2. The blude red rose at Yule may blow
The simmer-lilies bloom in snow,
The frost may freeze the deepest sea,
But an auld man shall never daunton me.

Those are by Burns. The next by Wallace Stevens (vice - president of the Hartford Assurance Company or something like that):

3. Compare the silent rose of the sun
And rain, the blood-rose living in its smell,
With this paper, this dust...

        Roses and Death:
That is the theme for this letter.  I was
struck when noting down rose image
for you how often the precious frag-
ments I loose  and isolated by quot-
ation, sensual and pleasurable in
themselves, were belied by the context.
It seemed that few poets could cele-
brate the rose and what it symbol-
ises without giving their lyric a
sense of duration, placing it in
time, recording their rose's decay, destruc-
tion, as, at best, contenting them-
selves with a warning.  Thus it was",0.2,FALSE
10931629,gri_2003_m_46_b01_f05_037.jpg,"rose has become a temporal image. In
my own poetry at least it is, again,
a sensual symbol, undying and
un-threatened, its victory ensured
through renewal. It is red. It is a
flower. 'My luv is like a red red rose'.
These are perhaps self evident things
to assert; ought to be, but there is
material for a manifesto in them.
Death is cultivated by so many; pes
simism is banal and promiscuous,
shared as the basis of Sartre's system is
by the [unclear]miras[/unclear] poets of 400 years, and by
the guarded, libido-constipated [unclear]bour-[/unclear]
[unclear]geois[/unclear]. How indignant I am. But

very well and have even tried to add
an original variation to the theme you
showed me. Nobody seems to have recognised this symptomatic and systemative abuse of
a key image.",0.2,FALSE

The book you mention on the English court would be a delight though I do see a vast amount of work as being necessary and a most expensive number of trips to private collections - [Chatsworth] is only one that comes to mind.  Also, I like very well the suggested political conclusions and I wonder, here, how far we would agree - just how far you would agree to come with me toward total monarchy's attitude toward the masses.  And even an implicit condemnation of our present stolid, boring Royal Family for being 'above suspicion'.  What [dawning] vistas of ideas are opened by your suggestion.  We should have to try and get one of the 45 suites at Hampton Court to write it in, I think.

Yesterday I went to London for the first time for weeks and saw Fuseli again, Sutherland's new work, and David Jones' new collection of which I enclose one illustration, all I could get.

FRIDAY      11 Mansel Road   Wimbledon

My dearest Sylvia:

   Today I went to Hampton Court.  The customary memories charmed and disquieted me.  I wondered where you went to-day.  I suppose you have visited the Louvre.  I imagine that is an early step:  were you there at eleven?  I looked hard at my watch and wondered.  I write in a room littered with papers:  outside there are roses and the squeak of children.  The typewriter drowns them.  Have you sat in the Boulevard cafes I wonder, sipping a cold drink, looking at people, and saying why haven't they anything like it in England.  I always said that.  I always do that as soon as I can once I get to Paris.  Paris, London:  London, Paris.  My tea-tray is one the floor:  dregs of china tea.  And you are where:  how many miles of water, how many of a different gauge railway, are there separating us?  However I am fairly cheerful:  I am so busy for one thing.  And there is your August visit.  Imagination superimposes you on familiar Paris streets:  the admirable Place de la Concorde (see it in the evening when the sun catches every lamp!) and, just by it, the Jeu de Paume.  The Impressionist pictures:  how well they fit, most of them, with the scenes that meet your eyes in the Tuileries outside.  (Except for some of the animal bronzes.)  The children, the families, the iron chairs:  it is by the fountain that I first read Proust.  Dearest, I see I have quite forgotten to ask, did you have a nice trip:  are you well now?  What a trial to travel just at that time.

   There is considerable doubt in my mind whether you will be at the Hotel Racine but I suppose I may as well write as if you certainly will be.  Then:  I love you.  I have written a sonnet for you:  Cynthia is what Elizabeth was called by Raleigh.  She was flattered cosmically as if she were the sun, centre of the macrocosm, &c.  All of that is referred to here, and shifted to apply to you.

    Promote you Cynthia, easy
   You meet the flatterer half-way
   By being as you are lovely,
   Nearest to angels in the chain.

   I do not call, for a rime's sake,
   Sylvia Cynthia, but for
   The allusions that it brings,
   Complex macrocosmic matters.

   Masques in your honor would describe
   You centre of the court and sky
   With emblematic characters
   Grateful to be eclipsed by you.

   Dancing you move universally
   Silent your repose is Ptolemy's

(Ptolemy's universe had a flat earth &c.)

   I love you, love you,
      Lawrence

P.S.  Dearest, do let me know about your exam results.  I have [unclear]tasked[/unclear] (no distinction) but since the letter is headed Final Examination I take it that I am safe.  I thought you would have sent me a card with the news before you left England.",0.2,FALSE

Dearest Sylvia:
I am so afraid that declarations
of love may seem repetitious and
it is a difficulty one encounters if,
loving strongly and continuously,
one's only direct communication
is by means of letters, at best shad-
ows of what I want to say, and frag-
ments of my love. Still, letters it
has to be... And I shall say again
you are never out of my mind. It
is a surprise sometimes to realise
how many places we have been together: concrete memories of you are
evoked by places as far apart as Greenwich and Hampton court, Victoria and
[unclear]Fullers[/unclear] at Wimbledon. And, as to-
day, the Tate gallery. Though you
were, my dear Sylvia, very tired

you had your twice weekly excursion to town. I am not being heartless, really, it was dreadful for
you I know, but you, too, know",0.2,FALSE

for you richly deserve them. One rather good reason is that you wear them so well.

When I opened my bedroom door and leant across the bed to put the light on, the rich heavy perfume of our two roses [unclear]weighted[/unclear] and sweetened the air. I shall sleep tonight with them beside me. Talking of roses I am pleased you liked my room better.

I must thank you for your gifts of food. As cook you know how valuable they were. But what I must really thank you for is coming so soon to see me. I do know what a trial it is and I know your divided loyalty must be painful. I did not intend to be so emotional because it may worry you but, as you know, it was involuntary. Do not fear, though, because seeing you again, being soothed and charmed and satisfied by you after a long gap, has made me better. Tonight, happy (sad, calm) longing, all those things I am, yet they are I think somewhat balanced. So do not feel angst on my behalf, your love has helped me where your absence upset me.

Dearest Sylvia, Bath/Monday
I was wrong. The last letter you received from me was not
the last one from Bath, but this one will be. I leave this afternoon.
Landor called Bath the 'English Florence' - in one respect, at least,
I can say he's wrong - the people. They are resolutely unhandsome &
dull. Not at all what Landor's expression leads one to expect. I
saw Prior Park yesterday. I will tell you about it when we meet.
Really, why I write this letter is because I feel a little sad at the
thought of you being in London yet in some ways so distant from me.
Tomorrow I will try and book for Crime [unclear]Parrionel[/unclear] for the1st. I expect I shall be able to get something. I love you, love you, very
much, and your doubts and fears have only increased my desire
for you and for considerations under which such feelings would not be possible. Don't forget Tiny's anxiety about Clifford's position when 
you think of Clifford's advice for you: despite himself he may be
have been influenced. I'm sure you thought of this, darling. You
are in my thoughts, not only at eleven, but throughout the day and
night. when alone I long for you, when with people I find myself consciously wishing for you instead of them, when enjoying this place I
imagine how you would enjoy it also. Today at eleven I had just
been to see a reconstruction of Minerva's temple in Sydney Gardens.

doing a household task, deliciously pink as you polished or dusted.",0.2,FALSE

Dearest Sylvia,
What a good idea to collaborate, you and I, on Wright of
Derby or Dobson. I should adore to, not only for the reasons
that come first to mind (I am a lover first, then a critic, I
admit it), but because it would produce something excellent.
I often wish as I do this book for your opinion on a multitude of points. Obviously it is not possible as things are
at present between Michael, Sylvia, and Lawrence. But how I
should love to work with you. Without you I shall only go
on for a limited time writing books - with you I should have
the motif to be more energetic.
Good, oh, good, you are painting again. Dandylion is
delighted. But - 'Michael likes it so far you say. 'So
far'. And what happens when he stops liking it? Do not,
darling, be dependant on Michael's approval or disapproval,
anymore than you are on Tiny's funny opinions. I know he
is more likely to be right than Tiny, but it is rather as if
a Poussin were always at the elbow of a Rubens, and Rubens,
instead of telling Poussin to keep to his own kind of paint-
ing, accepted his advice and toned down, modified, corrected,
adjusted, his own vigorous conceptions which are alien to
the other painter. Look at your own development this year
and you can do so with complacency I think: do you ascribe
this progress to Michael's advice or to yourself.
Your new material sounds charming and I anticipate very
pleasurably seeing you in it.
I am so glad you like my sonnet and that you have bought
a notebook for my poem. Your comparison of the sonnet with
Fubert was exactly right but I must say I thought Michael's
suggestion of Chiswick House ridiculous. Pyramid, colonnade,
Campagna, Rome; does this recall Chiswick which is after all
about to be restored? The Bath poem is still as it was at
Bath because I have just not had time to do more than revise
one or two bits and pieces. When it is done you shall have
the first copy. I love you and must write many more poems.
About the library tickets: do you think you could renew
them yourself by post, telling them that you divide your time
between town and country? Otherwise they may simply tell you
to join the Pett Public Library. Sorry to put you to this
trouble but it would be of considerable help to this author.
Where can I get opinions if I can't read library books after all?
I love you. I shall write you a note at the end of the day's
work this evening. It is 9.30 now and I must get down to H.
I love you.

Dearest Sylvia,

Well, I got my steak as I hoped, and so kept my strength up for work. Then Mother came home and I got a second lunch though more modest. I did not tell her of the first.

There is the smell of paint &c. about at present because Ricky is painting a portrait of Mother, in her red cross things. It reminds me very acutely and wistfully of the studio in which I sat for my portrait and the painter to whom I sat. Perhaps you have been in your studio this afternoon. I imagined you there.

I love you, Sylvia. Do not doubt me. I look forward very excitedly to our meeting next Saturday. I will send you a cheque. Come by train it is quicker and it will make your return home less precise. You know what I mean. And I can come to East Croyden. Oh, Sylvia, I love you. Your letters do help me with their charm and their love and their news.

Your account of filling in the landscape of our picture suggested the following poem to me:

SYLVIA AS FLORA

As Flora spends her avalanche of flowers
On hills and hollows of the country
So you my painter, lover, pagan,
Populate the canvas with your signs.

Your various disguises, none of them designed to confuse but only delight with variety, of Minerva, Painter, Cat, and more, are a symbol of the rich pleasure I find in your presence. O dearest I love you.

Have you seen the new King Penguin of Dürer woodcuts? It is splendid value for half-a-crown. I have been tremendously excited by it.

I can now call you a villain: what a delightfully startling suggestion that there may be some rubbed paint at the lips of my portrait. I think the best thing is not to go on with your painting to correct this but make your model resemble your image. Nature catching up Art, &c. We shall prove it, darling.

EMBLEMATA AMATORIA

Along the silver bourn
A boat for lovers moves
Steered by the boy of love
Past willow palaces
And islands shaped like trophies
Parting the current's hair.

And in the boat we lie
Embracing as we traverse
The double landscape, 
Lisping among the reeds, 
Escorted by Desire - 
The feathered messenger.

Swans glide like ambassadors
Before our boat and doves
Flutter like warm fans around
The sunflower on our flag.

There is a ruined city:
It is the past, and as we look
Left over a lawn of lilies
It burns like Sodom and is gone.

On the other bank temptation sports
Alluring livery, a feast
To honour only one of us,
Attended by kings and singers.

But these rejected with a kiss
We reach a gallant garden
Where there are mazes, every turn 
Leading to the rose's centre,
Knot gardens fashioned on your name,
And peacocks boasting of our love.

Now Cupid tends the bees,
Or works with bellows for a wind,
Or shoots an arrow at a flower:
Always in the garden are
A beauty seated at her easel,
A poet reading as she works.

Thank you for your letters which came this morning. I was very happy to have them. The one you wrote on the 19th only came today with the one dated yesterday. So you see there had been a long gap.

I am so pleased you like my poems. May I say, in return. how delightfully you receive them. I think that my poems are symbolised by the mirror I hold in our portrait, the mirror reflecting your garlanded head.

Your black-berry leaves sound lovely. I do look forward to receiving a painting. You are spoiling me, I am glad to say, for you know  how I adore your work.  Have you done anything to your profile in our portrait?

Too bad about Lines' secretary. Is that the woman who paid me? All I can remember about her is her saying: `Aren't you nervous? I would be. Don't you feel nervous before a lecture? Don't you mind. Oh, I would', and so on.

I must correct Johnson´s account of Dennis and I who can more accurately be described as separable companions.

I went to Hampton Court again yesterday and saw a new picture - an early 18th century view of the whole layout. There were charming knot gardens between the river and palace (trees now mainly) and in front of the palace a fine collection of fountains. Alas, no more.

My plan for rooms was, if my enquiries among friends is fruitless, to look round in the ten days or so before Christmas and then, if I found somewhere suitable, take it, so we could move in soon after. It would only mean paying rent without being there for a short period then. What do you think?

Dearest, I long for you. I love you.

Dearest Sylvia,

Thank you for the gloves. It is a proud and warm Dandylion who defies the weather now. They are just the right size, a nice colour, and I am delighted with them. How promptly they came, my darling, thank you. Do thank Tiny very much. Would you order a slip-over for me? I do not mind waiting till after Christmas. I need one because I only have wind-cheaters and sweater and one of those is for you. I can't find a tape-measure but will definitely send measurements in my next letters. 

I enclose ten shillings to pay Tiny and do keep the rest in part payment of the money you had to use on Tuesday. I have looked up Knole and think we would be advised to wait till we are together before visiting it. So the week after next I will just come to Hastings for a day if you agree.

I am most concerned that you feel tired and depressed. I hope you have thrown this off by now. Look after yourself, as you say to me.

difficult position, but you must be
prepared to act out as loving me when
MIchael is nice as well as when he is
not. Do not think I do not feel

the beauty editor of Britannia and Eve if you see what I

what pleasure it gave Dandylion. He is wearing a
new blue bow this morning and your letter has made
him very happy. TheWhite Owl kept his secret well
and did not tell me, until today, that he had already
sat to you for his portrait. When I opened the
letters he fluttered impatiently: 'Well', he said,
'Recognize who it is?' I did instantly. And
what a dear, voluptuous rose. Darling Sylvia, thank
you.

you would like to see instead and I'll book as soon as
I return. What about Eileen Herlie's Medea. Do tell
me.

   I wish I had more time in this letter but soon I must
go to London with Mother. In my new bow. And that 
reminds me: are you intending to lengthen your dress
 with the Italian material for your visit here? I think

Dearest Sylvia,
Today I went to Wells and spent several hours in
and outside the Cathedral. It is the most intensive study
of a major Gothic work I have made and I must say I
am very struck by the detail as well as the irregular
whole. It is especially  rich, as you know, in sculpture,
and I saw also of course the splendid Chapter House, and
the fine support for the central tower - you remember,
the arcs and inverted arcs  How exciting spatially
it makes nave and transepts. Some of these observations
make rather familiar reading I'm afraid but I am genuinely 
excited by Gothic for about the first time.
Naturally I understand about the dates 30th or 1st.
Let me know which so that I can book in time (Sartre or 788 Fente?).  I shall go back
to Wimbledon on the 27th, next Monday evening. I hope to
see over Prior Park on Sunday - that is why I am delaying
my return until then.

Dearest Sylvia,

Do you realize that you have written 70 letters to me? (I exclude one formal note instructing me about my first visit to Pett.) I must have sent you as many and yet this letter is the one most difficult to write. If I am clumsy please remember another earlier letter in which I have pleased you. Remember what must be about 100 poems.

I love you, Sylvia. You came to me last night. Why did I not accept it at that? Because my heart struggles for a complete expression of love. Because the strain of waiting and hoping has been so difficult. I was ruthless. Forgive the pain I caused you. It is all mine now. Remember, and do believe, that, although I have hurt you, I hope for your happiness. Do not doubt my love. I love you and will never stop. I love you.

It is a terrible day for your return to Pett. But I hope that once there you will attain, out of your present indifference, ease. I hope with all my heart for the tranquility which I have done much to imperil. But, do not put all the blame on me: circumstances, and not only Lawrence, are guilty. 

I believe what I learned last night has not been in vain and I trust you so that I know it is not too late.

Although I welcomed you to London with some poems I can't say much about your departure because I am disturbed. May I give you two quotations:

From town fair Arabella flies;
The beaux unpowder'd grieve. (T. Parnell)

Oh, for some other fear than this! 
Love is leaving town. (Charles H Ford)

Remember how we disagreed amiably in the past on artistic matters? Our love can survive mistakes too.

I love you, I love you.

Dearest Sylvia,

My love, how I long for you as I got about my day to day motions without you. Today at the B.M. I imagined your pleasure at the illuminated manuscripts and your appreciative comments on the porcelain at which I especially looked. I remembered, as I walked to see John Skipp, how we had walked in this neighbourhood, you pointing out fanlights and such details to me, on our way to St Pancras Church.

Skipp gave me the names of half a dozen people to let in touch with about lectures. If a project of his own comes off I shall get about seven lectures at factories (!) but this is not yet fixed. The pay will be 2 or 3 guineas. It is an encouraging prospect. And Johnson has got two lectures for me at the N.G. this month, both to schools - one, I think, the young ladies' finishing school we joked about!

Skipp has lent me Ronald Firbank's Prancing Nigger a book which I've wanted to read for ages. Do you know it? He say I must read Tea With Mrs Goodman which I recall you admired.

The way your painting is developing makes Dandylion proud of you for in oils are more structural and in watercolour you are more fluent - a two-fold advance.

I used your library tickets today and nobody raised a shocked eyebrow and said: 'Mrs...? Greenwood'. I got a book in which Elizabethan poetry is called 'Formal' and 'luxurious'. These are two qualities I like in my verse. I hope you are not tired of garden and landscape poems for here is just one more...

Surely roses rob the sun
To grow so fat, so red,
They hide the arbour
Where lovers loll.

On an immaculate shelf of turf.

Who would have thought, turning the book of hours
That was his order, that the cloister;s

Had grown and hidden every saint.

Soon I must go out and cash my cheque, buy some writing materials, so that I can write to people for lectures and reviews. After that I shall do some more Hogarth. Will you paint today I wonder. I hope so. I agree with you really about your books but be sure to bring sufficient painting things with you, despite transport or other obstacles, you must be equipped with materials.

Dearest Sylvia, I love you, I am ravished by your body in movement, in repose; by your wit and your tenderness, by your art and your criticism.

Dearest Sylvia,
I went to St. Albans on Friday and saw the Museum (The
enclosed postcard shows one of the mosaics), the church
with Bacon's monument that we failed to get in at, and a 
fine Roman amphitheatre. A drawing of Dandylion here will
be found in this letter. In the morning Gillet (Education
Officer from St Albans) and I put up the exhibition
in the Congregational Chapel at Redbourn. Soon I'll
send you a sketch of it. As you guess it is a pretty
19th century building. The first day, Saturday, when
we opened was dull: Sunday I was there from
2 till 5 and had about 20 people, including children.
Much of the time children scuffled in the tiny lobby
shooting away when I invited them in, returning a few
minutes later, giggling, fidgeting, bolting again. A
Committeewoman - Mrs williams - haunts the place: when
I am showing people round, discussing pictures, in she
comes and starts questioning them about their name, home,
relatives, &c. She is a village busy body of bureaucratic
thoroughness and paranoiac simplicity. She has a discreet
hair lip and a face as long as a Red Indian totem head.
The other day Gillet took me to lunch in the Factory
at which school dinners are made - 2000 a day. Before
having an excellent meal I was invited to inspect the 
kitchens. Feeling like the Minister in the Small Back
Room I was escourted along a great vista full of 
pale women, puffs of grey steam, complicated ovens, and
hams. The store house is in one of those old orange
Georgian houses fronting the main road at Redbourn which
we looked at. Under a rather decadent Adamesque ceiling
are sacks, tins, boxes of food. The centre of interest is 
a relief of the Judgment of Solomon (John Nost school I 
imagine).
The old ladies who have relieved me for tea at Harpenden
all carried, I have just learned, a pepper pot. Having heard
some reproductions have been stolen they feared further raids
and the idea was if a man should burst in and try to 
carry off any part of the exhibition his designs would be 
frustrated by having pepper thrown at him. Possibly they
had hatpins and knees ready also . . .   The tension under
which these poor things must have laboured while I had
leisurely tea, often reading Henry James, is painful to
imagine . . .

Sunday I talked with a background of music, such as is heard in the cinema in particularly romantic scenes of renunciation. The sunday school was in the hall, separated from the exhibition only by a thin partition. 'This is John Piper. It's called Abstract', I would say and then the children would scream a hymn ever louder. 'It's called Abstract', I would shout. 'Abstract'. Later I heard the teacher instructing the victims to 'Thank god for mummy'. 'Thank god for school.' 'Thank god for Dinner' &c. The sacrificial blood poured from under the door...
Yesterday afternoon the Women's Fellowship turned up for their tea party and several old ladies were faced with breakdowns and tears when they discovered their usual routine had to be adjusted because of the exhibition. However, they soon recovered & were singing away lustily between cups of tea, somebody played the piano for them. The weight of 2 pictures on the door of the room forced the door, imperfectly latched, open. The ladies, I saw, were packed in rows, all wearing identical hats, this shape , and steel rimmed glasses: they were motionless except for their lips & wobbling chins as they sang.

SYLVIA IN THE ORCHARD

Medallions of light
Start through the foliage
Likenesses of Apollo

Like chiffon at your throat
The blossom curls and crinkles

Your blossom is the frontispiece
Of a summer full of fruit
Of poems ripened in the sun
Falling into baskets of rhymes

Nervous and felicitous
Your blossom lies on the page
Like the blossom on the sky

When in a globe of wool
Flesh sacrificed its sweat;
So with the thinnest cover
Get ready for your sleep, pull
The cover to your hips, or get
Hot and nervous to the window.

That only now repairs
The fever and the cloud's weight:
Like someone rising from the sea,
A beauty mounting stairs,
A wind lifts a corner of the night
To splash us in our windows.

4 SOME WAYS OF LOOKING AT A LANDSCAPE

Suppose the landscape is a desert
Where ruins shoulder rocks aside like dirt:
Conceive it as an asymmetric plot
As Tudor as you like. Or has it got
The long low english character of downs:
Perhaps a church subscribes a hat for clowns
Phallic or heavenly. A choice agrees
With predisposed pathetic fallacies.
The view to us has an empathic quiver
And shows our own reflections like a river:
But I will take the place on pagan terms,
Establish Pan in every bush and urn,
And advertise for dryads in the trees.]That is one choice of several fallacies.

5 SONG

The earthquake in my heart removed
The gothic city and the plain
Littered with temples of my pain.
Your love the first destroyer proved.

Your love was next an architect
Who sets up ports and open squares
To catch the sunlight and the air.
The city was your will intact.

Return my love to empty graceful streets
Designed by you, these tubs of flowers,
And sun that gilds the slender towers.
We'll meet at time's triumphal gate.

I hope you are well my dearest creature and that
you are painting. Tell me again what canvases you
would like beside the one for the sequel to Venus.

I have written two unrhymed sonnets about ourselves
in this summer landscape: first LATE SUMMER:

The Summer is a palinode
To the Spring's uncertainties:
The sudden storm that pricked flat
Like a harsh unshaven chin
The promising bed of flowers
And dark regressive afternoons
Of the silence of the postmen.

This warm delaying epilogue
Extends to Autumn Summer's bribe
Of a sundae of bright fruit:
The longer nights are cooler but
The vivid climate lingers.
Sunbathing among the crisp trophies
We catch a brown leaf on the thigh.

And, THE GARDEN:

Summer bribed the fruit and evenings
To be welcome to the lovers:
The fallacies of war
Are implicit in the ruin,
Shattered green-house, aimless vane,
But these trophies are defeated 
By the attributes of Ceres,
Orchards rampant on the sky
On a clement azure series.

Dearest Sylvia, 
Your two letters have just come and thank you for them so much. Especially the first one which is charming and loving. You must read the poems once more for you have misread In Defence of Water if you find anything of dissatisfaction it it. It is a description of how happy I was loving you, expressed in terms as if Water were a neglected minor painter whom we wished to re-
habilitate. Certainly the obne about Time was divided but not the other: read it again immediately, please.

Enunciated by the stones

Syntax is the beachbound shells

Fruit abundant rings us round,
luxurious and bright,
Divided frequently - and often phallic.

No diminutive, regressive

I thought of you yesterday morning, painting Ruth: it is the only painting of yours I have not seen yet. I hope this sitting went agreeably. There has been a slight delay but I should have Twelve Masterpieces any moment: do you want it sent to you at Pett or, if it should not come till the end of the week, kept here for you? By the way, have you made those last touches to Tiny or, as I suppose, have you lacked sufficient leisure? It is a very good portrait I think.

Dearest Sylvia,

Here is a poem for you, not, I am afraid, any of
the ones we discussed but another about The Five
Senses.  You know yourself how sometimes when one
sets out to create something one holds consciously
in mind, something else is easier for the moment.
So it was with this poem, but I am gathering the
images, the words, for the other poems and I hope,
over Christmas, to be able to send you some more.
The Figureheads poem in particular is shaping well
but it is rather critical of the masses rather than
appreciative of love and poetry - so it is not a
suitable seasonal gift.  I hope that this new
poem (all riming except the envoi ) will convey my
good-will, my love, and my appreciation of experiences we have shared which provide the imagery of 
it.

I have received a letter from Worsley (literary Editor of the Statesman) in which he says my review
is 'written with skill and with knowledge' but he
feels it is not suitable for the New Statesman as
it is rather specialised.  However, this is not as
gloomy as it sounds because he says to ring him up
and go and have a talk with him about it.  There is,
still, I like to think hope.

I have not yet received any letters from you but,
then, the posts are quite phantastic at present.
One at ten, another at ten-thirty, then a prolonged
silence.  I hope you get mine fairly regularly.

Yesterday I got a shirt, not a grey and white bengal stripe, but a pale brown and white: it was the
only kind I was able to find.  I think it is rather
nice and will look delicious with my new bow, which
it will show up to great advantage.",0.1666666667,FALSE

I do hope that you find there is not too much work to do at Pett and that you have a Christmas rather like the Mediterranean version mentioned in Taste. That is my intention for I shall be leaving my mind and my balls at Blackheath.

Paul and I last night saw Les Amants de Verone which, despite some unsatisfactory features, is, broadly, an affecting and beautiful film. There are some charming shots of Venice, in particular one from S. Giorgio Maggiore, where we used to sit, read, and paint. Death, as usual in French films, is the final stage of the story though more reluctantly than in Cocteau's films. The young man is killed by the family of the girl he loves: 'Where has it got them', the girl asks. 'Where' and cuts her wrists to die with him. At least death was not their aim.

The editor of the A.I.A. news-letter (which I hope to re-organise somewhat later) wants me to write about the French landscape exhibition. No payment but I will do, of course.

My dove, my beauty, I adore you, and I long to fill all your stockings with gifts so I shall shower more poems on you very soon. I love you so much, I never stop thinking about you, and you become more adorable every day. Ravishing Minerva, I wish you a very nice Christmas and lots to eat.

Here is a copy of World Review which I hope you will show to the Woods for they thought of the Christian symbolism. Many of the other symbols  you detected and, if it were possible in such a short article, I would give you all acknowledgements. Last week I received ten guineas for the Third Man and it is this that has kept your lion's head above water.

(I did not expect, by the way, ever to be in a paper with Jaspers...)

I envy you your lecture on Heredity by Clifford, just as I envy C. having so intelligent and beautiful a cat in his audience.

Yesterday evening, after all the lectures etc., of which I told you yesterday I went to Paul's flat which is charming and met various hat-designing or theatrical queers - one of whom I settled down to talk about Venice with. He had lived on S. Giorgio Maggiore. I caught the last train and was very tired last night but I am fine today and shall settle down this afternoon and evening to psycho-analyse H's aesthetics in relation to the fore-pleasure of his pictures. 

I must go and shop or half the day will be gone.

A short note - on this venerable note-paper - to send my love. I have just given two lectures - here - the public one on El Greco in the morning and then the photographers - between which I sandwiched the Max Ernst exhibition, which I am doing for Art News.

8th May, 1950

The Antimasque:

A Street in London.  enter Lion who dances before
several shops; he speaks:
Easy to give her, apples knocked from trees
That overhang the country lover's path
Easy to give her wishes for her health
And hope that she will never fall in the brook,
With all her clothes on, even in the Summer.
What present can I give my Sylvia?

A song by Dustjacket:
Memoirs of Mlle. de Temps,
A limited edition.
Giorgione's 'Microcosm'
A complete file of 'transition'?

A guide book to the chateau
Where fountains carry fruit;
The measurements of statues
On south Italian sites?

Odes by Forrest, 'How to Swim',
Dryden's Aeneid, Mrs. Behn,
'I married the Fisher-King'
Ripa-hard to obtain.

Lion:
I have marked too many anniversaries with volumes, pedantically: why give more books to Minerva when it is
from her that authors take their inspiration?

A Song by [unclear]Florna:[/unclear]
The brave hyacinth
Stands like a hero on a plinth:

Is not Racine but voyages:
Over the range of metaphor
Into the ranch of things.

Geography so honours
The green vase of a voyage

Are mirrors of things.

Are not even, voyages
To you are more than metaphors
But have the status of a thing.

Guide to life and death.

He will fly,

Through your lips
With his beating wings.

Above a fort of love;
Four seasons it resisted:
By four winds blustered,
But still it flew above
That happy garrison.

Hair from the likeness
Of the god at Delos.
Here is a sign of Venus;
From a dove harnessed
To her chariot, a feather.

You may repair,

Dearest Sylvia,
This letter must be fairly hurried I'm afraid not more than a note.  I am
in Charles' office at the N.G.  He wants me to take Friday's public lecture so I have to do a little preparation.
The subject is Italian masterpieces IV - and most of the master-
pieces have been used up in the preceding three talks.
Is not the weather vile!  However, there is a bright aspect of it - for once a rainy day when I have NOT just
been to [unclear]Carsons[/unclear].  I think I must wait until after Whitsun.
Poor Clifford and Marjorie - I'm afraid their holiday at Brighton
will be sadly interfered with by the [unclear]inetdar[/unclear] weather what
a shame.
I have some poems in progress - a longish one, and the topographical piece, as well as The Poet in the Garden.  It is too
early to send you any yet but I hope to work on them in bed
this evening after the AIA committee meeting - of which I
will send you news.
But now I must prepare my lecture - then, I shall not need to
come to town until after lunch which will be a good thing.

of you all the time - and miss you.

Dearest Sylvia,
I told Hetty of your dream and she blushed and said you must
have heard it from the owls (""they are always talking), but, she
said there is no truth in the rumor.  We must be responding in 
the same way to present occasions for I am having a sequence of
dreams which are disturbing.  I remember them only fragmentarily
but I keep losing you, in a large block of French apartments, in
a landscape, in a tangled mannerist figure composition.  To-
night I think I shall go late to bed because the early nights I have
had since you left seem incompatible with sleep.  Last night I
saw the Maggawate (spelling?) tower, already illuminated, at 9:14.
I thought of you as I always do when passing this to-be-painted
building.
I have not yet seen Charles to talk about Hogarth but I will
tell you when I do.
Today I am ^going^ to see N.G. to make notes for German Painting on Sat-
urday.  Yesterday's lecture (Jacopo di Cione, Agnolo Gaddi,
Pisanello, Wilton Diptych) was I think successful - full of sociology & definitions of gothic, as well as formal analysis.

a week in the Northern Region at the beginning of November.

'The Work of the Public : how to look at PIctures'.  I shall write
a note after this, accepting gleefully.
A fifth carnation has appeared, so that although I have cut off a dead
one it is still fine and ample.
I love you so much and longing/ for you with an indiscretion

gave you an encouraging lecture as I seem unable to.  I love
you, my dearest creature.  I shall think of you all day in

Dearest Sylvia 
How I wish you were here for I am going to the Barber again this morning to look at the pictures and I know we would have enjoy it. I shall think so tenderly of you as I see again the Murillo, the Rubens, the Gainsborough.
I could not afford lunch on the train yesterday so I did not eat between breakfast and dinner. However, the dinner, was really admirable: guinea fowl being the main course. I have just eaten a great breakfast & I shall also add lunch ot the University Account here before returning to London & dinner with Ithell Colquhoun. I have plenty to eat at home so do not worry, my dove.
My lecture began a little weakly I think but improved as it went on. Both Russell & Garlick said they had learned much from it: Lautrec really is an exciting & interesting figure. His influences include Uccello, Baldoniretti, Velasquez & Moroni, Brouwer, Breughel, Bosch, Daumier, mannerist and generally, Japanese colour prints etc. Do you know his late works? they are among his most impressive productions, concentrated & monumental.
 You will be glad to hear that Russell agrees with us (though, of course, I di not name you to him) that what modern art needs is a revival of History Painting. He is at work on some mythological panels even now.
By the way, in the draft of your article are various uncorrected spelling mistakes - all of which I set right in the MS I actually submitted. I mention that in case you re-read your version, & should feel worried.
I enclose at last 3 more poems for you. The Paradox in the longer one is the Paradox of the Fortunate Fall, put to non X-tian purposes, of course.

is due to start in about 15 minutes.  There is time to tell you
this thought, the feeling (the two absolutely coincide), that I love
you.  I adore you so much and wish that you were here.
Yesterday was not a strain really.  I met a psychiatrist (who employs Poises to instruct the mad in art) and I expect to meet him
again, he is very intelligent and nice.  He pointed out Francis
Bacon's single subject is castration fear.
I went to the R.B.A. exhibition and I cannot feel you have 
lost anything by missing the sending-in day.  Madeleine Pearson
said (when I met her there) that it was not as good as last year.  She
has two pictures in, but nothing looks nice in such dreary oppressive
company.
Have you had an opportunity by now to work on Tiny, the Savage, or
the Flight?  Do let me know of your work in this direction for they
are so nearly finished.

Wednesday to Saturday at the N.G. were too much and I bullied them (discreetly) into agreeing to a [unclear]solitary[/unclear] visit on the latter day.  My cat is the diplomatic

A letter and enormous form has come from the BBC and I have to attend an appointment, board about the television job on Monday week. I am rather excited by the prospect.

In each of the earlier letters I wrote to you, incidentally, I meant to say what I have remembered and am about to say now: your two new adaptations of your hats are absolutely delicious, both the blue on you wore to the lecture(!) and film show and the plume which you wore the day you left here. I do congratulate you about them. 

I have not got any sending-in forms for you yet but be assured I have not forgotten: I will have them all when you come. I will get forms for the R.I. of watercolourists tomorrow on Tuesday morning in time for 6th March (which is next Tuesday week). You ask which ones to",0.1666666667,FALSE
11751190,gri_2003_m_46_b04_f02_011.jpg,"send in. What about The Priory? I should think that is one they would like. Also I suggest the view of 109 Blackheath Park in the Wood Collection. I think that one of your latest watercolors of the Belrige Square interior would be worth submitting, too. That makes three which is perhaps one more than you can enter. The last word is yours but I hope this may help you to sort out the ones to send in from so many successful and beautiful examples.
   I will make the adjustments to my article that Clifford suggests. I am very pleased he likes it. When I have posted this letter I plan to write some of the Victorian sonnet article: films, too, I expect.
   I wonder if you have started yet on your water-color of the Wood's new possession. It is so exciting to think of new paintings by you progressing, enriching your oeuvre, even as I sit and write this. Miles away, across a rainy pattern of town and country, perhaps, a radiant image is forming at this moment.
   Alas, there are some SEA letters to write so I suppose I better get down to them. This paper shows that your lion also has headed paper of a fine professional character: Sylvia Sleigh and S. E. A. It means: Society for the Elevation of Animals (but only lions & cats, and elephants - or one elephant). Hetty loves your muff - & so does Dandy.
   I love you, my dearest one, I love you

I failed to find a pillar box on my way to Liverpool Street so I am able to add to my letter.
I passionately lament my shortage of money at present for, apart from the actual wonderful pleasures of being with you that it postpones, it interferes with your painting. How important your art is, - not only to your own psyche, - but in itself. Sometimes we speak of your art for its importance to your well-being. But do not forget, even though you are at Pett, that the completed works from your hand are so very good. Their aesthetic identity is wonderful, unique and self-sufficient as the best art must be - but with those fascinating undertones that thrive in your pictures. Living with your pictures is an experience of great artistic richness. I hope my enthusiasm is legible - but the train is a little bumpy.
Do not do too many tasks. I envy you your footpath walks with Tiny. Look after your hands, my treasure.

Nighttime

Stars are palaces now embassies
Bright for the changing owners.
Lovers are ambassadors who know 
The place they represent, 
Whose animal is rigid in the shield, 
Whose treaties must be signed. 

Lovers represent a world of water
Surging in every cloud,
A world of harvests sleeping in Spring, 
A world of casual charms.
Ambassadors are often far from home:
Hence, puzzles in the night.

Thorns

The water wagon follows
The serpentine effusions
Of the narrow stream
But the drug of longing steers 
Along the tangled tunnels
Of the buried veins.

Discreet and sober temples 
Of the day are paragons 
Of conduct and repose
But injected by desire
I see the world as emblems
Coming to a head.

Leaves are conches, lawns are wraps
Worn by you or part of you
Moss is a fetish
Roses are hallucinations
Sweet and purple, following
The hypodermic thorn.

Blackheath
Sunday Evening

Dearest Sylvia,
   It is half-past ten.  I wonder if you are with the Woods - or if you are in bed -  or reading.  I imagine you in these different situations and wish you were here, with me.  Had you been here today I  would have read you passages from Holman Hunt's long book about the PRB.
   As it is I shall tell you a few of the things I have learned:  Hunt's Strayed Sheep was painted on the cliffs of Fairlight in 1852.  He stayed at Cliveden Farm with Lear - Lear being there as his pupil because he wanted to work up his many drawings into paintings.  When the 2 men arranged to hire the farm Lear stipulated that they divide the house (as you do with the Woods):  later he admitted that he feared Hunt might be a lover of bull-dogs, hence the precaution of living separately.

The man in the moon or the female stars,
Moss on a leg, lace of a monolith?

The tableau vivant in the glacier
Edges into Europe carrying
The sabre-toothed tiger and murdered head.
Who do I imitate except the past.

When the alphabet of objects spells
Roses in all shadows and all lights,
In chimneys, basins, paths, and landings
Who do I imitate except desire.

Without whose ardour, could I imitate

Christened the white profile of clematis
Spindly on the rough wall of the night?

Are they mouths the hermits fed,
Does she reckon leaves as quims and mushrooms
As phallic heads of fertile buried fellows?

     Your letters are delightful and inspiring -- and with what fine drawings they are embellished. What a delicious creature [unclear]Wasily[/unclear] is, so elegant, industrious, and, when on her new garden-seat, how [unclear]wuggely[/unclear]!
     I know that your decision about Carol is not an easy one to make and I wondered if perhaps my advice to you -- against having her for Xmas -- was selfish. It is a complex situation but I am convinced that it is better, for you not to have her:  she would not really appreciate what you were doing for her & you would be rather tired.  I think the Woods have been (A) sentimental to adopt her in the 1st place & (B) irresponsible to drop her like this. But you are not placed in a way to really help Carol -- if, indeed, she can be helped. The Rectory has been for her a place to start from and not a home as such. In place of the struggle with an immature and chaotic girl you shall produce a painting, or paintings, which by this example will state your order & lovingness. Maximum expression of love & order would not have been possible in the Carol-for-Christmas (and for how long after) relation. It would have been a digression.
     Dandy has just bought a buff shirt -- plain, with long sleeves, & my usual long pointed collar. However, as always, it is too small so I shall have to return it this afternoon & get either a larger size or a different type.

Dearest dearest Sylvia,
I sent you a telegram yesterday because your letter sounded so unhappy. I wondered if the yellow envelope would worry you but in this case I thought it might remind you that you are not forgotten by me: it is only very reluctantly that I am away from you for any time at all. I want, I want so much to live with you, live with you all the time. Please do not be afraid of depending on me - I am glad that you should, for I depend on you and adore you. You say 'love me if you can': oh darling how can I do anything else. I could not stop loving you - I never have stopped. I love you. 
The Woods are behaving very foolishly and thoughtlessly at the moment but you must try and see it with detachment: Tiny's concentration on the Mountains, coming as it does with M's departure, worries you more than it otherwise would, I am certain. Despite occasional patches to the contrary the Woods love you very much, as you know really. You are not really insecure. Memories of being insecure and without a family are roused in you but in fact you have the Woods as well as me. (This is not the same as a family but friends have asked after you: you are not forgotten by Magda, Madelaine, Paul, John. They all feel warmly towards you.)
You are so precious to me that I feel with a physical real-ness your unhappiness. I need you so much and long to look tenderly after my cat, my beauty, my muse. You are everything that I want to live for, my love.
Desiree seems to be flowering, I am glad. Carol will not have such a bad time after all, it seems: the Whiloms at Henley will not be strange to her. The other female adolescent sounds less and less attractive the more I hear: I do hope that, even if she spends a fair amount of time at Pett, you may be with me much of the time at Blackheath, instead. (Perhaps you can discreetly give Desiree my kind regards, or something of that sort, for I do wish her well.)
All this fuss so that Mrs Mountain can go home and die makes me believe that (as I suspected from her name) she is an elephant. By the way, McHale wrote an image (amended a little bit by Paul) which you can tell Trumpet if you think she would like it. Lion thinks it amusing. 'Tiny elephants in a state of exhaustion leaning against petrol pumps'.
What good news about the Cricket Field: it certainly sounds to me that it is progressing well, even though you were so sad one day when at work. Do not be sad, my dearest love. I adore you and will make you laugh when we meet next, I promise.
This address in Cambridge is where I'll be one or two nights:

Dearest, my dearest Sylvia
Your sale of a picture is a great pleasure to me : it has cheered your lion no end as he has been getting over his cold, rather slowly, but, still, surely. You might perhaps (this is only a suggestion) send lion a little drawing of it, for your MSS lately have not been ( to Hetty's intense disappointment - & to mine) Ill. MSS. A drawing as well as the photograph, that is to say : am I not greedy!
Well, I shall expect you on about Monday fortnight. Time is a monster in slow-motion. (If I had found a job yet, I should be very reluctant indeed to be parted from you all this time.) On 6th November I am taking part in a Quiz or Informal Discussion in Blackheath arranged by the local Arts Society. (I fear that awful fat man will be there : if he is I shall be firm, very firm.)
No, don't return Henry VIII until you have finished with it. I have re-newed it and will do so again tomorrow. There is no hurry. 
Today I am visiting Father (who is slowly convalescing, delayed a bit by his allergy to the various drugs used to keep postoperative pains down); then tea with CS and, if I'm not tired, I shall drop in on Paul. Tomorrow (Saturday) is my day of rest and I can stay at home. Sunday I am going to Banstead (it'll be like Wednesday) to see Magda.  (By the way, there were 19 people at Banstead last Wednesday.) I have undertaken to get PAPA some detective books: anything so long as it is unreadable, unreal as a crossword puzzle, English, and up-to-date (nothing vieux like Sherlock, for example). Nothing witty, like Chandler.
I have read at last Bowen on Nostalgia and thought, as you did, that it is no great shakes: not even very well written. Still it does define one aspect of our current failure-of-nerve - as  symptom rather than as an analysis. 
The N G has at last published Davies' catalogue of The Earlier Ital. Schools: 460 pp and 8s. It is a most impressive labour indeed. Davies is a tiny (& academic) Hercules (but tiny).

Dearest Sylvia
I am just having tea before returning home. One of the things I have intended to tell you in several letters but keep forgetting is something Madeleine told me. It appears that [unclear]Uhlwan[/unclear] is sueing Raynes-Barlam & Art News for the review of his show that appeared in the last issue. Barlam (whom Richard Conroy describes as 'an elephant on skates!) doubted Uhlwan's sincerity & stated that Freddie [unclear]'eytal' [/unclear] motive from other people. I have not heard if it is to be settled out of court, for for how much. The Renaissance & 1750-1820 English galleries and the new galleries devoted to 'painted porcelain' are really superb. The [unclear]ridness[/unclear] & resource of the collection really astonishes me. You must see them when you come next in London. After I had made out my lantern slide list I had a look round. Especially memorable to me personally was a giant Chinese wallpaper from Noor Park.
I see from the newspapers this is to be a black X'mas. I am glad to hear it. White X'mas's have a double drawback. When the snow melts it is nasty underfoot  & the white market is, of course, ridiculously inadequate.

Once that was straightened out, however, the lecture went off quite well to ca 100 girls. I went for a walk in Bedford. It is really rather pretty in its haphazard, suburban manner. The hotel was not particularly pleasant & I was offered fish or Bubble & squeak for breakfast. I squeaked protestingly.

   At Cambridge I saw Thoms. He is no brighter than when I first met him & insists on all kinds of confidences (mainly financial) which I must keep to myself, he says. But since he confides in a comparative stranger I feel he is more of a menace to himself than I am. (He has more sources of income than, &c. &c.) I looked quickly in the Fitzwilliam for the figures like those in the V & A you examined on Monday but missed them somehow (I had little time).

   The lecture was to Midwives & Health Visitors. It was held in the X-Ray room, because it could easily be blacked out. Great machines, sinks, screens, rubber cables, all over the place. This too I think was quite favorably received. Instead of geranium judg-ing (or whatever that WI wanted) I was asked ad-vice on a suitable play for the midwives to visit in London.

I think my lectures were successful - to juniors and seniors (about 250-300 in all) and to the parents and adults in the evening (about 200 of them). It was interesting to act as compere to the films (I thought now what would Marsbridge have done? and reversed it).  The children were attentive and I believe some effect may have been made on some of them. Klee's ""They're Biting"" was a great success with 11-13 year olds. The teachers get interested, unfortunately, and ask questions which the children cannot follow or, sometimes criticise modern art. I can deal with this but it is a tactical mistake on the teachers' part I think- but you know teachers!

How did your lecture go? I thought of you as I chatted on about

man's bald head looked like a pot. My thoughts turned constantly to you
I'm afraid that it must have been a tiring day for you with lunch
beforehand & the long journey. I do hope you slept well after it.
Nothing is more difficult than WI lectures. I have not given
a satisfactory one yet I must admit. They are proverbially
'sticky' as audiences go.
The ICA evening was as dull to be in as it is to witness.
Herbert Read was in the audience & told me confidentially
afterwards that mine was the only serious contribution. He
also said he agreed with what I said about BH's recent
work tho' he had not written so in his book for diplomatic -
social reasons. I was awfully pleased by this as you can
imagine. i based myself on BH's statements about her
own work. Nobody else did. I seem to have born a
major part in the discussion as I alone supported BH with
some warmth. It kept coming back to me. ( Nice food, wine,
and drinks supplied by the ICA.)

I hope that your day & night with the Greenwoods was not awful. I expect you will tell me about it.
I do miss you. Do not be fearful about our ages my darling. It has not bothered us so far and we have already outstayed C's expectations. Despite my trouble getting settled financially we have been marvellously lucky & there is no reason for anxiety now. I love you - do not forget how dearly I love you.

Congratulations on the results - social, financial & cultural - of your exhibition. I should love to attend one. I know that you would handle the visitors perfectly. Incidentally what an excellent total to raise: good for Marjorie.
I enclose your V & A notes. Today of course the post offices are closed but I will send off your other things tomorrow.

Yesterday's lecture went rather well. Afterwards a man introduced himself as art editor of 'Modern Woman'. He wants me - subject to his editor's approval - to contribute a series of short articles on selected paintings at the T.G. It will pay 25 guineas or so. I shall make a draft today & tomorrow of suggested treatments & meet him for lunch in a few days to discuss details. (By the way I am working on Hilton now.)

What good news about Clifford's glass. I am so glad he has completed
the set again. What luck. His other purchases sound very impressive too.
Your new painting looks terribly nice in the sketch, as I'm sure it is.
It is not long, really, until I shall see it - in fact, as I do see it now
in imagination. The arrangement of the articles reminds me of [unclear]Evra[/unclear]

Yes I have seen Magda & John - the other evening. They were not
together with me all the time. Both asked independently after you -
were delighted you were well - & both asked about your exhibition
Their/flat and studio next to each other are behind Hanover Terrace
in Regent's Park. Charming. She is with Frank again - at least so
far as he knows.
Although my name is not in Art News so much I am fairly busy
in fact with school lectures - I had one this morning - and tomorrow
I am taking the public lecture at the N.G. on Claude.
The next ICA exhibition is of Max Ernst. I am reviewing it
for Art News. I am glad for - as you know - I enjoy Ernst very
much and this show will include some of his recent work.
Soon I should send you some poetry. I have written quite a
lot of it and once I've sorted it out you shall see it. If only I
were free of lectures I might write something interesting - except
I should be hungry.

   The view from the window is like a late Pasmore:  a few of the most elegant trees, and a pale blueish void beyond them, and, above, a gentle, orange, muggy sun.  It is a 10.30 winter morning sun.  I am sitting facing the window & a soft orange light is on the paper and the pen and my hand make a pale blue elongated shadow.
   I mentioned poems in an earlier letter.  Some of them you know already - for example MUSES which is now extensively rewritten, but here are a few bits and pieces I am working on.  First is a lyric as for a piece of dance-music (you know my perverse wish to master this style);

What do you write
In your diary at night
After we've said goodnight?

Do you say there
What I most want to hear
Or do you clinch my fear?

Am I only, someone to go dancing with
Someone to be late, never early with. . .

It is not finished yet:  perhaps it isn't worth finishing.  Then there is a poem I started at Chester:

The wall's a cat walk, town high.
Tick of the town clock rocks a head.

With foreign spurs dark on the river.

You will notice the fact the poet occupies a high place (significant in children's games & drawings) - equated with time and the sun. As light goes the office windows show up but the inhabitants are banal: no chance of their taking Phoebus' place in the sun-window. It is a megalomaniac antisocial poem.
I have been reading Empson's poems (as opposed to his prose recently) & admire it very much. He always seems (as a reviewer put it) to say less than he could - which makes a better impression than (like modern romantics) hoping to say more than you know.

Dearest Sylvia,
I have been writing roughly for 12 hours except to eat. I have completed my review of the Phillips Col. catalogue. I have rewritten & typed my (still unfinished) episodic films chapter. I have started writing the [unclear] stees [/unclear] article down from my existing notes. And I have made a synopsis of the Modern Woman series to show Tom Moore whom I plan to see this week. I have typed some poems too. And I have a mild form of writer's cramp: anyway my right arm aches. (I enclose a copy of the synopsis for you to see.)
On Thursday next CJ is taking me to Pevsner's lecture on Phases in 17c Dutch Art; then Madge is joining us for dinner - and a movie.
Would C. lend us his membership card to the Arts so that we could see Cocteau's Holy Terrors - as it is called here - next week? I think we should see it, don't you? The seats are not too expensive.
I enclose 3 poems: the last one I read you an earlier version of; the 1st one I wrote in the summer: the middle one was prompted by my walk to the post this afternoon with your letter. So that is the latest I have written.

Apart from commenting on the artist and what to look for in the individual paintings illustrated I should try and draw some general conclusion each time. For instance about portraiture apropos of the Maugham portrait or about Sunday paintings generally in connection with Greaves, and so on.

Toulouse-Lautrec: A Private Room at La Rat Mort.
Quote from 90s literature about Paris night-life. Brief biography of artist: topical at present with Moulin Rouge being filmed. Overemphasis on his deformity: great artist as well as a dwarf.

Van Gogh: Sunflowers.
Sunflowers one of series painted to welcome Paul Gauguin on visit. This visit ended in Van Gogh's first attack of madness.  The popularity of Van Gogh's art shows Victorian taste for realism is breaking down. He expresses how he feels, not only what he sees.

Renoir: La Loge.
Great interest in contemporary life in 19c. France. Renoir presents a glamourised version of it. The apparently prosperous sitters actually his brother and a model.  This painted to attract well-off sitters.  Sometimes art makes up what reality misses. Biography

Bonnard: The Window.
This artist continues Renoir's outlook on life, liking to paint the sun, flowers, pretty girls. His art is very  bold in colour and design; in character Bonnard was shy and reticent, however. Quote account on B. at work.

Dufy: Deauville.
Dufy's interest in fashionable places (including London and the Derby). Explain his distortions which produces movement (sails of yachts in wind, for example). He obtains his rich color by several methods of putting the paint on, too (discuss).

Pissarro: Boulevard des Italiens
Study of light and reflections not of solid objects themselves. Quote his letters concerning England, Paris as subject for painter, Mde. Pissarro. After life of struggle his old age spent in touring hotel bedrooms for views of the boulevards and bridges. Tie up with this picture.

Utrillo: Porte S Martin.
Paris as seen by Toulouse-Lautrec and Pissarro.  Untrillo's Paris is for tourists. His version of the city has influenced all of us in our idea of Montmartre, . Some biography.

Picasso: Femme à la Chemise.
Conditions of Picasso's life in early 20c. when he painted this work.  Melancholy women delicately painted in 'blue' period, blue in colour and in mood. (Mention artist's subsequent",0.1666666667,FALSE

The anti-clericalism is accompanied, as often in French films, by peasants treated with a combination of naturalism and caricature:  the feud of neighbours, for example, is caricatured, but brilliant acting invests the absurd figures with a sense of life - of flesh, blood, and hair.  Rene Clement's feeling for character shades into delicate insight in his handling of the children.  Paulette, unable to understand the death of her parents, mourns her dog:  'death' and prayer are words to her without the meaning & values experience attaches to them.  Michel is more knowledgeable but protects Paulette:  he learns the game from her, without her belief in it, but with loving motives which give his actions another kind of innocence.  This relationship, which is the core of the film, is touching and perceptive:  when their game touches reality (in the increasingly ambitious series of thefts to provide crosses for the animals' graves), reality is made absurd.  By comparison with their lyrical phantasies reality is official, pompous, clumsy.  Reality finally separates the children and a chilling experience of loss is communicated.  Michel destroys the animal cemetery, partly to prevent the crosses from being returned to the real cemetery, partly in an effort to efface Paulette's memory:  he places her bracelet by the owl's nest, in return for the dead mole which he took from the owl to keep Paulette's dog company.  Michel, the peasant, is enraged and destructive;  Paulette, younger,  more gentle and genteel, is stunned by the separation.

 Such slow treatment, with sluggish fades, suggests reverence, perhaps for God-in-Nature. 
 The 1st subtitle, when it finally comes is absurd - 'in the heart of the country': surprise!  The subtitles, though the obscure plot needs them, continually jar: 'Why, Countess, what are you doing alone on the ice at night?' and so on.  The reader of Conrad and the reader of the New Yorker must join in finding these sub-titles grotesque and provincial.  The images and the compositional sense of Maurice Stiller have grandeur but the nobility lurches continually into bathos.  Too many arms are raised to point at too many doors.
The opening suggests the rightness of nature.  The rhetoric of the human beings who soon appear is not devoid of insight - for example the Countess' monologue to Gosta is eloquent in every gesture, and Greta Garbo's sensual face really makes something of the symbolic flight across the lake.  However, the dragging of the plot, its perpetual detours and repetitions, does express a state of mind which soaks the film's texture.  Grandeur becomes perversity in the lingering caressing anguish which is everybody's lot sooner or later.  Large eyes look so often at the wreck of their life or hopes or on the past that a psychological malaise shadows the pantheistic landscape sense.
Perversely & expressively the ham-acting dissolves the present (the real images on the screen, that is) & sucks our attention back to [unclear]remote[/unclear], causal guilt.

How are you? I do hope that you are not anxious or
exasperated with either the Woods or Michael? I thought
of you yesterday with the Woods returning. I hope that
M and they get on smoothly together. Let me have all the
news. Is M making a good Christ? I am sure it is just
the role for him, in his recent mood of suffering. And
Rye? Have you get there yet?

I have finished Angus Wilson and I must say I adored it.
I don't agree with the Woods that the end compromises but
I don't think it a very good ending either. I feel that
he had to wind things up somehow and though some of the
last two chapters was good I felt it less vivid than the 
rest of the book. But, as I say, I loved it.

The rehearsal of Frank Cordell's Mr. Music programme was
very interesting, as he corrected the orchestra, as the
announcer fitted his words in, as the microphones had to
be shifted to get a proper balance, and so on. After 3
hours of this I heard the programme in a listening room
near the studio in Aeolian Hall. Also I met some of the
people I was supposed to meet in connection with future
BBC work. I am going to finish The Travel Agent by next
Sunday, give it to Frank, and he is taking it with him to
Jugoslavia (where they are all going on holiday for a month)
to write the music. It should be all ready by September.

I am getting my lectures ready, rather slowly but I am
quite pleased with all the new material on unfamiliar artists I am gathering.

 I have written a poem called Lessons which I enclose. On
the basis of a few science-fiction cliches I have tried to
define, in the thinnest, remote, and colloquial terms Spengler's idea of Faustian Man: you remember, forces rather
bodies, function instead of being. We read it in the
Social Philosophies of an Age of Crisis book while you
painted your Conway Hills. (How I like that picture, by
the way. I think it is a good idea to put it in Rye.)

My father's holiday began, without my realising it, and he
and mother are having a few days at Worthing. They will
be back in a day or so, and I shall give mother your picture then. I can have it here for a day or two longer

I am afraid that I can't post this letter today as I have no stamps. You will not receive this until tuesday, I regret. Still, I expect you are busy with your guests.
Thank you for the cuttings all of which I have read with various degrees of irritation and fury. The Confidential Clerk sounds, as you all but said, crap: as for the art critic's view of Elizabethan portraiture... How reliable can we assume the political part of the paper to be, really, when the arts side is never right? But, never.
Yesterday's Van Gogh lecture was like Saturday at the N.G. Crowds. I think it went well. I argued that he painted as he did against his illness, not because of it. His paintings, like a psychotic's symptoms, are an effort to control his disease. So it is false to say his art reflects his disease, passively.
Father came to the lecture and afterwards we went to LILI which we both enjoyed very much. It is sentimental and sweet and rather literary. But I found it worked in all the ways Hans Christian Andersen failed to: an idea of innocence is established by Leslie Caron.
Today I have not gone to Harpenden and Luton Hoo. Instead I am doing some writing. It is nice to be working on something instead of a lecture again. Pasmore approved the synopsis of the Arch. Rev. article and today I have written and typed a thousand words of it: that is just about one/third.
Author Lion is sitting about in his pyjamas. He has not dressed all day. I have a new pair of shoes (my parent's birthday present): brown casuals. They look something like this - (or, rather, one of them does).

I wish you were here. Apart from all the other reasons a nice painting could be made of the scaffolding outside the window. I got out on it the other day an adored seeing our room from a few feet outside the windows. No interpretations - please!

staying the night at Wimbledon as Surbiton is in that

I enjoyed my Turner lecture on his English pictures. I argued that the Simple Nature period (Frosty Morning & all
that) was no more 'realistic' than views of Venice &
castles on the Rhine. I found various expressive motives
to support my ideas - and, anyway, I said, the whole
of Turner's work is 'abstracted' from nature, so it is wrong
to praise one period for realism only, as is customary.

Last night Mrs Harrison & Mrs Williams had a great

is tired of the workmen in the place & did not want to

John is going to see if he has any suitable jewellery. If he has I will let you know all details. He is making constructions that are very interesting and which I believe you will like. Magda and John join me in awaiting you impatiently.

Frank and I have not found a good idea for the radio series yet but he hit on an idea for a children's two-sided record for Christmas. I wrote it over the weekend. It is ""Willie and the Magic Tune.""  The chief of H.M.V. is considering it already and I shall know his verdict on Wednesday, probably.

Magda took us all to see SHANE. It is wonderful. I hope that I shall be able to persuade you to see it. It is a Western told with the technique (or some of it) of Eisenstein and Pudovkin. With all this Russian influence the director must be running a risk. Monumental, humane, violet, and full of mythology: waste land and saviour stuff, but so well related to the realistic narrative!  C.V. Wedgewood called it 'a boy's film': have I news for C.V. Wedgewood!

Though I am not modifying my opinion of Ustinov as a playwright I have to admit (having heard ""In All Directions"") that he is a brilliant radio comedian- as scriptwriter and player.  (It is on Monday evening at 9.30.)

My next lecture is on Mathew Smith. I wish I liked him more; or, I wish he were less good than he is. I don't know what I am going to say. Come 5.00  o'clock I shall think of something, I suppose.

Dearest Sylvia:

Looking back at one of your letters I considered the pictures you
suggest for London Exhibitions. I think the ones you suggest are
most suitable: Dressing Table and View from Attic for the London
group sounds alright to me. Your idea of taking them to Kensington on 24th is a good idea, too, if you don't find it too tiring.

Here are two poems which are about my attitude to poetry. The
poets referred to in the first one are Stevens (who tends to be a
bit Olympian and elderly) and Cummings who is just too boyish at
times:

The loaves of autumn are baked for Stevens.
The elderly avenues take auroras.
He's lucky, but poor us,
less adjusted to 'the painter's season.*

Though short of Fall we're not so young as
the boyish printemps merchant of sixty
Who's again fixity.
His name if you spring him is Cummings.

Where shall we drop from Cummings' trapeze
if it isn't into the lap of autumn,
from high bar to the down
where wounded forests collapse at a sneeze

Midair were perfect, if we could wait
between the most of gravity and flight.

POET AT HOME

The world is some poets' table

The film show was the end, so bad! Full of the crudest techniques
and most vulgar opinions. Frank, John, and I ought to be
able to dominate the entire field. Frank & I have thought of another subject: Victorian LONDON STATUES, part grave, but
really satirical. Perhaps with some distortions of the statues.
Kenneth Martin's show at the hospital at Highgate was stunning. He is even better than I thought. The way the mobiles
humanize the space of the children's ward is impressive and
exhilarating. Magda & John came & were very appreciative
also.
M was very agreeable on Saturday and his show was good,

exhibition of modern British sculpture. Almost everything
on show is really recent: the only notable artist not repre-
sented by current work is Turnbull, whose bronzes are 1951.
Until recently many of the younger sculptors used biolog-
ical forms lower than the human: this is supposed to express
a feeling for life as something basic and pervasive.
There is a tendency now
away from late surrealist biomorphism towards more direct versions of the human image. Though a drawing of 1952 reminds
us of Reg Butler's mastery of the B.E.M.*, he shows a Girl in
shell bronze of this year which confirms the impression of
the 'watchers' in the Prisoner maquette, that the human contour
is appearing.
Armitage is showing two single figures, both this year's.
The best of them, I think, is no. 2. It is part-totem, part
playing-card: nose, breasts, navel, hands push out from both sides of the flat-
tish bronze plate. The nicety with which he
retains evocative human fragments has an Italiante mannerist
sensuality about it: he never loses the buttocks' curves or
dimples.

As I told you Dannatt is surveying the house Monday, 9.30.
I had a letter from him this morning saying that 'in view
of the fact that the house has been empty for a year we feel
that the question of drainage should be investigated' and,
therefore, one of the staff is going 'to inspect the Council's
drainage plan and compare this with what he finds on the

I have just read your letters & [unclear]South's[/unclear] most carefully. I notice that he says you could not expect more than 1500 from the Trustees (probably less). That means Georgie's 1000 (almost all of it) would go on the purchase of 46. Therefore we would not have enough for immediate repairs (estimated at 600-700). I have worked out more sums, and I am not hopeful unless the owner will accept 2000 for the house. I will make that offer today: it must be our top price. If Foster & Foster are interested in that I will ask their advice about a builder's free estimate - but not until then.
I hate the thought of not getting the house, and we still may. But it is a house - only one house among hundreds - not a symbol - so I am reconciling myself to the possibility of finding somewhere else if need be. You should, too, I think. Victor [unclear]Pasmore[/unclear] suggests we look in Greenwich: tho' parts of it are nasty, the nice parts are excellent. He points out it is cheaper than Blackheath. That is a lead, I think. The Lewisham side of the Heath is another possibility.

them this morning. Why have me go in if South was going to do
it? I cannot help the deal if I do not know what you are
doing. I was immediately at a disadvantage when I tried to
discuss a lower price than 2400 because I had no way of knowing what South (and you?) had said. So the whole meeting was
inconclusive. I suppose you will hear the next news from
South. I don't see what I can do now.

I appreciate the need for speed, of course, and I will do all I
can: so let me know the next move. I am afraid I have achieved
nothing this morning.

Still I am very busy: a lecture every day and I
am writing about Pasmore and about Paolozzi. Two weeks and I

I slept until 11.30, unfortunately because I must get my Klee contribution ready, fortunately because I was so tired.  The Pedagogical Sketchbook is really rather a difficult subject, I am finding.

It was wonderful seeing you. I agree with you that our difficulties come from not seeing enough of each other.  I miss you so much.  Soon this obstacle will be removed - if not at one house, then at another. I can not wait for this, my love.

Altho' the Richmond house is attractive it is out of town. I do think we should have [unclear]Dauvatt's[/unclear] report on the Chepstow Road house before trying for the Richmond one. Low fares, not having to have meals in town, being central, able to go about together: all these add up to a strong case for London W2, I think.  You mentioned the fare to South Kensington: it would very soon add up, my love.  It isn't forever: neither of us wants to live in London forever. We can always sell it and move at a later date.

preliminary period. The year after Klee's book appeared Kan-
dinski published Point and Line to Plane based on his own course,
and covering some of the same ground as the Sketchbook. Kan-
dinski's book (as you might expect) is much longer than Klee's
and has a rigidity and comprehensiveness in its examination of
formal elements which is academic compared to Klee. Though
Klee looked for and found 'a formula covering all circulating
forces at once' (5) his handling of it is highly flexible.
Kandinski tries to give sensory expression to universals, like
a cinquecento mannerist reasoning to explain invisible beauty,
whereas Klee's art is rooted in specific events and feelings.
Klee used to draw for his classes with both hands at once:
Kandinski could almost say of his  Circles period (1925-7) -
'look, no hands'. As Leo Stein wrote: 'in every sketch of
Klee's the symbol is fashioned anew. If this is mysticism it
is certainly not of the medieval contemplative kind. It is a
restless existential mysticism' (6).
 The preliminary course was divided into 3 categories: obser-
vation, representation, and design. Observation meant the study
of materials and the study of nature. and
here Klee was qualified indeed, as Stein shows. Representation
was the study of geometry and draftsmanship, along with
model-making and construction. Design was the study of volume,
color, and composition. As we shall see, Klee failed to deal
with the category of design in a satisfactory way.

are transmissible.
There are two kinds of statements about art that artists make.
There are close personal statements whose referents lie away
in the artist's work. There are also pedagogic statements
(occasionally successful) in which the personal experience of
the artist connects with impersonal matters. Some people regard the Sketchbook as a document permitting insight into Klee's
art. Up to a point it does that, of coarse, but I have already
mentioned important personal omissions. I might add, too, that
the art of Klee's last period in the 1930s , is not contained by
his statements. The Sketchbook is not a paraphrase of Klee's
art, it is the outline of a method. The crucial point is to decide whether or not what Klee wrote in 1925 is still relevant.
The Sketchbook is at the heart of 20c. ideas of space-time and I
see no real evidence that motion-studies are being replaced by
another art-form. That is to as an art-critic. From the
point of view of art-education, I think that Klee's methods may
still be potent, also: to replace the incoherent mixture of intuitives and academics in British art schools by Klee's compound
of precision and adventurousness would be a public service.

Still, tho' the social part was dull the food was great & the drinks plentiful. Mandy is terribly remote & distant but we did what we could for her - I fixed games so she won, and so on.

     My muse, I love you so much, I adore you, while you are away, 
in imagination, with thoughts based on the future and the past
which makes the present bearable or, rather illuminate the
dull summer with your dazzling presence. My pen has been
rather inhibited in the past few letters but my love for you and
desire for you to be here is unchanged. Undoubtedly my love
wars with resentment or melancholy but this letter will show the frequent outcome of such conflicts.
     I wish I had a loving poem to send you, not the rather detached ones I've been sending you which are both cerebral & slight:
I am working on a poem which is not yet complete [unclear]and/but[/unclear] I shall send 
it soon as a document of desire, a lecture on love.
     My loving and involuntary memories of you are both delightful, in their grace and beauty, and unsatisfactory because I desire
you here so much. But it is your beauty, as I say, not my complaints that is in my mind today. Not your beauty in terms of time -
anticipation of retrospection - but simply as a wealth of exquisite 
and magical imagery, or brilliant collection of jewels all of 
which represent aspects of your appearance and identity.
     Each image is informed with a wealth of associations so the
total idea of you has space as well as colour. The jewels are you
as my lover, ravishing and bright, while, in the associations at -
[unclear](two words)[/unclear] each jewel you are, in your absence, a muse. When you
are with me the two aspects of muse and lover are reconciled -
then it is the jewel-images that fill both functions. Hence the distractions in some of my latest poems which I hope to exclude with
an effort of will.
     The schizophrenic difficulties are greater in your case and there -
fore my love I must stop talking about you-in-me and hope that
you are able to be happy without minimizing my love. At least be
assured of my love, my desire, and altogether extravagant adoration of you. Tell me you love me, my dearest love, as I love you.",0.1666666667,FALSE

I should like but I am in a post office and have a

Dearest Sylvia,

The Leger exhibition is very interesting and I long to go with you shortly. I showed it to my class and also all the impressionists and post-impressionists, too. They were all exhausted. Then I left them and had my last visit to the French landscapes, making some notes. I tried to order a photograph of the River Gods but none is available, alas.

Douglas Cooper was at the Tate, making notes, (no less than 30 items were lent by him) and seemed very interested in me, following me out of the Leger show into the post-impressionists at one point... He is even fatter than he looked up on the platform at Burlington House.

Today, later on, Molly and Eric are coming, bringing Charles Perry: this is rather a bore but it is necessary as he has long wanted to come and I could think of no ruse to postpone it any longer.

I have the Sunday Times delivered again: having read it this morning I have the old impulse to stop it again. Desmond McCarthy on Sartre and psychoanalysis... He refers to - and I quote - 'anal and other complexes'.

The weather has been charming: buds appearing everywhere, Blackheath Park is becoming prettier daily.

I have at last written a poem: BAROQUE SONG

Once in a landscape overgrown with ferns
And shadows of the crumbling viaducts
Cimon discovered by a bronze fountain
A sleeping girl -
A tiny animal quivering in her breasts.

She dreamed of what girls dream of when the sun
Is warm upon their legs and water splashes
From mouths of the high dolphins in the basin
And woke to see
The gawking monster lurching on his staff.

Converted to a castiglione
By her panic, Cimon the rustic character
Who wore a bird's-nest for a cod-piece
Woke to Iphigenia
Rose to her beauty like the unmewed falcon.",0.1666666667,FALSE

Dearest Sylvia,

Here are the two books and the pen.  I hope they arrive safely in my parcel...

Yesterday I got four 18th century collections of 
plays from the bookshop in Blackheath.  I had no money so, since the man was friendly, I have put them on my account!  Opened yesterday of course.  They are madly cheap.  2s. 6d. each.  In one is Dryden's Cedip-
ius, and a play about Charles I which I got especially
to read to you.  In another there is a play by Hogarth's friend Dr Hoadly which I read last night: it is admirable.

Today I am going to see Molly so in my next letter I
will tell you if they are interested in the sideboard.

Tomorrow afternoon I have an appointment with Penguin books.  I shall tell them my ideas though I doubt any-
thing concrete will transpire immediately.

I have been looking at your paintings again - with
what pleasure I need not tell you.  I was passing your Venus when I simply had to stop and examine the delicious, sensuous, felicitous brush-work.  It is divine.

By the way, I forgot to tell you in my last letter.
John says that next year there are several lectures in a coast town in Yorkshire.  I've told him we are interested.  We ought to be able to move further North
to the Giorgione's and the other things we want to see.  
A large percentage of the fares would be paid.

I love you, my darling, love and adore you.

your letter. I do know Waller's poem and get much delight
from it.   I adore your description of the rose bush, so
accurate and so loving, two qualities which, as you know,
I admire together.  There is a poem by Yeats, too long to
quote, about a fine lady who loves a poet.  But she loves
her virtue too and so, when it is dark, sends her maid to
the poet:  he loves her as her Mistress and never knows
better as she leaves before dawn.  His poems now today are famous.
They die and are buried together.  The maid survives for a time
and then dying confesses to the priest of the deception.
He buries her with the Poet and the Lady and three rose
bushes over each grave grow together.

     Thank you for the kind and understanding things you say
about the owl poem, my Sylvia.

    Alas, even if Michael agrees, I don't believe I can man-
age to come on Thursday because I have two appointments on
that day and, but this is the point, Mother says she won't
have my things ready before Friday because there is a fete
which she is attending for three days next week.

     I know Les Mouches and agree that there is a triumphal 
note in it but that is just what I do not like and, really,
I'm surprised you do.  The triumph is that of becoming com-
mitted to the people of Argos, the masses.  Orestes is 'too
light':  that is he is not putting his liberty into effect.
He uses his liberty to kill his parents and, excellently,
does not feel remorse, and this is an example to the guilt
ridden population of the city.  This is alright but in my 
opinion the price he pays is too great:  he puts his liberty
at the service of the people which seems to be Bad Faith.
The sceptical hedonism of the tutor fails to influence Ores-
tes who is evangelical in a way.  But I greatly admire the
Orestes-Zeus dialogues.  The piece is very much on the side
of the common man as, oddly, a part of Sartre is.  The in-
fluence of the occupation by the Germans, as in the poetry
of Eluard and Aragon is banal in its results.  Only Cocteau
preserves his 'liberty' as in The Eagle Has Two Heads.

Here is a quatrain for Sylvia:

     The morning I see her as a bird
      Noon and a flag welcomes the sun
     Evening the trees are tranquil hives of feathers
     Morning anticipated this repose 

I love you so very much.  This letter has been rather anec-
dotal and realistic.  Never mind:  I can't change it now.
But I must say again - I love you.

Dearest Sylvia,

John Skipp suggests that I go down to Blackheath in the New Year and meet the people who are in the flat at the moment. Since the landlady asked him if he knew anybody it seems fairly certain we shall get it without any difficult. My impression is that the present occupants, though moving shortly, are not moving immediately. What I shall do, if you agree, is take a place temporarily and we can move to Blackheath a week or two later. I do not want us to delay. I could not bear to. I will take a place directly after Christmas, if you agree, and please do, dearest.

I adore your painting. The synthesis of the different rhythms of growth is wonderful. The summer-snow of the blossom, the exquisite tone of the upper trunks on the blue sky, is so delicate and yet impetuous too. And the painting of the irregular climbing trunks is superb. When you exhibit we must certainly put it in - though with a red star on it from the opening day! It is a splendid picture.

Our love has opened like a rose.
The future is a bud, breathe on it, breathe,
To see it open like our love -
Responding to our warm cupped hands.

Our hands, our living breath, compel the flower
And after it the fruit, our sustenance.
We trust the future and it answers us
As the bare tree answers the new wind.

There was a time when we had not this love
And the past seemed likely to last forever
In endless rooms of fear:

We have it now, the gift of love,
Sanctioned by time, who offers next
A future dedicated to our love.

Many thanks for your letter it makes me happy again. Pablo and the Owls are glad it has come. 'Really you've been quite unbearable these last few days' commented Pablo as I benevolently shared my cereals with him. I have not time at the moment to answer it fully but I shall write again tonight or tomorrow and tell you the things you ask. Your words of love make me so happy. Oh Sylvia I love you.

Thank you for your letter which came this morning with one from the Pooles telling me that they are leaving on the morning of April 5th. I think that is Tuesday. I shall leave here, I suppose, on the 4th, go to Banstead, stay the night at Wimbledon, and go in on 5th.

And gamins run for cover in each leaf.

Saturday night I missed the last train so Paul and I had to stay the night in London. I met a medley of Paul's friends - he seems to be sure of meeting people after midnight - all homosexual and most of them amusing. The news of the world was on sale outside Lyons' Corner House at 2 o'clock. I bought the Observer at 4 o'clock and was pleased to find my review of Mary Woodall in already The printer's ink was just dry. 

So your lion spent quite a lot of Sunday sleeping but in the afternoon and evening he read Worringer's important book, Form In Gothic right through, making notes on it. I feel perfectly well today - no headache, no  hangover and I intend to work all after - ",0.1428571429,FALSE

Do you remember one of the very first poems I wrote for you: 'Goodbye the mists above Fairlight' and, then,

Our history is forgotten 
But you Minerva recoup 
Those Southern voyages 
Which I may also follow 

They seem appropriate again. Then I remembered a more recent sonnet:

The future is a vase that we shall turn 
To find our flowers and dances going on

And the following sonnet is the result of recalling these in the light of the present situation:

The future is a trip to Italy:
Do not return, my traveller, to the past,
Glacial, unconfident, but rest 
In the creative Southern country.

From there embark with me for Cythera
Where vines grow over painters easel 
(As on the ship which came at last to Naxos)
And birds escort the lovely traveller

The shell whispers on the English sand:
-Master the culture of the sun, accept
The blood-red rings he puts upon your hand,
The triumph of your beauty he expects.

Welcome the journey and the sun's great dance 
Inhibited no more by past allegiance.

And the line in brackets refers to that lovely story of Bacchus in Bullfinch.

I wonder what poetry Italy will produce. I see Florence as a sestina with architectural terms repeated at the line ends. I will write it in the afternoons while you paint.

Float on rootless legs not stand
In a world that yields to sunlight.
Reclining, reading, sitting
We are suspended in a blaze of light
That melts the solid steps and path
Until we float among the named flowers.

The sun is warm upon me as I type and though there
is a wind I hope you will be able to work upon your 
picture.  Last night I went for a walk on the heath 
and there was an amazingly strong wind with a melo-
dramatic sky, very sublime with lashing trees and the 
large sinister Victorian houses.

Paul Southey came and renewed his admiration for
Ajax and the Poet.  He read some of my new poems and
was, again, very pleasing about them - admiring them
and analyzing them sympathetically.  I have nearly
finished Polydore, or The Poet's Century and am working on one called Conversation Between Two Figures in 
the Temptation of a Saint.

You ask about my lectures:  the Flemish one was a bit dull but I don't suppose it showed to the audience. 
I am going to prepare my Veronese lecture this morning.
I miss you from the audience very strongly, my learned
beauty, erudite cat.

I am glad to hear the cat is going successfully for-
ward in the little Savage portrait, though not surprised.

I suppose you are about 1/2 way through your lecture. I have just returned from a glass of grapefruit- ade - not bad - I was so thirsty.

I have read 25 pages of ""the Heat of the Day"" I find it very wordy so far - it describes things at great length. Perhaps it improves later.

Dearest Sylvia,

Thank you so much for your letter this morning. I know how anxious one does become: I am sad to think how unhappy you must have been. I do trust that you are better now. Perhaps the fact that you have successfully roused me in the matter of a job, and the fact that you are now painting again, will ease your mind. It should do, my darling, my love, my beauty, my own. I am so sorry for my part in disturbing you: forgive me. As you say, I like telegrams - but I was very disturbed to have such a serious one. I am sorry not to have phoned you that evening when you were alone: I wish I had been here so that I could have.

Clifford's books for review sound very interesting. I do hope there are not too many of them. I expect there are. I am looking forward to his lecture very much. By the way, perhaps I should tell you my commitments for next week. They are as follows: Tuesday, T.G. at 3.00; Wednesday, Banstead (first lecture) at 7:30; Thursday, T.G. at 3.00. The second Birmingham lecture is not until the following week. How I look forward to Monday: I will meet you when and where you say, of course. It will be terribly nice to see Clifford again too...

I enclose a portrait of Dandylion that Hetty has just made. She is a little worried about it travelling by post as she fears for the fine detail (I think she means the whiskers) but Dandy says you ought to have it now, right away. So, I hope it has travelled alright...

Iris wants me to send her some film and art articles: there is just a chance Britania and Eve might use something. It seems the editor feels a change is due, asked the staff for suggestions, and Iris thought of me. The editor may think me too fancy (as there isn't time to write something specially) but it is worth trying.

When we meet I must warn you Dandy will probably start, even while staggering under the weight of your bags, all your bags, talking about Belgian painters. Not because he knows so much, but because he is now able to pronounce them. I think, from the sound of one or two names, some of the painters must be owls. I am not mistaken I think?

Darling, do not worry. I hope Tiny is back. I love you and never cease thinking of you. I love you so much,  you are my whole life,

Dearest Sylvia,

I wish you were here. In lieu of that pleasure,
however, I hope that your journey back was bearable
and that Pett is not hostile or worrying to you.
Do remember that you should paint, if possible.

I wonder what you are doing today. Look after
your hands, my beauty. Perhaps I should have sent
Hetty with you, after all, to see to your hands.
I hope you are having terribly long talks with
Tiny in the kitchen: that always sounds most fun.

Today I am meeting Ithell at the Hanover and,
apparently, in the evening she is taking me to something-or-other, I don't know what, at the I.C.A.

Tell C. I hope to have his books for him in a
day or so: and if he can remember the name of the
couple who erotically corresponded I should be glad.

Charles has invited me to a party at Roland, Browse,
&c. but unhappily I have to be at Banstead. Still,
as Hetty says, probably there would not have been
any dancing... and that is all Dandy wants nowadays.

Do not worry about exhibitions. I have them all
clear in my tete. Let me know what you arrange about
the Poet in the Garden: I will gladly meet a bus
with it on if you are not coming up yet. I wonder
if you have heard yet from the R.I. and New English.

Rain increased as the train went North. As the last light failed precisely we reached Lincoln. I crossed a footbridge - high in the wet dark - making out a romantic railway station and, beyond a car park, the Grand Hotel where I am staying. It is a Georgian-looking building but so extended & added to all sense of order has disappeared. The waiter, at dinner, asked if it was still raining: so remote is the dining room from the open air he could not tell. However intricate and diffuse the Hotel may be, the bed is soft, the water is hot, and dinner was excellent (grilled steak & mushrooms). I believe I shall be comfortable here.

I saw the films last night: one, Images Medievale, is very good - a technicolour microcosm of med. life and belief drawn from Ill Mss in the Bibliotheque Nationale . Colour is excellent. Van Gogh is a vulgar attempt to convey his state of mind thru bits of his pictures. Matisse, as you know, is excellent. Botticelli is simple and not unpleasant. La Poulette Grise is itself a work of art and, not a film about art: at least it sets out to be - transformations of hen and egg in all kinds of background - theme and variations.
Well it is nearly 8.00: I must write out a few notes and then go down to breakfast. I will continue this whenever I get an opportunity, my love.

Your new poem sounds delightful - what about the film book?
I love you my dearest, but begin to wish I loved you less, for as, you brought my work to life and gave me the heart and confidence to paint so now I fear it will be the only thing left to me, and if it will be enough.

Thank you for your letters. Let me know what train you are
coming on and I will meet you. I mention this now as there may
not be time to confirm it - but I will meet whatever train
you name.
I am so glad that you enjoyed the coronation and drank the
Queen's health. (The Imbers do sound a tense family. I am glad
that there's less conflict in Frances' family.) You will be
able to see the Coronation on 3-D, wide screen, technicolor
films, if you want to, when you come to town.
Pasmore, the other day, was charming. He chattered about so
many things beside abstract art! I have never known him get
off shop before. It was very pleasant.
John and Magda came 1st yesterday: Frank came after tea (he
had been at a recording session). Everybody admired again
Ajax. Magda adored Hetty: John does, too - he had told Magda
all about it. I borrowed the money from mother and so
entertained them quite lavishly. I read them the treatment
of my sound play which they like so all that remains is to
write it. Probable title: The TRAVEL AGENT.
The songs I have written already
won't do. I have to scrap my

Angus Wilson wrote very conventionally about [unclear]Monkwood[/unclear] in
The Observer and The Listener was bad, too. I hope he gets
fairer reviews than these - tho' I expect it's just what C expected.

Monday

My dearest Sylvia,

You can, of course, disregard my last letter about the Sec. Soc. for C. has now sent me a letter, which came this morning, and I see that the lecture and the article are off. I note with regret that the Journal must end - how very disappointing.
I enclose, but do not show C., of course, a caricature of the kind of notice [unclear]Haine[/unclear] was given in The Londoner's Diary. In fact the sentences in quotes are taken from the Standard and the News Chronicle obituary - gossip rates.  However, Molly tell me The Times gave him a decent notice.
Also enclosed is the giants poem. I hope you like it. I hope you will not frown on the note of something approaching, well, 'social conscience' at the end.
How are you feeling now? I was concerned to read of your bad nights and, also, of your cold. I do certainly hope this is not too bad. Has it gone? At least - it is going?
For myself, my glands are still up but they do not cause any discomfort. I shall lecture as usual tomorrow but I plan not to move about lectures town and home more than the absolute minimum.
What are you painting I wonder? Perhaps Armida, perhaps some pansies, for if you have had the kind of weather we have had, you will not have had much opportunity to paint out. You would really be 'braving the elements', as I expect George (your mother-in-law) wld. say. Our weekend with Chase will be so nice - a chance to go through all your work again. Marvellous. I can barely wait: nor can I wait to see you. Oh how impatient I am to see you, to be with you, again, my love, my love.
Lion is disappointed about the lecture but the work I have done will be very useful to me. Groddeck, by the way, was much less interesting than I thought when I cam to read him closely. Terribly irrational and intuitive, I'm afraid, tho' he would say - just the sterile objections to be expected in the 20s!
My poem about birthdays comes very slowly as there is an intricate rhyming scheme, but you shall see it soon. I expect it will be about 60 lines.

I love you dearly

Dearest Sylvia,

I am delighted with the news of your lecture con-
tained in today's letter. Congratulations, my dear
Minerva. Your audience seems to be admirable. You
seem to have enjoyed it very much: that is a good
thing - I knew that your nervousness would vanish with
a little practice. How I look forward to hearing one
for myself. How kind of you to arrange the syllabus
with an eye on a lion. Clifford and Marjorie and I
talked about you and in the afternoon Marjorie told
me what you would be doing at exactly what time: 'now,
at four, she will be going to the bus', and so on. I
thought about you very hard and lovingly.

I enjoyed yesterday very much indeed. We went
to the Kensington Gallery first and we enjoyed both
your pictures and the pleasant context in which they
are to be seen. How very good they are! Then we
went to the Arcade Gallery and again you can imagine
the thoughts of you that were in my mind as we looked
at the 'fantastic and bizarre' pictures. One of the
pieces, Juno and Minerva surrounded by Symbols by Rottenhammer suggested a poem I have just written, with
the substitution of Apollo for Juno. I liked very
much the Genoese triptych.

The sex talk was admirable: nothing new I think
to Clifford but the survey of the pronouncements on
sex by early Christians interested me greatly in its
disgusting manner. The lecturer's opinions about sex and rationalism were irreproachable and he thoroughly denounced
every aspect of religious influence on our society.

I will not say  you have been lucky but rather that you have been tough, persistent, so that there is nothing unexpected about your new work.  You have prepared it. And how I enjoyed your earlier work! Your portrait of Clifford and Tiny sticks in my mind (the double one) and Clifford's head. And your nude self-portrait remains very vivid indeed to me: I reflect that you understand yourself as well as other people. How interesting it will be to compare it with your new self portrait against the light. But now that I have started I could go on for many more lines than a letter really permits about your paintings. For example the fresh self-portrait with charming greens and a gusty nervous vigour in it and the wonderfully strong rhythms, on such large scale, of those three flowers drawings - heroic tulips.

My dearest Sylvia,
Sequel to my slight anthology of rose
images is this one, devoted to Owls. As
I shall be in Pett soon I thought it wise
to flatter them a little.

And dew is cold upon the ground
And the far-off stream is dumb,
And the whirring sail goes round,
And the whirring sail goes round:
Alone and warming his fine wits,

in this next one for the whole poem to come

And sang to a small guitar...

Speaks the unbeliever's fright.

My dearest Sylvia:
You occupy the foreground of my mind: a feeling of hopeless tenderness consumes me. It is difficult to concentrate on reading, on writing, even to you, because it detracts from my concentration on your image, which is especially strong just now.
Your didactic remarks yesterday are producing immediate changes in my behaviour patterns. I went for a two-hour bike-ride this late afternoon (to Hampton Court and discovered a delicious bit of Victorian Gothic in a villa on the way) and have resolved to go to bed early tonight and tomorrow as I am in both evenings. In return you will read the Waste Land for me, won't you?
I saw Molly and told her not to tell Iris anything about us and gave her evidence of Iris' double-dealing. So there is nothing to worry about there. I saw Evelyn McHale, also, and it is alright about Wednesday. So, now, all I have to do is hope my auto-suggestion worked as well as did that of Disney's little mouse in Dumbo. He jumps up on the pillow and whispers into an enormous ear that Dumbo must be given a chance in the circus. (The ear was the ringmaster's).
This is one of the poems I read you a little time ago:
The still life on the table
Holds skull and book
But the lamp is hidden by the owl's wing
There is only you

That nest of flesh your mouth
And the soft star
Which gives and needs no light
There is nothing else.

Tonight I am thinking about Michael's prediction about our affaire. Although all the material opportunity and comfort and so on is on his side I do not believe he is right. You mean so very much to me. I see I am falling into the cliches of the love-letter and apologise for it but I must repeat it because it says what I mean in the only way possible outside a poem. I love you.

  I am delighted to hear you're painting and it sounds a nice
subject. And I'm glad too that Michael is working, as you put
it 'at great speed' - I'm sure that is a good thing for him.
   Do you know any good poets in fiction; any nice plausible 
ones, that is- or even plausibly romantic ones? I have tried
to think of some but cannot. Would Michael know of any? It
is only a train of though at present but I might follow it up
one day with amusing results possibly in an essay.
  The repetitions of the birthday poem were intended to sug-
gest that there is no element of loss in your birthday- no loss
to time that is. Three goodbye stanzas and three hello ones;
the same images repeated  with differences to suggest the continuing structure.
 I'm afraid at present there's no definite news about Mother 
as Patron. Father is worried about money and cannot pay out
four pounds odd for a picture though he has just had a heating
thing installed at about a hundred pounds. Mother however is
interested and something may come of it.
  Paul and I discovered a shop in Brixton the other day called
'Black and Jutting' and a friend of Molly's has a friend who knows
two ladies named Miss Cockshut and Lady Hayter. Really. What
would Flugel say about the professional tie-up of the former pair?

   Mirrored forever in the fatal shield.

that only for the purposes of this poem does the poet equate

A NARRATIVE OF OWLS

A black owl flew
From the sea most blue
To London Town
Where he settled down
in saint James' park
Just before it stopped being dark

A white owl who
Had crossed the sea too
Got there earlier
And was fast asleep
His feathers were curlier
But he wasn't so deep

Another white owl
Played about on the way
And when it was day
Had to hide in the cowl
Of a monk named Dunch
Who ate him for lunch

A blue owl made
The trip by cloud
And was dismayed
To find so little luggage allowed
That he could not bring
A change of wing

A grey owl went to see
The National Gallery
But fell in love with a lion
And wouldn't fly on
He's still there only
He's getting lonely

But one night soon
By the light of the moon
These owls will set
A course for Pett
For East or West
The nest
Is best
And its nearly Soon.

Dearest Sylvia:

I hope your journey was a pleasant one; as pleasant as possible in the 'bus, tired as you were.  I hope, too, you had a good night's rest.  What a pity today that we can't sunbathe and be united in Phoebus' rays.  I'm sure some sun is just what architecture students require, after examinations.  Rain drips here in two tempos"" quick and lively and continual on the leaves in the front garden, heavy and grave in the drops from the eaves.

Poetry has not welcomed me back yet.  You are still tired, my Muse told me, come back when you've had a good rest.  I shall do so, and, for the present, prose must suffice.

In a little while I am going to go to Putney and see La Belle et la Bete and I shall think of you all the time.

Last evening I tried to get the two poems you told me about but I was unsuccessful but I shall not forget and will find them soon you can be sure.

Have you read MacCarthy in the Sunday Times today?  The 17th century, he ventures, whatever you say, 'was the flowering-time of Religion in English poetry.'  'It was', he goes on to say, 'the age of Donne, Herbert, Crawshaw, Vaughan, Milton'.  While we have critics with MacCarthy's original gifts we shan't harm, shall we???

I am so happy because you love me, so happy despite all the material obstacles.  I love you, Sylvia.  Perhaps this declaration is lacking in subtlety and elegance but with a typewriter you can't very well change what you put down and in any case I want to leave it just as it is.  I Love You.

I have to stop because tea is clattering nearer but I shall write again shortly, dearest.

My dearest Sylvia:

How strange and how delightful that our letters,
both written on the 25th at 11 o'clock, should pass
in the post.  I am so glad that you are happy apart from and because of me, as you say only in better
English in your letter, and in very large measure
I agree with you.  I shall try and put this paradox into verse.  I think it is desireable to come to
terms with the situation as you have done - though it
is not easy for me, as I am not assisted by my background.  But what you say is true - it is true for
me: after all I do not bite my nails as soon as we
separate and we both have each other's love even separated.  I cannot say how much this means to me; 
but you know, darling.

My Sylvia is now the marmalade cat through your industry is not entirely feline.  I feel that right
back in your cat-ancestry there is a slight impurity -
possibly of human stock?  I suggest this very tenta-
tively but the vast quantity of marmalade does speak
for itself. I'm looking forward to tasting in: as
you Dandylions are not averse to it at Breakfast.

Again you quote Clifford as saying we are lucky to
see each other only occasionally.  But how would he
like to have half a Rectory, half Leon Bloy's works,
a spoonful of brandy and not a cellar full.  Would
you rather have Holkham or a bungalow.  How splendid,
following Clifford's reasoning, if only Gothic England
were to be published by Penguin Books.  Of course fewer
illustrations and the appendices are omitted but it fits
the pocket so well.  Batsford would soon be bankrupt.
Holkham be partitioned for two hundred families from the
Gorbals, and so on.  And with a Digest you save time
and don't get that distressing sense of living with an

My dearest Sylvia
Sorry that this letter must be in pencil but as you know my pen ran out and I cannot afford a re-fill just now because it is a biro. Nor is the typewriter available.
What a great pleasure it is to me that you quote poetry and poets to me, now that the exam studies are over. Really, it is impossible to measure my joy. I found fragments of a poem by Charles de Orleans in an ancient anthology and liked them very much. It appears that his English poems were written in prison here. Digby, however, has not yet come my way. Where did you find him? Was he also on the wireless?
O, how wonderful is the Gordian knot image. How well it [unclear][/unclear] us-after all [unclear][/unclear] would ""undo"" us and the rareness of our meetings is, in my opinion, a test. Yes a trial and not, as Clifford believes, a help. ""The Gordian knot 'which true lovers knit undo it you cannot'. I love you for sending it to me both for its intrinsic beauty and its fittingness to us. How I long to see you, though even absence pulls the knot tighter.

Dearest.  Thank you for appreciating my poems as you do.  It arouses in me an urge to write more about you.  Your description of the result of my 'gifts' as you sweetly called them, upon you was exquisite.  I never want to hear again that you cannot write letters.

Your account of [unclear] Windy Ways interior [unclear]  was very cleverly done, too, so again, no more Cinderella stories about your letter craft.  It does sound - remarkable.  What courage the people who live there have to juxtapose such 'unexpected' pieces.

What can I tell you about tea with C. Johnson?  I kept him off aunts and he looked at the [unclear] vienna [unclear] catalogue with great interest and that really is all I can remember.  He showed me one or two drawings!  But that's all.  Gibson seems to have heard some of my lecture but Johnson won't commit himself.

To develop a theme of yours in your letter of 27th I must say that my recent past is congenial and indeed of great interest now.  I go back over places we have been to and things we have said. I associate you with the N.P.G of course, and also with Oxford Street above Liberty's where we argued once; with Toynbee Hall, and the pub and also the Royal Cinema in Edgware Road.  Oh and so many more: place names, images, phrases, subjects, whole conversations come back - occupy me.  With you at the centre of them all.  And yet, counter to this, the warm anticipation of our next meeting: counter to it and part of it for you have abolished conventional distinctions of time.

Dearest Sylvia, 

I have your darling letter beside me now and I need not tell you how much I look forward to receiving a dark pink rose. Like the Cavalier poet I shall know where Jove bestows the rose when June is over. I am excited to hear, too, that you hope to start the sketch for our double portrait. I cannot honestly share yours and Michael's pleasure about the rain since I want to sunbathe: already I have lost what color I had. And since I may miss the strawberries I have no interest in the fertility of peas and beans. Ugh; my rococo typewriter gave a tiny shudder, imperceptible to other fingers perhaps, as I put down the names of those vegetables. Yes, my dearest, the 18th is wonderful, and I shall come early, of course. Thank you so much; and do thank Michael too.

I hugely enjoyed your description of eleven o'clock on Sunday; Job, me, and your own delicious irreverence. I am glad too that your visionary dandylion was counter to Blakes's images also.",0,FALSE
10931609,gri_2003_m_46_b01_f05_010.jpg,"Your reflections on absence are very
logical but I hope that this time, on the
18th, it won't be difficult for you.  As
you know I swoon with pleasure at the mere 
sight of you.  What I think I shall try
and do is send an encouraging poem to you
on the 17th.  I am so happy that you enjoyed my last poems.  As soon as I had read your
letter this morning I wrote the poem which
accompanies this letter; inspiration is
thus simply, exactly, equated with you.
I adore your letters and have re-read many
recently but think that some of your 
last letters are the most expressive, the 
most precious.  But to go back to the theme
I started this paragraph with: much as I
miss you (see so many of my letters in the 
past) I have achieved a compromise by considering your letters part of you.  Not the 
fullest part, but important, covetable,
stimulating, full of echoes and shadows of
your self.  Since some kind of arrangement
had to be made, this is it, and each meet-
ing anew is not totally a new meeting, just
a filling out of what you have written, and
of what I remember.  I move that we try
and strike the word absence from our letters.

and dates are settling into place.  I talked
with Johnson on the phone on Monday evening
and he stressed the frequency of his conversations with Mother on the phone.  He thinks
she is the kind of person he would 'rather",0,FALSE

Evasions are becoming more strained and I at last had to say 'You must meet her some time' and he jumped at it. Eventually I shall have to manage it: what do you say to lunch at the salad bowl? At least no Father that way. I am furious with Johnson for prying like this despite my reserve. It also shows up the need for escaping 11 Mansel Road. I have not quite finished with him. He's nearly ill. He says his doctor has told him that 'nerves' are the matter with him. Familiar and meaningless enough but J. hints disquietingly at physical symptoms also. His eternal disappearances at the N.G., the Vega, and back at the N.G. all within the space of one hour are one manifestation and the other I don't know. Advancing age is on him too I fancy. If he does not relax and stop lunching, teaing, dining, with pupils, aunts, and lame dogs, I fear a crisis. Too late for Dr. Flugel to do any good, of course.

I envy you another Lady From Shanghai.

Did I tell you that Mandy (my cousin) offered me a bag of sweets, as I thought, the other day. I put my fingers in and drew out a - rose petal.

My dearest Sylvia:

Alas, that your dream about me should be an anxious
one and, since I participated, I feel most guilty.  I
hope it will not be repeated.  I know how unpleasant
it is to wake up after such dreams and feel unhappy - 
the feeling carried over from the dream and not dispelled by consciousness as it should be.  How I wish our
nights were spent together for I could then wake and put
my dream into effect at once for I will admit to you,
Sylvia, that my dreams are frequently about you but that
(to put it in the most sober terms) there is no frustration until I actually wake up.

I purred happily through your letter though it was
a concerned purr at your distressing dream.  I received a letter from Gibson at the same time in which he
says he well put my name on the list of occasional lecturers and that the fee has been raised to a pound.  He 
has an amazing signature, about the size of a fly, though
narrower  than any fly.

With rare clarity I imagine you in the Reference Library with the delicious world of Carpaccio open before
you.  As you said to me not long ago I would say now
to you ; 'You will be terribly learned'. 

Daily I imagine you, most often, I think, at Pett
where we have been so happy together and shortly are to
be again.  I see your picture above my bed and remember
how you lay by the sundial on your front and bent your
legs in the air and the skin crinkled at the back of your
knees.  Your lovely legs...  And you say you have al-
most completed a drawing.  I am so pleased.  In its
turn it reminds me of you drawing me in the evening at 
Pett and I recapture the ease and pleasure.  Do not for-
get my rose if there is time for roses will not be here
much longer.

The construction of the [unclear]song[/unclear] sequences was superb and, symbolism here, Welles goes down the steps into his cabin, [unclear]then[/unclear] up again, and as the sequence nears its close there are only close ups of himself and Hayworth.

your big letter with the drawings as
you seemed to be in the letter which
followed it. It was a lovely letter
and though you seem to feel that it
falls short of an ideal I did not feel
it, as it lined up, totally, to my ideal.
I agree with your discussion of love
and Sartre and agree, too, with your in-
vocation of Russell as an antidote to
Existentialism. I imagine what some
people dislike in Russell is the predominantly critical approach of much of his
work and they prefer the 'creative' non-
sense of existentialism, alas!

who is 'framed' for a crime he doesn't
commit. Evidence is faked to point to

My dearest Sylvia,
   I usually post my letters in a box at the end of the road, 
at the bottom of the hill. How many times have I been to
 it I wonder with letters for you. The phallic beast is insatiable, no matter how many letters I give it 
to eat. It is always there, telling me to write more often, at greater
 length: 'I've got room of hundreds more'.

   This evening I was restless and wanted exercise so I walked and walked. Through urban scenery all the way. Waste
land between factories and a dead railway line, Wandsworth
 Bridge with a dreary Whistlerian late sunset effect, two prostitutes teasing a mentally deficient cripple in a 'bus, a
 man having a fit and charging at a wall, crowds overflowing
 the pavements as they left Olympia. And finally a few rides 
in 'dodgem' cars at Hammersmith, symbolically swerving, bumping, charging. The result of this four hours is a convic-
tion of the Absurd (Camus). Coming back I passed the letter
 box with its mouth open.

   Today I went to Guildhall and saw some Spanish pictures
 from the Cook Collection, a group of great interest, including a portrait of Velazquez attributed to his mulatto servant. While in the neighbourhood I visited St Stephens
 Walbrook as you recommended some time ago and was delighted by the spatial effects inside as far as they were intelligible. Repair is going ahead fairly well it seems.

   I should have written above 'yesterday I went to the Guild-
hall'. It is now 12.20. I wonder if you are asleep? It is very close here for comfortable sleep. No owls tonight
 though often I can hear them in the great trees at the end
 of the garden. Yesterday in my long walk I saw three bushes
 of white roses by a canal, not far from Lady Hamilton's home
 in Mitcham. A pylon soared above them. They were deliciously creamy. The bushes nodded in unison at the touch of a
 wind.

   When I wake up I shall finish this letter; if I post it in
 good time you will get it for sure on Monday. Don't forget
 to give me instructions about your slides, for time is getting
 short. 18, 17, 16, 15, 14, 13, 12. It is the 12th already - 
just. I love you.

   Yes, I will most certainly go to the N.G. and get the postcards for you. I shall do so on Monday as I am meeting John-
son at noon there. And a bulb of garlic. Perhaps I better
 bring a bulb for everyone at the Rectory: is it vampyres?

My dearest Sylvia,

   This is just like 'old times' - writing you from my room again.  I do not think that nostalgia is satisfied by this, however, as at present, I only feel your absence.  It is fine weather today so I hope you can lie in the garden and relax and I do hope that life at the Rectory will be more calm now.  It is only now that, looking back, I fully realise the tension of the second week.  I love you; I wish it had been easier for you.  On the other hand, I wouldn't have missed a minute of it, being with you.

   I am writing this hastily; it is the lover's equivalent of a formal note of thanks after a holiday, a visit.  Thank you so much for having me, and, in particular, for painting me.  Dandylion feels very proud, head-and-shoulders above the other lions.  How much I adore you and I feel, as one always does, that there is so much I could have said but, somehow, didn't.  All that is clear is my happiness and I hope yours, too.

   A longer letter will follow shortly.  But meanwhile, thank you and I love you, love you, love you.

In my last letter there was not room for everything & one thing that got squeezed out was news of Molly. She is recovering - but too slowly. Ricky has behaved with rare stupidity and there have been rows that are now over and have made him see how serious a state she is in. So perhaps it will, temporarily of course, be easier for her. Her holiday starts next week. Iris will be there part of the time, but I shan't be there as Ricky won't have me.

Dearest Sylvia
Thank you for your two letters which reached me today. I think I will
put all the prosaic matters first: I
ordered your tea this afternoon and
they will send it to you and I have already dispatched your ration books.
It was most kind of you to send the 
marmalade to mother, she is very 
pleased with it, as a gift and for its
 taste. Thank you too for my slippers
and the comb. But what about the comb:
mine turned up at home (in my dressing gown pocket) so have you sent me
Michael's? I am very happy that
you are to have extra time in Italy.
You can still come to Wimbledon on
your return, I hope. I now have three
lectures at the N.G., all before you
return: Dutch genre (bugger), Velasquez and Zurbaran, and Hogarth. I asked

function of cementing us yet more firmly.
(I shall try and versify this, if I can.) Your
words about Hogarth are encouraging and
they have revived my interest in him. I
shall resume this letter tomorrow as it is
time I put the light out: I hope you are sleeping well, Sylvia. What shall I dream
about: the Princess [unclear][/unclear] with her sonnet
on her head, dressed in a charming new stanza
with alternate rhymes. A negro page
will fan her with a villanelle and her feet
will rest daintily on a roundel. There will
be a triolet on her fingers and, just possibly,
a couplet at the waist. I love you, Sylvia,

I have just had breakfast and soon it will
be eleven o'clock. I must be off shortly to
the V and A so I will stop at the end of this
page, send it off, and write another letter this
evening. In the space left I must tell you,
again, and in the same old terms I'm afraid,
how much I love you. Even when we are 
apart I feel you existing as a part of me and
giving me a purpose so that I feel I am making use of my liberty. Living is inconceivable

ONE THE EXTINCTION OF THE VENETIAN REPUBLIC

And was the safeguard of the west:  the worth
of Venice did not fall below her birth,
Venice, the eldest Child of Liberty.
She was a maiden City, bright and free;
No guile seduced, no force could violate;
And, when she took unto herself a Mate,
She must espouse the everlasting Sea.
And what if she had seen those glories fade,
Those titles vanish, and that strength decay;
Yet shall some tribute of regret be paid
When her long life hath reached its final day:
Men are we, and must grieve when even the

Dearest Sylvia: 

When the pain of missing you is strong 
an anodyne is to remember my previous condition.  I have flattered it with the 
name Autumn but it had not that season's
satisfaction - it did not conclude a summer. 
It was autumn before summer.  Sentiment-
ally I used then to wish that I could say 
to myself I had experienced love once:
that I felt would ease me in my unloving
state.  Now I am loved Sylvia but you are 
rarely with me.  I believe in your love
and that makes me wish harder for your 
presence.  Ironic is it not?  But here I 
remember a warning:  not to expect too
much.  With you I have realised my dream 
and found it sweeter than I supposed
it could be.  But I still wish for more. 
However, seeing the position fairly cooly
should make it easier.  I am worried by 
the thought that perhaps this confession
will upset you.  I can anticipate this, 
however, because as you see your love is 
what I never really dared to expect.  You
have made me happy and it is unreasonable
to want more.  Indeed I think in a way it 
would be rather superhuman not to want more and you would be right to resent it, if 
this were the case.  I am the first to ad-
mit Michael's importance to you.  This 
fact just does not deter my libido I regr-
et to say and it tends to treat attempts",0,FALSE
10931670,gri_2003_m_46_b01_f06_040.jpg,"to check it contemptuously.  I think, al-
though wishing my comfort you would not wish
my love milder.  Anymore than I would.
Thus you see my love, now it has come, dismisses the limitations I had supposed I
would accept before I was in love.  What
price for my early dogma about love, now.
I adore you Sylvia and do not worry about
me.  It is your love, which you gave so
tenderly and fiercely, I want and not your
worry.  My dearest Sylvia, I love you.

It's that I feel anything is rather an anti-climax
but I want to ask you about your exam-result.
Is Clifford going to open it if it comes in
your absence?  You talked with him, or Tiny,
as if he would.  If so, would he, or they, do you
think, let me know?  A simple line would 
do, but I should like to know... Please.
I hope your tea has come by now.  Dandylion
is sipping China tea even now and that reminded him.  I have got yet another lecture,
the fourth, at the Gallery, on the 18th -
on landskip.  A nice easy subject, that one.
""Please find enclosed an article on Canaletto
and Venice which may interest you"".  Except for a judgment about his figure drawings I like it.

I expect you are busy but I hope not too
busy.  All my love.

My dearest Sylvia,

Thank you very much for your letter. It came second post yesterday, just as I had finished sunbathing and before I left for the V and A. Then in the evening I went to the Lyric to see Les Maines Salles again. Here am I trying desperately to keep in touch with French culture and you write from the middle of it: the Luxembourg gardens is where you wrote from. It is still very vivid in my mind's eye though when I was there the lawn was distinctly brown and by no stretch of imagination green. It sounds so much nicer now I must say.

The list of buildings you have visited would make anybody but myself feel guilty. All I saw was Ste. Sulpice: I am glad you all enjoyed the Delacroix and I must say I liked his frescoes there and the ceiling in the Louvre more than any of the easel paintings in the Petit",0,FALSE

My dearest Sylvia,

    How varied are the sheets on which I record my continuous longing for you:  all shapes and sizes and colors, yet all written with a single purpose.  Your own pile of letters, that is my collection of your letters, apart from one enormous sheet, have a unity of color and size.

    Are your movements after Sienna decided yet?  Also will you and Michael be able to get to Venice?  Is J.C. Loquacious on trains?  Your head must be full of colors and images and Italian names.  Everybody is going abroad.  Well, anyway, John McHale and Albert are going to Italy shortly and John to Paris on Saturday.  Ho hum.

    You don't want the essay on Pope's illustrations sent to Italy do you?  I'm revising it a bit.  As soon as I have time I shall, to be more accurate.  Also I hope to write a companion piece on another subject.

    I don't imagine you have much time for drawing do you, with the works of so many other artists to see?  I keep thinking of our double portrait, trying to visualise the landscape you have put in since I saw it.

I am fairly pink from sunbathing now but today has been too erratic to be undressed.  If only the sun keeps up for a week or two I shall not be too pale on your return.

    This letter and the preceding one are a bit fragmentary I'm afraid but it is because I am trying to think out large bits of my book and consequently am not really fit for much else in the way of writing at the moment.  But I could not avoid the opportunity to assure you again of my love for you.

There is a Regency festival at Brighton now but I doubt I shall see it.  I would have liked to but unless Robert Hart takes me I don,t give much for my chances.

    Pablo recently has spent several nights out - celebrating his recovery - and he usually comes in about nine and settles down on one of the beds where he stays until tea-time:  then we both have tea, as I told you.

    I hope my next letter will be better composed.

I miss you.  I love you.

It is just after a quarter to ten and I expect you are Hastings. I do hope that your bas[unclear][/unclear] ran at the summertime. I do hope so. Forgive my selfishness in wanting to keep you as long as possible. Now, thinking about it, I am concerned. 

Oh how many delights your visit gave me. To do justice to them[unclear][/unclear]is impossible (words betray me) and to make a list would be an infinite task. So I shall content myself with saying -once again ( and, I am sure not for the last time) - how much i love you and how very much I appreciate your love for me despite the difficulties you have to content unites[unclear][/unclear]. I treasure your love. It is the touchstone by which I measure myself.

Your new clothes are beautiful as well as my pleasure in them as fashionable creations there was delight in that you had some new things[unclear][/unclear]",0,FALSE

I had a good night. I only hope that you did too. It is eight o'clock in the morning. Soon I must have breakfast. Aren't we outrageous about the times we had our meals? Yesterday evening, after your train had gone - I'm so glad I came to East Croydon - I could not get adjusted to the time. By being together as we were and living only for that, the progress of hours and so on is quite dislocated. The power of love is immense.

[unclear]see[/unclear] it is not a bright day but I hope the light is good enough at Pett for you to do your painting comfortably.

Between my heart and my tummy I feel a strange fluttery feeling when I think of you. It is there now. Sometimes, I tremble briefly. These physical symptoms of love will grow less frequent as I get into my work but you know my love is fixed and cannot lessen.

Last night I rang [unclear]Johnson[/unclear] and he was a bit cool. I apologized and we are having lunch together. The Soane Museum in the afternoon, then, for me. But your heart will be there and your presence, your wit and your appreciation of the house and pictures live in me.

My dearest Sylvia
I hope that Michael and you are settling down at Pett and that your visit to me has not made Micheal too unhappy. I know how hard it is for you when he is depressed so I hope you are getting along happily.
Johnson asked me if you were back yesterday. I said I thought you must be by now as I had had a ""note"" from Venice the week before in which you promised a return soon but gave no date. I hope that is the right sort of thing to say.

You spoke with interest of Klingender's new book. I saw it in the library and have borrowed it to send to you. Don't feel obligated to read it (I haven't) but the pictures and notes are very interesting.

Dearest Sylvia,
I know it is wicked of me to write twice in one day when I have work to do and you have michael to think of. Still I feel I must write a few lines.
Thank you for sending me Clifford's [unclear]Ganseation[/unclear] from [unclear]Luchs[/unclear]. I have written a note to him which I shall post this evening - later than this letter - because I have to get some stamps.
This quotation may amuse you. It is from a ([unclear]1608[/unclear] handbook for painters - by LOMAZZO:
'Wanton embracings are also of diviers forms, and must alwaies be expressed with this regarde, that the handes as the instrumentes thereof, doe touch the most tender partes of the body'. ((16th translation which Mo-
[unclear]garth[/unclear] read.) 
Today I have written about 2000 words. I believe I must have thought of you at least 2000 times. Perhaps I should say you are never out of my mind. O, what pleasure re-reading your twin-letters. You have, in the past, apologised for yourself as being a poor letter writer. This is quite wrong (here at least I venture to contradict minerva, though rarely else) for I catch in your words exquisite modulations of mood and thought so that I share the thoughts behind your words. If this is not the secret of letter writing what can it be!
Another thing your letters do is encourage my love by revealing yours to me. And yet my love is implicit in the words you write originally. I hope my letters do the same, for to lovers who one separates silence is the worst torment, I am sure. It is impossible to define the reciprocal subtleties of love yet how strongly we feel them and how piercing the experience of recognition.
I love you

Dearest Sylvia,
I have been going to bed fairly early recently and
I woke at 7.30 this morning. Immediately I ran down-
stairs, so eager that I forgot my parents might be up
and did not put anything on, and found TWO letters on
the mat for me. Oh, imagine my delight. I inspected
the postmarks and took care to read them in order. (My
parents were not up I should, perhaps, say.)
Alas, it is what I feared, that 'the situation is
very tense'. My poor Sylvia, I know that dreadful
numbing despair you experienced. I am sure that sunbathing and painting will make it diminish. I am
fairly tranquil again - inasmuch as the ache which I
thought would never stop, a physical feeling, has a-
bated. In your second letter you have news of a 
portrait of Michael you have started: this I am sure
is good for both of you and I expect sitting still for
you will arouse in Michael the desire to paint again.
Yesterday I went on the river with Johnson
and the Poisers. It was dull but I got a lot of exercise since Philip and I did nearly all the rowing as
Johnson was satisfied to steer. That is what I wanted
anyway. Johnson and I are quite alright again now.
No 'coolth' at all. He has given me a letter for the
B.M. library which I have sent off.
By the way, what about Michael's portrait of You?
And speaking of Michael's painting reminds me: I can
get Biro refills without giving up the inside of my
pen now if he wants one for drawing. The Piccadilly
branch just gives you the nib and ink tube and you do the changing
yourself. They are 2s.3d. each.
I am surrounded by books and papers. I am working
on the Harlot's and the Rake's Progress. With luck
I shall finish that section of my book before the end
of the week. I shall work all afternoon, despite the
invitation to sunbathe. Perhaps I shall snatch an
hour about tea time.
I remember that you told me once how, after a visit
to Pett, you peopled the rooms, the chair I sat in, and
so on, with me. That is exactly what has occurred since
your visit here. Apart from my continual thought about
you - vivid, actual recollections are called up by all
the rooms you went in, all the things you touched. The
sunflowers on the curtains have become symbolic. You ",0,FALSE
10931708,gri_2003_m_46_b01_f07_037.jpg,"must advise me where to put my bed in the Autumn when a fire becomes occasionally necessary. See below.

Fine weather will, I am sure, continue so that Apollo can warm you as you sunbathe in the garden. How clearly I see you. I remember you against the white sheets. You were never more Venetian than at that moment. Oh but you are Venetian all the while in so many complex and ravishing ways. I am sure that if I look in on Richter I shall find mention of a Minerva by Giorgione at Pett.

It was nice to receive your headed paper again. SYLVIA SLEIGH in blue capital letters. It reminded me of that early sketch (in the writer's possession, as they say) which you drew early in our love. It was the first time I had ever been sketched. O, I love you, Sylvia Sleigh.

Your suggestion of Tunbridge Wells or Sevenoaks is wonderful. Knole would be a treat. As soon as you have the date definitely fixed I shall see about arranging it. If the Macdonalds come on the 11th would you like to make it a day earlier? You tell me. Later we might be able to see Penshurst. 

Johnson made me furious yesterday: he old the Poisers that he had lent you money on the holiday. I wanted to be terribly cutting. Don't fear, I shall not be, but what a bastard he is, to be sure. Have you noticed he is afraid of using your name properly? An odd kind of 'slllerr' or something very odd like that, does duty instead.

How I love you. Imagination and reality both bring me back to that simple fact. I miss you desperately but think of you and the time scaling down between now and our next meeting. Really, you know, I must get back to Hogarth. But I must say, once more, I love you and that my thoughts never leave you. Dearest Sylvia.

Oh Sylvia,
     Your letter breaks my heart, when I think of your grief.  Let me say, before writing another word, that my love for you has not diminished in any way whatsoever.  Every meeting confirms the wonderful happiness I knew first last January, confirms and deepens.  Oh, my dearest, believe in my love, as I believe in yours.  If you had admitted me fully into your plan of 'not trying' Michael I should not have been so stupid.  Remember, too , in extenuation, that your letters previously had been but frail bridges over the chasm between us.  I want no-one but you:  you had been a tiny bit callous about Michael's freedom to love you , and I was stung.  Forgive me and be assured of my fidelity.  My clumsiness on Monday does not discount all I have said in the past.  I can sustain my love for you  (I can do nothing else).  Absence and parting may confuse us but they cannot untie our Gordian Knot anymore than we could ourselves.  My idea of a lover was only an attempt, like yours, to reach a working compromise and I must confess that an even greater obstacle than your unhappiness is my own lack of appetite for another.  I want none other.  On the one hand there is the great love I bear you and on the other the need not to distress you too much by my demands which upset your life at Pett.  This latter need has been eclipsed simply because we have not had even our minimum share of loving and I feel too fiercely.  What you can reproach me with, perhaps justly, is loving you too much so that I have forgotten where your best interests lie as far as everyday living is concerned.  And though I do understand the importance of your home (not less for lacking one of my own) I believe you will forgive me for my clumsiness.  Clifford's letter recommended me not to make 'extreme demands' and I have always tried not to.  But I am so glad that he endorses my suggestion of a fortnightly meeting as reasonable.  I die to see you so we may both die.  I will understand if it is impossible to see you before Bath (though you know what I hope, villain that I am), but the 30th is not desperately far away.  Clifford recommends we be 'Realistic, reasonable, and patient'.  I agree with him but believe we have a claim to meeting sometimes, alone.  I adore you, love you, and though I am aware that our desire creates difficulties I would not and know now that you would not, have it reduced.  My love is strong and I believe in the equality of our love.

Dearest Sylvia, 
'Make not my glad cause, cause of mourning'. 
George Peele.

Your letter moved me very much. My first
thought after receiving it was to phone or wire
you. The post seemed too slow. But I realised 
it is the only mode of communication full enough
and private. This morning you will have read my
letter.

I know well that your past has been bitter and 
I do hope that its memories have not been roused
by my words on Monday. If so I ask you to forgive
me and remember, not that clumsiness, but the moments I have pleased you.

I remember that we worked out an intellectual
basis for our love. I think it still holds. The
fact that I desire more than I get is not incompatible with reality - for reality in this case could
be a little more generous than things-as-they-are.

The words of yours that wring my heart are 'worn
out'. I know what they mean - indifference born of 
pain, and I only hope your suffering has not had this effect this time for I hope you are persuaded
again of the sincerity and energy of my love. 

Have you felt like painting yet? Your portrait
of Michael is a step in the direction you have
wanted to go - towards more descriptive drawing
though I am delighted your color has not been in 
the last sacrificed. 

For Sylvia
Mirrors compete
For my lady's form,
Are sad to lose
Her lovely arms,
Browned by the sun, 
When she turns to me;

Reflect her beauty 
More surely than the glass, 
For to her images
I add desire
And confidence of grace.

16th September 1948

Dearest Sylvia,

Thank you so much for your nice fat letter. It was both thoughtful and gay and I was glad for both halves. Glad for the description of you and Michael at present because it does help me. Glad for the charming Minervan passages because it is time we were cheerful again.

Your White Owl arrived this morning quite early and gave me news of you. When we heard the post come he winked at me and said: 'There's one for you. No. Stay there - I'll get it'. The Tawny Owl patronises him a little but is genuinely fond of him. I have, however, warned the White One against certain traps for Owls in the West End of London where it is not safe for him to venture. He said that he would be safe because you would appear in a cloud if he was in danger and carry him off as you did for many Greek heroes. But I persuaded him it was unfair to disturb you as you were busy painting and 'with a wisdom beyond his years' he agreed. Still, I'm glad the Tawny One will keep an eye on him. Thank you, Minerva, for him: I shall sacrifice a kiss morning and night on your altar (it is in the rose-corner of my room). Yesterday the three of us visited the exhibition of Picasso lithographs and were especially struck by five owl pictures (you will just be in time to see them when you come to town.). The Tawny Owl says it is a speaking likeness of an owl he knew during the war (he was in the Free France Owls) named Pierre Hibou. The White Owl wants his portrait done now. I have told him that only you can do him.

I am so happy about the reflection. The fact it is solid, like Michael's portrait and my fauve one, shows surely that your drawing advances in the way you desire. 

My address in Bath is: c/o Mrs Lyttle, 64 St. John's Road, Bathwick, Bath, Somerset. (Bathwick is essential.) I shall be there from the 18th to about the 23rd. I hope you will write to me there for be sure I shall write to you. Both owls are looking forward to the trip. I have sent the White Owl out in my duffle coat to see if he can 'pick up' a good book on Bath for me.

How re-assuring it was to get your letter this morning in an unfamiliar landscape though I am sorry that your news is not all happy.  Perhaps things are easier by now: I need not tell you how strongly I hope they are.  Alas, that your landscape is not to your liking yet but I am sure it is only a matter of time.

Some of the Cook Collection is on view here, including a Hogarth portrait and the early Purification of Temple by el Greco.  By the way, the Burlington subscription has gone through alright.

You are never out of my thoughts. Imagination and memory combine to haunt and enchant me.  How vividly I remember our winter run on the beach.  It was then I think the blue satyr prompted my earliest poems for you.  Yes I'm sure it was.  Sad as I am without you my pleasure in the country and fine weather consoles me, for landscape in England is intimately bound up with your presence, now.  I remember when I was in Paris you said the spring wind on the nape of your neck was like my kiss.  How I observe the wind now, soft yet confident, combing the valley and the secret groves.  But I do not need the pathetic fallacy to convey how much I love you.  It is only ten days to the 30th.  I long to see you so that we can be cruelly gay about Johnson again.  But of course that is only one of many reasons and one from low down on the list.  But you are so amusing and it's one quality I value in you.  And the others?  Well you know.

I remember thinking how amused you would have been at it and how interested on account of my own taste for follies and the grotesque. This morning at that time I was at another folly, Brown's, this time, with a fine view and a great tower behind me. Tomorrow I shall be looking at Georgian Bath. I shall indeed be thinking of you.

Dearest Sylvia,
I am very glad that an arrangement has been reached and I look forward to the opportunity of discussing it with you. It seems cruel of Michael to keep you to himself in London considering he has you to himself in Pett as well. Do let us meet and talk alone, even if he does succeed in denying us more. But I remember what you hoped and I still hope. Do not upset your visit however for it.
You must not feel guilty about your part in this situation - remember its origins. And for my part, I have not stopped loving you, nor can I conceive of doing so.

How I look forward to seeing you again.  It really shouldn't make much difference but I feel much more distant from you than I do at Wimbledon.  I love you, dearest, and anticipate continuing to do so, long enough to refute Clifford's gloomy dogma - for dogma it seems to be.  Possibly even long enough to set all your doubts at rest.

It is a fine warm morning.  The sun is warm on my bare back as I write.  I am sure the weather will do a lot to ease you (provided it is fine in Sussex).

Dearest Sylvia,

I, too, have been walking among hawthorn and
wild rose hedges, in the hills around Bath.

I am charmed by your slip: I wish it could
have been realised in fact. Dandylion is most
attached to the sun at Pett. (Changing identities rapidly I must confess that Apollo saw to
it that he had good weather at Bath.)

By the way, Dandylion, Apollo, Lawrie Scarlett,
and me, are all delighted that your painting is
easier again. Four heartfelt congratulations.

On the 30th and 31st of October my parents
will be away. Do you think that you could time
one of your visits on one of those days, or both?
Would that be possible? My parents go away but
rarely and it would save money.

Back in town I can tell you the name of the
translator of the Carracci sonnet - Creighton
Gilbert, an American. Another thing I learned
on my return to the capital was that Les Mains
Sales came off last Saturday. I am sorry to
play about like this but it is of course unavoidable.

I have not heard from Lines yet?

About Cooper: I think he is too rough with
Modigliani. I object when he says ""De Chirico's
images have no subjects... they cannot be explained"". His omission of Severini is cavalier.
It is early to make some of the claims he does for the later Italians. But interesting nonetheless.

I am glad your wardrobe is nearing completion.
(Alas I don't think my trousers from Pett Fete will be ready in time.)

I feel quite agitated when I think how near our next meeting is. I will write again tomorrow.
I love you.

My dearest love,
It is an eternity since I talked to you, though the clock
puts it at nine and a half hours ago. Love does not make
the kind of time that clocks can tell us about. Therefore
I must write : my hand is weighted by all I want to write
but which I can only speak and, better, reveal by action.
I shall resist tonight the fierce desire I have to ring you -
just to wish you 'sleep well' and to hear your voice for
a moment. That would be wonderful but I will hold
back for your sake.
Be assured of my love, Sylvia. I long for you and
the chance to prove in so many ways what my love means.
How beautiful you are : I know you will say that you are
'[unclear]battered[/unclear]' now but, remember, your beauty makes my
heart beat faster. When I hold your locket to the
light the stones glow a dark-red like fire. It is an emblem
of my longing as well as a token of your love. How precious
it is to me.
Today I have worked on [unclear]Mozarts[/unclear] and your image has 
been present all the time : every word is dedicated to you.
I have helped you to paint. You have given me the [unclear]nature[/unclear] to
write prose and, I need not say; you are the very substance of my poetry. I must tell you that [unclear]basic[/unclear] in my
love for you is recognition of what Pett means to you :

the point of communicating your distaste of the town. My

Beleaguered as we are
By miles of cubist rooftop
And great allegiances
We are not separated
For the heart still knows desire
The lips tremble as for a kiss
The hand is ready to paint
what it cannot paint alone
And the future waits for us

I know that absence is not on our side but in my  poem I
have tried to record some victories over it. Do
you find, as you used to, that parting works against the
one you are separated from? If so it is a sign of your
fine love that you love me still. I believe in your love
- you know that - and long for an expression of it when not
pitted against dangers and difficulties. I have a two -
fold longing - that you can be tranquil again and
that I can give you my love daily, a love you need, I
believe, not less than I need to give it to you.

results. I shall write to you this evening. I love you,

Sylvia, dearest, your torment breaks my heart. Do not find in this a fresh course for grief because it is rather a sign of my continuing love. At a time like this existentialist dogma may seem true but it is at times like this we can judge matters least clearly. I wonder if this is not the unconscious determining factor in Michael's condition about us not meeting when we are so close in geography. It makes me seem remote though in fact I am not. Recognise this darling because though 'absence' leads to a sense of psychological separation the role of absence is the one you ask of me. Do recognise this darling for it is imperative that you think about Michael's actions as well as suffer from them. Does not that poem, not very good in itself I admit, remind you of our bonds - I mean the one in my last letter but one? I want to see you before you return to Pett long enough to reassure you of my physical reality and my undiminished love. I leave the arrangement totally to you and I do not expect the opportunity to consummate - just to see you for a short while and talk, not analytically or pleadingly, but just to say things which may soothe you. Don't forget I shall be in all Friday except lunch time.

Sylvia, my dearest Sylvia. ...I am unsure now how to go
on. Love betrayed my speech this morning and I fear to
vex you again. But write I must and there is nothing I
want to say more than 'I love you'. This morning we criticize one another. Please believe I was motivated only
by a desire to ease this anxious suspense. Not by distrust,

I have typed about 4000 words on The Background of The Analysis of Beauty today. Is it possible these familiar words

What a nice day it is. I feel rather a prisoner. Dandy-

busy day today so I hope that you have a sound night's sleep to-
night as a result. I wish this with all my heart. I hope you
get to the Wallace alright and I am sure the Philips will do you
lots of good. I shall think of you. I have got ham for dinner so will not harm. What did you have for lunch in the end?
Your owls send their love. I explained that I was sending so much
of mine that there would not be much room but they said it was the
thought that counted. So rest assured of my love which I swear
to you is as strong as ever. I love you: I've written those

they carry to you.

A CONVERSATION PIECE

The small valleys curve like roses
In the landscape near the level,
To fields where you pick mushrooms
Among asymmetrical farms.
But looking at the characters,
Formal in the foreground,
It is your privilege to guess
If one is a poet, if another
Is his particular desire,
And who their dark companion is - 
What purpose links them on the lawn.
There is a sundial for an arm
To rest on as we pose, the grass
Is rich as salad underfoot.
Light flatters the Sussex house
And whispers to a woman's hair.
These people love, have problems,
But who they are you must decide.
They have not quite made up their minds.

GOLDEN AGE

An island of roses and statues
Covered with ladders of stars.
 A dream of love, cupboard of flesh,
And hair shy of the gift of the wind.

Pleasures of  desire, the birds
Who pant like girls against the clouds,
The fish, green biscuits of the wave,
Obsess the islander.

Smooth girl, soft secular one,
Bored by the wolf and the worm
Glass flowers marooned on islands
Sleep on the poet's tongue.

Victim of my senses my heart
Quivers like a rose by Fragonard.

Dearest Sylvia,

What a shame Michael returned when he did. However I must finish what I was saying on the 'phone. I started to say that I depended on you entirely. Then I thought of the excessive demands Michael had been making on you and I feared to renew your emotional exhaustion. So I put it in a way which still expressed my love but which did not put you under an obligation. But let me repeat: you are my motive for working as I am now and that is a practical sign of the love I have for you. Of its more intimate expressions I need not speak, in relation to the book.

Oh the pleasure of hearing your voice three times on the phone today. It is too much and it stimulates me to write, though hastily, this note to you my dearest. 

You are a lovely creature. Yesterday, even as we stung each other, I was aware of your beauty and admiring the way you tipped your head to look at a picture and your delicious profile was posed against a 'golden master'.  And lots more. I adore you. It is so important our love: consider how, when we are alone together, we defeat Time. No, not defeat Time, that is too strong an action. We exclude him simply by our concentration on each other. Indifference to time is the way. And your beauty vanquishes time wholly for me so that I am left delighted, delighting, in you.

Enchantress, lover, Minerva, painter, I adore you.

I must have tea and get back to work. I shall post this now. By the way, would you after all let me have the Burlington magazine money: it is only 19s. You can make it, as Charles would say, 18s. 9d, as you have put aside a three penny piece for me. Thank you for remembering that, it is charming of you.

Do not think this deluge of Letters absurd. I know I ought to have written one long orderly one rather than three scattered ones, but I want to make contact with you so strongly that I forget the propriety of writing. Forgive this.

What I want to say, but shirked in the other letters, is important. My heart and mind are centred on this matter. Do not despair.

I can imagine what Tiny and Clifford will think of Michael and me and, my God, won't they be right! I am sorry and I can only say that I think I have learned.

is replaced by a uniform edition.

The weather is a little more pleasant than when I first wrote so I hope

did not realise that he was contemporary with Giorgione. It may give you

I hope two letters on your first day back will not bother you. Perhaps I should let you rest completely. But I believe letters would be better than silence. Tell me if you think not. I want to make amends for hurting you.
I have had cause to complain that I have memories of you in too many places where I go often in the course of my work and relaxation.

Love has an island where Desire 
Played the landscape gardener - 
Made grottoes out of moss and crystal 
And obelisks of gold. 

Transparent rivers glitter 
Above the darting finny tube 
In coral palaces, 
Spanned by bridges in the Chinese taste. 

Here labyrinths of roses, 
And spires of hyacinth, 
Give deep desire a living form, 
Enchanting much the senses.

Your letter was very precious to me and I was delighted at your appreciation of my poems which was elegant and generous.  Your poet-laureate could not fail to respond to your tribute so I have written, though rather quickly, the following sonnet.  The idea is that the rococo interest in ruins as interior decoration is a way of rejecting their psychological meaning which you mentioned to me the other day.  The poem has a cast of three:

Except for a few lines of washing, wind-stirred,
A cowherd wandering among the statues, (noseless victims of the barbarians).

Dearest Sylvia,

  The letter with the Richmond & c. postmark was posted outside Kew. Though the gardens were overpoweringly autumnal the greenhouses provided a kind of claustrophobic summer refuge. Queen Mary was there in the afternoon also and she went into the pagoda - something I have never been able to do, alas. I should like to see the interior of that rococo phallus. There is a nice Greek revival temple, there, dedicated to your William , as well as the one to Bellona which has shield and helmet metopes. This letter, however, must be posted in Wimbledon, Tumbrildon I think is a better name. I learn that there is an Angelica Kauffman staircase here so must arrange to see it. Today I am going to St Bartholomew's to see the librarian and archivist as well as the paintings - your appreciation of which encouraged me very much as a time when I had been a bit dubious about Hogarth. I am flattered by your remarks on my book and Antal's. Thank you very much for your belief in me. 

Dearest - writing letters at ten past eight in the morning! I shall do the same for you and then you will never doubt my love. How could you after such proof: I treasure your letter more than the skin of the Lion of Nemea. Thank you so much for your industry and love. I am sure between us we will give sore shoulders and torn sacks to you respective postmen. What a pity we were not corresponding at Castle Hedingham for the postman there, I think he was the postoffice too, was a dwarf who just reached the handlebars of his own bicycle. A certain pleasure there is in the thought of such a one being the messenger of love. (I should wear my Beccafumi fungus button hole for every delivery.)

So glad that you are profiting from Klinggender. Glad, too, that it is your intention to get on with our painting - there have been disquieting delays in its execution. Perhaps, one day, following on you charming remarks about me in a fitting jacket, you will paint me in a kind of Devis full-length, everything tight yet fairly graceful. Speaking of tight clothes - you should see my 'fete'-al' trousers. My dress lately had been slightly restrained but I am off again. Mother is dismayed. Father, usually indifferent and unconscious, pale. They are a good color and still nice and long but I have to wriggle my legs into them. I almost have that Sir Boothby Bart look.

I love you, and I should adore to heap you with baskets of slave bangles and marshmallow, but I can only offer this letter and news of my love which can never stop. I love you.

Dearest Sylvia,

How are you? I hope every trace of your neuralgia has gone. I remember how it lingered once before, but I tell myself it is Wednesday already so you should be recovered.

I look in vain for a way to vary my declaration of love, but I must hope that your need to read the words equals my need to write them - I love you, and long for the opportunity to say them to you. I love you so much.

I want to write a lover's alphabet. Will you collaborate? For example: C is for Cupid, curled up asleep; D is desire which burns when he wakes. H is for Hymen, honey and hair. L is for Lawrence, longing for you. S is for Sylvia, sacrifice to liberty. And so on. Send me some suggestions - even single words please.

Le Diable au Corps is exquisite though harrowing. The main point is the boy's evasion of responsibility for his actions which are immaturely motivated. Micheline Presle was, perhaps, a shade passive. I was moved by it very much indeed. Pictorially it is a delight and the action compels attention from beginning to end.

Also I saw a film called The Pirate with new Cole Porter songs including one that amused me called Be A Clown:
If you become a doctor, folk'll face you with dread.
If you become a dentist, they'll be glad when you're dead.
But people always love you if you can stand on your head.
Be a clown, be a clown?&c.

The sun is on me as I type and makes me think how nice it must be at Pett, cold I imagine, yet fine and crisp. Oh, dear.

It is nearly eleven o'clock and so time to tell you once more, that my thoughts never leave you. You possess me even in absence though I hasten to remark that this is not a reason to make you think absence from me is easier than from Michael. I love you and long for our weekend. Do make it two    nights. I love you.

'Now whoever
can conceive lines thus constantly flowing, and delicately varying

word Taste when applied to form'. This tells us a great deal
about Hogarth's view of the human body, mobile, ever-changing,
expressing the life-force itself by an unquenchable variety. We
must not forget, however, that behind Hogarth's
interest in varied surfaces in his grasp of solid form, [unclear]which[/unclear] he demonstrates
in the introduction

It follows from this that Hogarth rejects the tyranny of the table of
ideal proportions drawn up [unclear]out [/unclear]only by Dürer but by Lomazzo, for he recognises
the infinite variations of the body cannot be covered by [unclear]states[/unclear] measurements.
Every movement, as Hogarth points out, [unclear]reveals[/unclear] a change,
of muscle and a new distribution of weight, 
The eye is to be the arbiter of proportion. As it is in
the amazing profusion of form displayed in Hogarth's art.
(and that as the [unclear]French[/unclear] rococo [unclear]equally[/unclear])
As a
result of relying on the eye his estimation of Nature is higher than

will say that he has not seen faces and necks, hands and arms in
living [unclear]woman[/unclear], that even the Grecian/Venus doth but coarsely imitate?'
That Hogarth is well aware of his unorthodoxy is shown by a footnote
in which he compares artists he calls 'nature menders' with 'Gulliver's taylor at
Laputa, who, having taken measure of him for a suit of clothes, with 
a rule, quadrant, and compasses, after a considerable time spent,
brought them home ill made'.",0,FALSE

Dearest Sylvia,

   How pleasant it must be at Pett this weekend, the wea-
ther being what it is.  I hope that you will not forget Apollo's
part.  I have been reading Jung and it has been wonderful
to find all our allusions, images, symbols, games, referred
by him to the creative energy of libido and never to any
of the destructive varients.  The sun, the word 'gold', even the 'flames' round your locket combine in a unified expression of love.

   You are magnificient:  your body, your intelligence.
I love you.

   I long for You, Sylvia.  I think of you continually.
Never allow our love to be interferred with by circumstances
or by guilt.  I love you.  You have remembered what I said
to Clifford.  It is true: if only we could have the chance
to show it in a sustained experience.  I love you, Sylvia,
and have felt no diminution of desire.  Nor will I.
I long for more than a single meeting once a month.  I love
you as I am sure you believe again.

   Tell me how you feel about things now.  Has the feel-
ing if indifference gone?  If so, what has replaced it?
Each other's love is so necessary:  yours to me and mine
to you.  I am so much in love with you that I sometimes
almost believe that I shall appear at Pett in a power-
ful libido (or is it  lagonda or what?)  and carry you away,
screaming, faintly so as not to arouse anybody.  I love
you.

   I hope you have a nice week-end with the Philips.
I imagine you  in various dresses and envied them their
privilege which I am sure they appreciated.

   This evening I am going to Molly's: Iris, Charles,
and some other people will be there.  I think I shall
risk my fete trousers for the first time socially.  Please,
Minerva, accept this letter as an offering from the altar
in the rose alcove.  Now I shall be alright.

   What I wonder are the things you have to tell me which
you inhaled at in your provocative and loving last letter?
How I treasure those words of love.

   You forgot to tell me by the way if I can see  your tree-
picture, if it is in London yet.  Do tell me.

Dearest Sylvia,

In future I shall certainly address my letters more
fully. Even though it means sacrificing the Nichol-
sonian simplicity of Rectory Lodge, PETT, Sussex, I can-
not bear that letters intended for you should go to 
littlehampton and orpington (!) so 'nr. Hastings' will
go on in future.

Your account of my portrait's refusal to unbend
vexes the original very much. When I come to Pett I
shall surreptitiously (spelling?) effect an exchange - 
send my portrait back with the lantern slides and take
the portrait's place so you will, I think, have no
more complaints of inattention.

About Michael's coming and going. What can I say?
That is, except I love you and I say this with fervour
and sincerity, my darling. I love you.

I am not entirely sure about my trousers. Michael
(It's a dream, it's Harella) Rivett said they would be
alright in London where people would understand that
'the effect' was deliberate. Molly had misgivings.
Gossip? I don't recall any. The evening was curious-
ly elevated. Jung, Mithra, Oracles, Guilt, Confession,
and me in my strongest anti-Christian vein (thinking of
similar tirades by yourself). Iris is planning a book
on the social background of English art - for school
use, which is useful, don't you think? Iris' Friend,
Andre something, a novelist of adventure, rather than
an adventurous novelist, talked with me about my book
from a technical point of view which was helpful.

I have got a superb glimpse of Hogarth's unconscious
from Jung. I was reading him as a change from H after
finishing three chapters and came on it almost at once.
By the way, I've read Rosenau's book on David, which is
stimulating but incomplete.

I have checked with Victoria and your usual train
does run on Saturday so I shall meet it at 11.3.

This afternoon I intend to read as much as I can of
a new possession - Rosemary Freeman's English Emblem
Books. I am glad you painted yesterday afternoon.
Perhaps today too? I shall think about you and adapt
even celestial emblems to do you homage, dearest one.",0,FALSE

I saw Robert Hart and as far as I can
make out things are no worse than when
you were in Italy and the wine-tax seems to
be negligible. The exhibition at the
Palazzo Strozzi included Castagno frescoes
and the Donatello bronze doors but not, I
asked specially, any Titians. There was
a suite of Empire furniture, made in Genoa,
where the style was popular. When Hart
went to Palazzo Publico in Siena he
found an American film company there and
the frescoes powerfully illuminated as a
background for Tyrone Power who is playing, alas, Cesare Borgia. The Brera is
not open, and has not been yet, but the
'student' can always get in so we'll be
alright.

Your dandylion is covered with the dust of ages.   On Wednesday he went to St Bartholemew's and read the minutes of committee meetings in the 1730s and 40s.   I found one or two new facts and a date:   trivial but not hitherto used. Dandylion then had a good wash and went to the N.P.G today to read the vast correspondence of Nichols, the earliest writer on Hogarth.   Letters from 1780 to about 1830!   Not much there except a great deal of dust and one or two minute items.   Sir Henry Hake, however, came to see me as I worked and we had a long talk.   He gossiped about Beckett and Burke, both Hogarth scholars, and made a most valuable suggestion about Hogarth's linear theories.   Apparently it is a terrific privilege to get into the library there:   not even Beckett has seen the letters.

While I was at the NPG I looked at some of the poets and thought that they could easily be mistaken, Donne, Quarles, Sidney, Butler, four courtiers and all sorts of other occupations.   And then I thought how lucky I was to love a muse and a painter:

Your watercolours ravish me.  They are beside me now.  It is not enough to say thank you for them because one says that on so many occasions and this is so delightful a one.  To answer them I will say 'I love you'.  How different they are, the roses delicate and allusive, Fairlight impetuous and strong. I admire you as a painter, Sylvia.
What a pleasure to meet our rose again which I saw last at your throat.  What a daring composition it is: I do enjoy the placing of the vase and the way you have made the dazzling white paper express light.  The play of cut glass and reflected leaves is exquisite and the roses - how sensual.  The emphasis on the red of the dark rose is powerful and in itself beautifully painted.

Dearest Sylvia,

Thank you so much for my weekend. What a pleasure it is to see, hear, touch you and talk to you instead of thinking about you and writing. Your presence, your expressions and gestures, are so vivid and loving. I was pleased that you came to Hastings with me: my heart broke as the bus drew away and you vanished. Oh I love you Sylvia, without reservation I love you.

As we said I would I wrote a poem in the train which I have just revised. It is called AT HASTINGS:

Leaving the promenade and the flat
Horizon-hugging sea
Fraying into a surf of seagulls
We turned inland to shops
Laden with tables mirrors chairs
Staffordshire gentlemen
And cups fluted like a ram's horn
Remark, a chiffonier,
A [unclear]Bewick[/unclear] book, a pepper pot,
A classical landscape - 
Painted blue upon a plate -
Where lovers edge round lakes
Spanned by perilous slanted planks.
These tempt, these take the eye.

The poet looking at houses - 
Wishing for a painter's eloquence -
Looks hastily for words
To catch the cadence of perspective,
A three-storeyed bow
Elegant as the upraised arm
Of Madame Moitessier,
The scooped shell of a white porch,
And frames his pleasure at
Each linear verandah.
Fanlights radiate like fonts
Or ferns above the well worn doors
Of terraces that own
Allegiance to a reasoned past
And to this wilder time.
In the foreground my vivid muse
Commends topography.

Now I must away to town but I shall write again this evening. I love you, dearest,
I love you - Lawrence",0,FALSE

(The horn of the unicorn is an antidote to all poisons:  thus, the unicorns were able to keep the pools at which the beasts drank safe.)

Conceive a tapestry
Woven by love to show
A Princess and a unicorn
Beside a cloudy pool.

The smile of the Princess
Welcomes simplicity - 
Reflected in the pool
Spares the white beast his task.

So love must learn to banish
All hesitations from
The living pool
And like a unicorn dispel
The dragon's bane
That drugs our confidence.

AND A COUPLET - 

Sylvia is elegant and gifted,
She can purr like a cat and paint like a Princess.

Dearest Syliva,

I have read your letter several times and thought about it all through breakfast. I remember you told me several times over the weekend that I was a reasonable creature but so, triumphantly your letter reveals, are you. Yes I accept the position you outline if it is necessary to you: for myself I am entirely confident. But I know what you are giving up to come to me whereas I leave nothing pleasant. I know you love me, you have proved this darling, so do not fear for our life together. I would ask one thing - that our arrangements assume permanence and not simply a kind of experiment with the arrangements to be decided later. Provided we get on you can simply stay with me. We shall learn, as the lovers in Les Jeux Sont Fait did not, that our allegiance is to each other.

I imagine our life like two pictures by David. There is the double portrait of the Lavoisiers, collaborating on their mutual interests, thoughtful and polite, and the Paris and Helen, a similar composition but with sexual tenderness the theme. The two taken together make an admirable synthesis.

Poor Mr Handley seems to be at the stage I was at last year when I wrote my autumn poem. I fear it is too late for him to find his way out, however, as I was able to by following a lantern held by Cupid which led to - Sylvia.

I do hope that you have not spoilt your picture of Michael. Today it is bright so perhaps you can correct it. How dark it has been as you say. In the B.M. it is like an Elsheimer - the chiaroscuro of the dome broken with tiny lonely reading lamps.

Thank you for working my lantern so well. I mean, of course, at the lecture but I seem inadvertently to have picked up the lantern held by Cupid again. This betrayal, however, is charming. Oh Sylvia I adore you. 

I long to speak to you tomorrow - that is Thursday. Give Tiny my love. I love you and long for the New Year. 

I love you,

To show the matching picture, the design
Continued round the camber of the urn,
The abstract pattern or hand-painted vine.

This trail of roses leads beyond our sight
But we need fear no autumn and no break:
The lovers on the swing are answered quite 
By their doubles lounging by a lake.

Or dancing figures dancing in a ring
Around a classic urn delight the mind
With flawless continuity but bring
More to the eyes than eyes at first can bind.

The future is a vase that we shall turn
To find and flowers and dances going on.

Dearest Sylvia,

You are always in my mind and heart, vivid, tender, witty, loving, sustaining my great desire for you. I love you so much and wish for our being together so strongly:

Ardent for your presence
In the house of love
I ruefully distract
Myself with pleasantries,
Attend an archers' match
In a green alley -
But find the arrows are
Directed at my heart;
Observe the lore of the clouds
But draw no consolation
From the seraphic show -
As downy as a bed.
These and every other thing
Are symbols of my love.

This morning I finished another chapter - it has taken less than a week - so you see I am working for our Italian visit. The thought of you inspires me even as it rouses a desire not to be satisfied until the new year. I do little but write, either to you, or, about you, or for you (Hogarth). Have no doubts for the future: my dowry is not only three-penny pieces, it is love and care.

You are beautiful my dearest: memory places you in a landscape of wishing wells and mirrors. The wells will satisfy only one wish. But the mirrors compete for the most delightful image of you: all images are different yet equally lovely. But nothing can replace, for me, the exquisite immediacy of being with you. I long for you.

Thank you for your letter, it made me happy. Write soon please. You have not been unwell with your cold have you? It is a fine day today: I hope you take a pleasant walk.

The Muses were challenged by nine mortal girls to a singing match: the challengers were defeated and turned into magpies. This poem may seem arrogant, turning other poets into magpies, but only because they lack the privilege of your inspiration:

Let all the rest be magpies -
Gawky in the sky, or in the orchard
Peck unripe banks of fruit,
Jump, neurotic, at the scarecrow critic -

So, I, like Muses, banish
Competitors in song, for you possess
My poems like a wind the flag,
And lend them grace and wit, your merit theirs.

About ringing me. If you cannot ring me on Saturday afternoon perhaps you will ring me on Sunday morning? I imagine you
will travel Sat. morning and be at the 400 in the evening...
But I will stay in Saturday afternoon and if you cannot will
you be sure to ring me Sunday Morning? I will be free to see
you if there should be an opportunity. I long to hear you again.
I hope it will be a call-box or a private phone if possible. Oh

MARS AND VENUS

As amorini play
With the abandoned armour,
Experiment with echoes
In his helmet, piss
Upon the ornate shield,
Mars sleeps, forgetting wars
And dust and steel and blood,
In Venus' gentle couch.

It is the gift of love
That all who honour her
Experience content
In simple nudity,
Divest the fearful steel
Fit for the putti's games.

Darling I hope you are not upset too much by conflicts. I
am not too bad. I long for you passionately and earnestly.
I adore you.

The cool precise profile of Florentine
Ladies, does that suffice to catch your grace?
I think their elegance a shade acquired.

Or seen by Lely in Minervan dress,
Stern in a lorica Apollo gilds.
But what of flesh, impulsive not erudite?

Perhaps a Fragonard girl, amorous
Upon a tousled bed, delicate, plump.
Charming but not, no, not, a perfect likeness.

In a landscape peopled by Venetians,
Water and music blended, I approach
More nearly to your double, but my Muse",0,FALSE

I think so often of your pictures, especially those of yourself. But no, everything you do is precious and compelling. Sylvia, my darling, I love you.

I have been to the Danish Exhibition again and do not like it nearly so much this time. Last night I went to a lecture at the Institut Francais on Poussin's Predecessors and apparently the wife of Jacob Bunel, a 17th century Frenchman, was a talented and remarkable painter. Madame Lamy did not give any slides of her, however, but I thought you might like to know about her. The lecturer was a woman too.

Good heavens it is nearly half-past eleven. I have to go to town and work. Alas.  I would rather stay here and write to you. Dearest Sylvia, I love you, I long to hear you on the phone shortly. I hope your journey here is pleasant.

AN ANNIVERSARY

Oh, in that January,
The frosted peak of brown
Despairing Winter
When the orchard was bony,
Love made a tapestry
Of crimson weave, depicting
Our bodies and the god -
Symbol of our discovery:
We turned the head of Janus
And where a frozen mask
Had been Apollo was,
Warm and victorious.
And as the month returns
His gold thread brighter burns.

Dearest Sylvia,

Thank you darling for a charming letter which turned my head with pleasure. I am happy that you liked our poems and chapter. To think of you is to think poetically. Here are a pair of poems for you dearest Sylvia. The second one takes a conceit of Donne's (Busie olde foole, Unrulie Sunne) and turns it round.

Nocturne

Pale blue stars ambush my sight:
Victorious ephemera
Of shooting stars traverse
The sky between our houses
On this cold winter night.

Oh for our hands to witness
The testament of love
With you on such a night
That I may be at last
Love's willing Sisyphus.

Aubade

Each tousled nude complains
At the intruding light, and of the need
To work the orchard or the fields
And leave from love for daylit hours.",0,FALSE

Do not abuse Apollo so,
Gold in the dare of morning,
The forest fire, the lantern,
Because his warmth and energy
Is love's prime symbol not his enemy.

   George III had a Bridge made in one
night so that when his lady woke in the
morning, at Kew it was, she would see
this unexpected addition to the view.
It spanned a lake. This morning I
have written the following poem for you:

We knew the lawns of love,
Suave turf compiling vistas
Between the formal groves,
The wilderness, the knot,
The parterre and the arch.

But love worked in the night
And made a classic bridge
linking the island and the lawn
Above the waterlilies,
Above the twinkling fins.

We cross a bridge my darling
Our hearts made in a night:
We were the architects
And putti laid each stone.

   I am happy you are painting well and
I am most excited at the thought of a 
self-portrait. It will be difficult I
imagine but you will do it beautifully.

PASSIONATE PAVANNE

Such music, near at hand,
Wakes the sleeper,
Sends the hunter for his bow,
Ship-wrecks the cartographer.

It is a beating heart
Sounding in the red caves
Of the body like a drum

A lyre accompanies
As when the wind
Draws his fingers through your hair.

PERTAINING TO CLOUDS

The clouds, victims of wind
And of enquiring wits
Who catch the fluent world
With nets of transference,

Divulge the news of love.
For who, the lover asks,
Could miss the heraldry
Of images on vair?

Scarves by the hand of Paris,
Galleries of arms,
Owls and cornucopia,
And sunsets like a swan.

SONG

I wake at seven, see
Holly nodding in the breeze
You wake at eight, remark
How still the orchard is.

You eat white bread, I brown,
I eat at ten, at nine
You settle in your chair
And look into the cup.

At noon maybe we share
Authentic souvenirs
Or in the well of sleep
Obey a single oracle.

Sorry. I wrote a letter to you on Monday but failed to post it. Part of my Christmas Protest, I suppose. Anyway I expect you will have heard from Toynbee by now. I had a note from the Registrar in which he said he was hoping to fix up a meeting with you. Major Ellis, remember, is the highest-up, but Vanstone is the vigorous organiser with his finger on the pulse of the Common Heart. Do ring me if I've neglected anything you want to know.

Fostered by absence,

A locked-up world, but melts

Dearest Sylvia,
At last the time approaches when our
love can be expressed without the pain
and frustration of separation and though
I know the difficulty you must be feeling I promise you everything that love
can do. How wonderful it will be to
meet you and not have the Southern Railway, a sinister and threatening perspective in the background. To talk to you
and not fear for the night when you will
be gone. Your love is heroic because
you are leaving much that you love. I
know this and I will keep you safe as
well as adore you.
Tomorrow is an anniversary of my visit to Pett, the first and the fifty-
third. Oh dearest I love you more than
I ever believed possible in those early
days. Do you remember how, in the summer, you said that our love had flowered mutually like two roses together.
That poignant and lovely image is always
in my thoughts - as often as you are and
that, need I say it, is always. This
New Year will begin our life together
as the last New Year saw our love begin.
Thank you for your loving letters which
make me happy and seem to me a prelude
of such happiness and love.",0,FALSE

It is good news about Jane, too.  I hope things will be easier for her now.

A few minutes are left before I go to the Library and get the Barber Institute address.  That is why I have time to add this before racing to the post at four o'clock.

What about your painting?  Have you had time to do anymore to your laughing selfportrait or to the landscape from your window?  Send me what news you have, dearest.

Dearest Sylvia,

       You sounded unhappy on the phone and I cannot blame you for I know that leaving Michael will cause you pain. But the fact that you are strong enough to make this decision shows that you know the other side of the picture - the side which shows our love. This decision, despite your allegiance to Michael, is a passionate testament of your love which I treasure even as I feel for your pain. I wish that I could help you now but as soon as we are together I will be able to.  Do you remember our talk in Camber Castle with its plan shaped like a clover? There we were confident and happy. Once we are together all the things that seem to wedge us apart will act differently, like a net of Vulcan pressing us closer. Time and Space will be no longer hostile - but attentive as putti to our requirements! But most important is the simple fact of love - expressed in action and speech and feeling - not in clumsily selected words and guarded telephone talks and fragments ripped from the calendar. Our love is strong and it moves against the schizophrenic personality of our time : our needs and their expression are one - we fulfil each other. Is this not so?",0,FALSE

My first poems for you were rather staccato and then they became more confident.  But all of them are the size of lyrics or sonnets, as if mirroring the nervous, broken rhythm of our meetings, the alternation of love, and solitude.  But now I shall write for my lady something long, elaborate, complete.  My Lady as Muse.  Not a watercolour but an oil.  You inspired in me the idea of a long poem by your lengthy work on our double portrait, improving it infallibly with each addition.  I want to produce the poetic equivalent of your picture.  Its greater security of structure than my other poems will mirror our love.

I will write again tomorrow.

Dearest Sylvia,
I want to send you hastily these poems so that they arrive before you leave.

Painting and Poetry
Are sisters, Dryden said:
In pictures you shall see
The image you have read.

Then poetry may dare
To be your counterpart:
O may my poems share
The beauty of your art.

Blackberry leaves, exquisite
As signals to the butterfly:
And roses in cut-glass
Give to blood a petalled form.

These flowers that you paint
Curve with the line  of life,
Creative, warm, - like roses
Answering Orpheus.

iii
The figure of a lady standing
Beside an easel, palette in her hand,
With neo-classic draperies stirred
By an inventive wind, her brushes
Held as lightly as a fan at dances:
She is the muse of painting, or she was.

But I have seen a painter, sitting
Before her easel, sometimes spilling
The turpentine or working days upon
Imperfect forms until they please,
Wearing a sweater and a skirt.
And she too has a garland in her hair.

The first stanza of the third poem describes a Muse from a late 18th century engraving.

I long to see you on Wednesday, dearest.  Tickets, times, accommodation at Bilston, visit to the Barber Institute, are now fixed.  My thoughts are with you all the while.

Oh my Dearest, writing to you again after being with you is a poor substitute. The pain of your leaving at Victoria was dulled by incredulity that in a few minutes you would not really be there. Your beauty, your vivid gestures, your speech, your love, fill my imagination like roses.

I do hope that your journey to Hastings was comfortable. Did you see the sunset which reminded me of the 'gate of living pearl'? Once at Pett I cannot express how strongly I will for the minimum pain for yourself and Michael - even as you leave him. My thoughts are with you all the time and when you think of me you can be sure that I am writing for or about you or preparing for our future.

I am so sorry for the discomforts of our stay at Mrs Clewitt's and I am distressed when I think of your being unwell and yet journeying about with me in the cold. I treasure your courage even as I am sad at the need for it. How Happy I was during our ten days in the Black Country - despite the difficulties. Being with you is a wonderful experience after so many glimpses and separations. You are in my mind now - not merely a life-accepting figure, but a life-welcoming one. Thank you so much for accompanying me to the Midlands and here words sound flat so I hope that my love thanked you.

This morning I went to Blackheath: it took just under 25 minutes by train from Charing Cross and just under 10 minutes to walk from the station to 109, Blackheath Park. The walk is along a charming road, lined with trees and all kinds of houses, many of them pleasant Victorian and late Georgian ones. I saw our room and decided to take it: it is separated from the house and we shall have to cross a small courtyard to get to the main building where a large 'lounge' with many armchairs is available to us at any time. The house is Victorian and not too tastefully furnished: long windows however and a cast-iron verandah. Our room is smallish, with two windows, double bed, hot and cold water in the room, gas-fire, wardrobe with mirror on it, arm chair, &c. Here is a rough sketch of it. On the next page. The ceiling is not high. Thinking in terms of weeks we will probably be there in about 6 or 7 weeks. Mrs Gardiner may be able to put us in the house later on if you like. It is on the first floor and we go up a flight of stairs to it. I had a look at Blackheath afterwards, though casually, and it seemed nice, quite pretty, a sort of Hampstead. Blackheath and our road is very quiet. I looked at 107 where our flat is to be and its situation is very nice, overlooking a wide view. I told our landlady - who seems to be pleasant though 'genteel', and not fussy or neurotic - I would come in in about a week and that you would be arriving in about two weeks.

Dearest, dearest Sylvia,

Thank you for your letter which made me happy this morning. Your feelings in the train were rather mine too and the next week is for me a blank, tense interim. I hope you have thought over the Blackheath room described in my letter and will accept it till mid-March. I hope you will be able to talk to Michael without too much distress. I know you will not delay this time, my dearest, and I promise you love, happiness, artistic creation. Alas, that you are tired. I hope you are fit again now. I am alright.

I have a lecture at the N.G. Thursday morning and I think it is this Friday that I go to a village near Tunbridge Wells for Skipp to talk about French drawings. Today I have some reviews to do: the D.B. Wyndham Lewis book is really quite good. I think you would like some of the Pompadour tributes. My course at Banstead will start on the 21st. It sounds easy and no preparation is really needed. Minimum rate is 25s. but I may get a little more. Anyway it is that much more a week so useful. I act for you, darling, in every poem, firstly in every poem, and in every article and lecture too.

What magnificent eyes you have - eloquent and subtle. I keep thinking of you in your hood, the blue lining under the fur edge glimpsed round your face - how accomplished and easy you looked. And in your blue dress - at dinner and by the great fire at the Star and Garter - well, you know how you ravish me in that. (I hope your shoes are comfortable.)

The Wright and Lambert photographs have come and the one for us of Dovedale is superb. Robert Hart is going to lend me Antal's Florentine book so that will be interesting to us both I think.

You asked for news of my poems but pleasantly our letters crossed so you have most of the news already. Good news in-deed about the Greenwood prize. The riming poem you alone have I'm afraid in your notebook but I will decipher it if you will bring that small notebook when you come.

Lunch is nearly ready so I must close this letter now.

Look after yourself my rose, sleep well, do not worry too much if you can help it, and remember our love can overcome guilt.

I love you, I love you,
I am so happy you have enjoyed re-reading my poems. I will write again quickly - I love you

Dearest Sylvia,

I am delighted with the pull-over. Would you please
thank Tiny very much and also the lady who knitted it.
And thank you very much for it was your idea - and the 
colour is just right, and I adore the pattern and think
it will keep me warm, dearest. I am going to wear it
today and shall feel very smart. You can see in one of 
the drawings Dandylion trying it on with one of his bows
(I hope you can see which one despite the inadequacies
of his old paint-box.) Also you can see him wearing it
on a visit to Charles I's statue at Charing Cross with 
the white owl, though this is poetic licence because he
really went early in the week. The third drawing, by
the way, shows Dandylion carrying Antal's Florentine
book, puffing slightly. . .

The White Owl wonders if with the remaining ounce of
wool the work-party would make him a pullover to match
mine. . .

The soap was very thoughtful and I am sure it will
keep us polished and spotless for a long time. The
Owls think the smell very nice and so do I.

'Near Tunbridge' by the way is quite wrong. Skipp's
secretary was misleading. The place is Crayford, to-
wards Dartford. The Banstead course is 'Appreciation
of Painting' so I can mainly use my Toynbee lectures again.

I am glad about your watercolour - I was confident
that you could complete it alright.

Dearest Sylvia,
I am sorry that our talk this morning was intense but your letter was more discouraging perhaps than you realised.
I implore you not to delay - it simply prolongs the conflict you are suffering, upsets me, and postpones out happiness. 
Do not revive the red-herring of security for you know I can give you that - and love as well for which security is a substitute.  But, of course, your feeling for Michael is the real difficulty; instead of enlarging the obstacle by staying where you are will you not leave him quickly. Give our chance of happiness and mutual love the first place. You say Michael may have changed: I doubt it but if he had would it cancel our love? Or your need for mine - as mine for yours.
We have already compromised with the three-month period suggested. Do not whittle away any more from our love. I passionately and painfully sympathise with your conflict, believe me dearest, but the only way I can help is to be with you and not by waiting, waiting, waiting.
I love you utterly, Sylvia.

Dearest Sylvia,

We said on the phone that 'heads' were working against your heart at Pett. Thinking it was over I am not
so sure. I think reason is on our side as well as pas-
sion. f you were not to come now doubt and frustration
would cling forever to what remained of our love. It is
I think reasonable to come to me for three months. If  
compromises are to be made they ought to come after that - 
not before. I want the change to make you happy, free
ENTIRELY from Michael, and the associations of Pett, Tiny's
projected guilt, and so on. I know it will be difficult for Michael but it was difficult for you for a long
time. You say in your letter he can't understand 'why
I should leave him'. Good Heavens, what more does he
have to do to you? I should have thought he had done 
more than enough against you and against Eros.

If you will come I ask one more thing. Do not, if
you can help it, come with the mental reservation of 
a compromise being reached soon. Try wholeheartedly
for not less than three-months to be with me. Please,
do this, dearest. I love you so deeply. Come to 
Blackheath and come soon.

Dearest Sylvia,

I hope that you caught the train or that, if you did miss it, you caught a bus easily at the other end.

I was sad when I got back without you but I set to work and this morning completed my Ben and Frances review. Also my Observer reviews, at last. By working hard I shall keep going until you come again!

Last night I started the Epithalamium, writing 72 lines straight off. Lots of work still to be done, of course, but it is a start. It is the direct result of your visit, inspiring me, literally as a Muse does, and I only hope that the music and the images are not too unfaithful to your beauty and the longing you rouse in me. I will send you passages soon.

     I cannot write as much as I would like now for I have not had lunch yet and I have to get my lecture ready with a few notes.

Dearest Sylvia,

    Thank you so much for your letter.  Thank you too for your kind enquiries about last night:  the lecture went quite well and the people seem to be interested.  I am getting out of one Monday night by taking them to the N.C. one day.  Next week - Art and Society.  Then Materials of the Artist.  Audience is bourgeois, and moyen-ages (!).

    I agree with you about the flat in Aberdeen House and though I shall look round the antique shops I shall wait till you come more determinedly than ever, my darling, my expert.  I should like to give a Regency character to the room.

    I have read four chapters of Raphael and intend in the course of today to read as much as I can of the remaining 300 pages.  It is really rather pretentious:  sublime and Germanic.  However, I am learning things from it inevitably and my review shall be objective I think rather than infectious.  We must go through the plates together when I've read the text.

    The Greenwoods would get no prize from me but, obviously you will have to delay for them.  I hope to see you then on the 14th or 15th.

    I did send all the postcards and I will tell you my phone number, too, in case LEE Green 0263.

    Here is the poem I read you:  PASTORAL

Dearest Sylvia,
Rest assured I will be discreet and I do hope that you 
will not add to your anxieties by such fears. Your suggestion about Skipp is one I had already reached. Have
no worry here and ascribe to Dandylion the courteous im-
pregnable reserve of the Cortegiano. 
I enclose two drawings - of masterpieces of Caroline
portraiture - a Dobson, in fine condition, and an unusual
Van Dyck. They are among the new exhibits at the Maritime
Museum. I looked in there yesterday when I went to change
my address on the ration book. (I find incidentally that
you can exist forever on emergency cards so that will help
you when you come here except for points which we can give
Mrs. Gardiner loose, I think.) But to return to the pictures -
they are magnificent and would, even in the N.G. be of
dazzling quality. I cannot wait for you to see them.
I have booked seats for Machiavelli's comedy at the 
Mercury for the 16th. I know nothing of the plot but I 
am sure it must be enchanting. Incidentally my father is
getting the Phaidon biography of Lucretia for me (trade price) - that
promises to be fascinating. With all its shortcomings,
and some of them are offensive, the Raphael is teaching me
a great deal. There are one or two Giorgione asides
which may interest you. While I study Roman you
are reading Venetian art: how I look forward to 
reading your article!
One can make one's own tea here so that is pleasantly
useful. Mrs. Gardiner's attitude is a reasonable one and
we seem to be getting on alright. I mean the afternoon
meal by 'tea' so it is cheap and fills in the gap. Dandy-
lion had two meat meals yesterday you will be glad to hear
and lots of tomatoes.
I hope you painted yesterday, and again today. Give
me all news. The two sections of our Epithalamion are
called The Wishes of the Bride and The Wishes of the Bride-
groom.
Would it be possible for you to lend me two clothing coupons? I have hardly any socks and could thus buy a stout
pair. I am sorry to ask you but I can repay you soon and
the need is urgent. Mother is very stern and won't part
with any more. I hope to buy a few cheaply soon.
Meanwhile...
I hope you are sleeping well; take care of yourself,
my dearest. I love you very much more than I can say in
words, in prose anyway. Sylvia, I love you,

Dearest Sylvia,

I am enchanted with news of your new painting - I am glad that you are working so well. It sounds a lovely thing - delicious thoughts of the colour come into my head as I write this. I am glad you think of your two drawings done here as studies for oils - the trees in the landscape in particular which you drew so well.

Ruskin complains of 'base Renaissance architects' who 'covered their work with comic masks and musical instruments'.

A silver comet stoops across the sky
And vanishes into a woman's dream
To dazzle there and function as a lamp,
Illuminate the grottos of sleep,
Colour the monochrome sea and flowers,
Behind her eyelids and defensive arms.

The stars make patterns, as of arms
Arranged in trophies up the wall of sky:
I like the other side of sleep
On the dark sub-conscious coast of Dream;
My wish rides on a falling star, a flower
Whose petals cross the shadows like a lamp.

O coral heroes, fishes bright as lamps
Inhabiting a sea of sleep where arms
Of divers grope for pearls in every flower,
O when they surface in the morning sky
Their hands divulge the perfume of a dream -
Accurate, innocent souvenir of sleep.

Under the waves of sheets you sleep:
Beyond the naked circle of your arms
Luminous vistas answer the lamp,
Mutable premises of dream
Where pearls can change to roses, and the sky
Distends with pollen for the sleeping flower.

Symbolic object of desire, the flower
I dream of burgeons also in your sleep,
So though we sleep apart, the sky
An iceberg in-between, reflects one lamp
Which we divide in dreams - the phallic arm
That reaches out to morning from the dream.

Apollo's comet in the sea of dreams
Was an imprudent coral flower
And now the sunlight lies upon your arms
Like petals of a rose, and sleep
Falls from your sleepy head. The lamp
Expands to fill the total dazzling sky.

Souvenir of sleep, Apollo's lamp,
Comet of flowers, blazons the future sky,
When you will test my arms, my love, my dream.

I have just had a lunchtime walk in the pleasant landscape outside the village, over towards Redbourne. It is a fresh, crisp, bright day and I enjoyed it very much though I couldn't help wishing that you were there with your watercolours. Then the experience would have been preserved...

I enclose a cutting from the Harpenden FREE PRESS and I need not tell you how annoyed I am on behalf of us both about the caption.

I hope that the situation is not too frightening though I can guess at your grief and feel something of your terrible perplexity.

No clear picture of the situation at Pett is contained in your letter except for occasional jagged notes of anxiety or sadness.  You ask for assurance of my love.  Here is a sonnet I have just written to ease your fear:

Even in the calenders of absence
That hang like curtains over words of love
We keep them busy whom Devine employed,
The loves attendant on the God of Love.

Putti who lately quarrelled for the roses
Made by our mouths compete for letters now
Oh make a mirror of my tears
And bear it to you with my image in it.

With wires they make a golden tyranny,
A net of memory to prison us,
Oh with their wings pillow the restless heads
of lovers sleeping disparate and strange.

Oh, in your absence love is not forgetful
And Putti sigh in hundreds as I wait.

Believe me, dearest love, I  adore you.  I cannot say too often that I love you nor can I adequately define how much I love you, Sylvia.",0,FALSE

Then I climbed up on the barrow and saw, in an adjoining field, a derelict tractor. I sat in the seat of it for some time and enjoyed the view and the warmth. I thought very poignantly of our country walls together.

The tie is a delight.  I was quite late to bed trying it on and admiring the resultant Dandylion in the mirror.  It fastens excellently and the colour is fine and strong.  When I consider that you wear the same material in your hat my pleasure is increased - so it is both delicious to look at and full of associations.  How resourceful of you to supply a clip also.

Several children have made this place a home from home & come in when they escape from school (disgracefully early) until bedtime (dangerously late). Last night after I had talked to them for about an hour I set them to counting up the warm and the cold pictures, the number of animals in the exhibition, and so on. After that they gave each other piggy backs until I said sternly they were to behave like their  grandparents & for about 3 minutes they crept about with open legs and bent double-silently. But only for 3 minutes. Soon I had to throw them out. They came back with promises of good behavior. One lay down on a bench and pretended to be dead for a long time: this was Janet who is about 5 and has a squint & thick glasses. The other 3 girls are about 5 or 6, also, and are animated, unwashed, with yellow teeth and lank dark brown hair. At last I got them interested in mythological animal & drew unicorns, griffins, sphinxes, and harpies for them. I did not tell them how to trap the unicorn and I kept back the chimera. The one who was dead finding herself ignored began to snore, turning a dangerous game into a milder one.
Harpenden's visitors were easier to write about than those at Redbourn who are more peasant like: if the former ones had middle-class absurdity and foolishness about them they had, too, a middle-class ability to express themselves that is not enjoyed by the ape-like visitors here.

Dearest Sylvia 
Thank you for your letter which crossed my worried one in the post. This morning I shall finish Mahon and get down to Hogarth again - so that we can afford Italy. I feel more confident now for my muse has given me a motive for working again.
I have a rather stuffy cold this morning which makes me breathe rather heavily but otherwise I'm alright.
Last night's lecture was enjoyable and I think a success: over30 people. I talked for 35-40 minutes and then we had about an hour's discussion.
Poor Sylvia, dearest pussy, how I feel for your indecision. I'm glad you are painting and reading, however, and, to judge from your words, painting well and frequently. You are a lesson to Dandylion as he is first to admit. I hope you are sleeping well, my darling.

be rather indifferent to the exhibition though the
publicity is so bad many don't know about it.
Sherwood was efficient in comparison with this!

I hope that the situation is not too frustrating
though I can guess at your grief and feel something
of your terrible perplexity.  But on the other hand

Dearest Sylvia,

Thank you for your letters. I am sorry to hear that you do not feel better yet. My poor, naughty darling. I shall set Yawolla onto you: he is as stern as Nurse See used to be about that kind of thing. Get better!

I agree with you about La Tour and I shall try and get the book. What a good idea! I don't much want to review Charles' book - it would be rather a responsibility, don't you agree.

What a good thing the table was still there. I was prevented from getting to the sale by an appointment in town but I shall look about elsewhere.

Good See - two watercolours finished. I think that is splendid. I don't know when Fame and Promise is but I'll find out some time. At the moment the Gallery is being painted and decorated.

I can see your tree painting now, on the table beside me, and it pleases me more and more: the design, the quality of light, are pure delight.

The R.S.A. sent me today a transcript of what I said in the Chirico discussion. They wanted my approval before it is printed in their journal. After I had asked my questions a porter gave me a form to fill in - name and address. I thought probably I was to be punished afterwards for criticizing the speaker but now I see why...

I hope your party with the Woods was nice. Do give them both my love. What a pity about Jane Brown. Was it not she who was Clifford's lover? Or have I the name wrong? I hope for Clifford's sake it's not the same girl.

Today I am going to town for tea to meet Paul and I think we are going to meet somebody afterwards: whether I am being shown to them or they to me I don't know. Tomorrow I intend to laze all day as I have been so busy for a week. I shall eat and read and probably not write at all.

I have finished your poem so it will only be a day late.

De Chirico is an odd man: polite, willing to smile, yet rather taciturn in a deep part of his mind, not on the surface. He has a dark olive complexion and a fine head of silver hair, flat on his head, and his nose is even longer than you think. I found it easy to reconcile his appearance now with the painter of the early works for there is, it seemed to me watching him fairly closely, a neurotic tendency to fidget interspersed with periods of majestic calm. He gives, mainly, an impression of detachment. It is easy to associate Romantic Anguish with him.

I am intrigued by the summer dresses you are preparing. The very old one which is in fashion again sounds a delight. As usual, of course, I feel I can't wait to see you in it.

What a good thing about Norman Haire and Clifford. I am pleased and it will encourage him very much I am quite sure. I looked for the new Sex Education in one or two shops but they only had the last number which Marjorie sent me. I shall get it soon though.

Dear love, dearest Sylvia,
You are, for me, absolutely inseparable from sunlight. I am sitting by the window to write this and the bright sun warms me and this sets my heart beating faster and my memory overflows with enchanting memories of you - all of them brought out, as it were, by the sun so intimately associated with you. Occasionally a great crystal drop falls past the window from the edge of the roof because it rained last night. Birds are hopping on the lawn, others are singing, and the cuckoo, though eloquent earlier on, is silent just now. A late 'cabbage white' fluttered zig zaggedly across the lawn just then.
I love you so much, my dearest, and desire so strongly to make you happy. I am so happy that Venus is giving me this chance - Venus, and the two muses - whom we each personify. I hope that you are painting on this nice day - I intend to do some of our",0,FALSE

Thank you for your letter:  I am so happy
that you feel my love during our absence.

Remember that it was Michael who first
introduced the question of separation.  If
he meant it or if he didn't it was not evi-
dence of love as I understand it.  Either
he meant it and was capable of leaving you
or, if he did not mean it, he was simply
using it as a weapon against you, something
to batter and torment you into 'faithfulness'.
He has said it, not once, but repeatedly.
However eloquent or desolate he is now do
remember the situation devolves from him
just as originally his attitude to you led
you to me.  He is the real enemy of love -
not you:  the complete reverse of a conventional judgement of the situation is, as you
know, as Clifford surely knows, the truth.

Charles was pleasant and I have bought ten thousand lire from him which is useful.

I am sorry for the confusion that resulted, if I
am not mistaken, in your receiving a letter intended
for the Barber Institute. Let me know if it was that
or a letter for Gibson I sent you so that I can send an
appropriate apology if one is due to anybody. Poor
old Dandylion, all this letter-writing is too much for
him! He has been busy this  morning and has now quite
finished his Gainsborough articles and intends to do a
short one on the Vienna Tapestries as well today.

Your registered letter came this morning. I will
go to London tomorrow and get the tea then. I will send off
the tea then or, if I am late, Saturday morning.
You should have it by Monday morning, anyway.

Yes, I will be delighted to meet you. Anywhere
you wish, at terminus, wayside halt, on the coast.
Anywhere. I await your next news.

Yesterday I had tea with Charles so that's over.
Then in the evening Paul and I went to see Nahum Tate's
adaptation of King Lear which is really admirable. For
the most part it can be taken quite seriously in its Dry-
denesque character. There is one funny bit, however, when 
Regan says to Edmund, after he has betrayed his father, 
and is simulating great grief:

There is a grotto in the lower grove
With privacy to suit a mourner's thoughts.

Charming is it not?

   Your letter came this morning.  Thank you for it,

to have guessed I would, I looked at your pictures
last night with rare pleasure.  I will extend
the catalogue entry a little:  No 21 - self portrait

perhaps.  I hope two more Pett landscapes will 
be added shortly.

your letter to work especially well.  How thought-
ful you are - mention of our glimpse of marriage
a la mode brightened my senses this morning and
certainly enabled me to work better.  I feel a
bit exhausted but it is honorable labour and 
so feel slightly complacent.

Retract allegiance to the day  -

In the garden like stone beaux.

Of action, order, and discretion,

Conduct imagination
To vague allusive pastorals

Over softly passing boats
And slow motion festivals
Lull your sense with monochrome:
Penny theatres of the ballet
Dancing on your oblivious comb.

To poet or the under-twelve,
Inflames with cold or jumps spreadeagled
A silver phoenix from the dark
Bower of ashes in the garden:
The satellite is ambivalent,
Like a lake or like a mirror,.
Does it show the last Narcissus
Or lovers' curiosity?
Luna duality is ours:
Constant, paradoxical.

And a SONG:

No necrophiliac neophyte,
Flagellant or snake-charmer,
No skull and bone collector, I,
Yet centered on the wit of death:

No motto on the portland urn,
Beneath the sinister ivy,
Computes the death I long for
In the soft, deep urn of flesh.

On head-surmounted pagan terms
Of Pallas and Apollon
I languish in reluctant life
The pauvre undying lover.

It describes a Dutch version of Autumn as a Personage:

Geography imposes form  
On local habits of imagination:
And climate models the moustache
Or dykes the character of boats.
Autumn, the Boor, stands tall
Above the flat horizon
Holding a barrel to his lips
Above his comrade-belly.
No Bacchus, here, not buttocks stained
With purple like a woman's chin.
Provincial, wide, and popular
The personage September
Adopts the local character
And belches like the thunder.

Dearest Sylvia,

Your letter did not come first post and I have only now, in the afternoon received it.

I am so distressed to hear that you are suffering from insomnia. my poor dear creature, I fear 
that your sleepless periods are worrying as well
as tiring.

Your lion has a bed in which he hopes you might
be able to sleep better and would love you to
sleep there on Saturday. (Saturday is better for
me than Thursday because I have appointments both
Thursday and Friday and I have kept the week-end 
free in case you came.) My first impulse was to
see you at the earliest possible moment, of course,
but Saturday is the actual day in any case.

However, if you are still in a very nervous
state would you prefer not to travel? I long to 
see you, again, but if you think the journey would 
disturb you in your present state I will wait until the following Thursday to see you.

I hope, my wonderful love, that you health
permits you to travel but if it should not I will
understand. The health giving properties of lions 
is well-known and, perhaps, D[unclear]a[/unclear]ndy could be prevailed upon to lecture for hours about Hogarth so
that you would fall fast asleep. Seriously, my
love, allow your health to decide - that is most
important.

you every night as I have been doing and hope that 
you will rest. I love you. I love you,

King's College Chapel is now absolutely cleaned and I managed, for the first time, to see Wren's Pembroke Chapel. We saw Waltham Cross on the way.

Congratulations on starting the Dutch painters. The job is a great bore, I know, but the money will be useful.

I was amused with Ted: he told Paul that he (Ted) was very pleased with my hair that time (which I illustrated in a vignette). I have been there since then and, again, with the most satisfactory results. Ted seems to know what to do now.

Chronos, plucking hairs and sowing
Forebodings of the rotting future,
Games of absence, overpowering choice,
Old beard and bones, the dog of clocks?
Or the naked agile boy,
Hair flopping on his forehead
For virile hands to catch and render
Wishes into form and action?

Because my love has caught his lock
The former version stayed away
On my anniversary.
For as long as she stays here
Opportunity is ours
And abundant satisfactions:
But when she leaves me both are haunted
By Renaissance, not classic, Time.
The fear of time is her companion
And I must search for the illusive boy.

And another one, the one I promised you yesterday, which
I felt you inspiring while we were together:

By elemental cold and heaviness,

But in the dew upon your lips and those
Transparent globes that linger in the groves
Under your upstretched arms, the element
Of fire or altitude would be a plant:
No, like a traveller happy at the sight

Your pearls and dew are my cases.
The blood is like the fire, but in its course
Moves like a river in the living map,
Tribal and vivid feeds each shape,
In breasts and lips, in parted thighs.

Like ripeness from a fruit another liquid
Ferments into the wine of the id
Whose gift is freedom from gravity
(Like that of swimmers in a rolling sea):
The wine glass and the vase are both full-filled.

The flower in the feminine vase
Waters itself and the cup of flesh:
From these liquids we distill
Love potions to inflame us still.
Each time we love we mix the next embrace.

The image of the 'transparent globes' is one that has been in mind since you told me of that cavalier poem with the sweat-pearls image.  I think we could call this poem In Defence of Water.

    In the seven days till I see you again I am going to work hard.  I am going now to town to spend an afternoon in the B?M.  print room - looking at prints in which The Analysis of Beauty is criticised.  Then tomorrow I can start a new chapter, dealing with the last works - including Virtue in Danger and Sigismunda.  You are and will be as I work in my mind all the time.

I have not started a new chapter but finished the one
I was working on and revised a chapter written some time
ago. I find I was wrong on an important point so I have
to recast a section of The Two Progresses. I shall try
and finish it today - if my lecture permits, as I think
it will. I think I shall be charming and stimulating (!)
rather than erudite and instructive.

Last night I went with Paul to coffee with Edward
Roberts. Some other people were there including a man
from Blackheath who is very knowledgable about the theatre: he was able to clarify the problem I was working on
in the Hogarth chapter. I had tea after I left the B.M.
with Joanna Tucker, a friend of Molly's whom I hadn't
seen since I left Wimbledon. I met her quite by chance.

Copping was admirable, much better than any of us expected, and the discussion, though not precise or lucid,
was extremely interesting to any social psychologists who
were present and to me. I enjoyed myself very much. I
hope Clifford and Marjorie did - I think so. Aren't they nice.
I was very firm about the Ballet Negre.

I hope you will bring back the Venus - there seems to
be no reason to leave it at Pett. I am delighted, indeed, no 
that is too mild, ravished by, Apollo and Minerva.

Yes, do try and see the Walters on Tuesday afternoon -
that is a very good idea. Then we shall be free. I
wondered if you would like to go to Oxford one day: I
ought to see the Hogarth oil sketches there. We will
see how much time we have for your painting which must come
first.

I am, now, surrounded  by your paintings and some watercolors and, my dearest, the pleasure they give is immense,
aesthetically and personally. I adore you.

I leave the decision about the mirror absolutely to
you because you are on the spot and, also, because your",0,FALSE

taste is worth more than anything I can say. If we should have it, do get it. If you are not satisfied, let us wait. I shall be happy either way for I am sure you will decide rightly.
I hope you were able to get Modern Painters at such a reasonable price as you hoped?
Your fears about the results of the pound devaluation are rather generalized: France at least is still easily accessible. Italy is down 600 lira, as far as we are concerned. I am delighted that England is producing her own wines - it seems to be the only thing that is plentiful, judging from a list of vegetable crops in The Times. Your account of picking the wild vines was charming and made me long for you.
It is raining, softly, steadily. My hair will be quite destroyed - and be shapeless for days. I shall not go to Ted until nearer your visit, however. I am resolved to wait.
I have got a book of poems by Wright's friend Hayley which contains a long poem about Painting and Painters and an Ode to Mr. Wright. I look forward to collaborating with you so much. I still remember how brilliant were your judgments and comments at the Derby Art Gallery. 
I am charmed by a choice of word at the end of your second letter - you say you look forward to 'hearing' my chapters. I am so pleased you chose that word and did not say 'reading'.
I love you: I miss you very much and long for Tuesday. My rose, my dove, I love you. Tell me you love me, I love you. Lawrence

Dearest Sylvia:
Two letters came this morning, much to my delight.
I am glad about the Kensington Gallery:  what reasonable terms, much better than the Portrait Society.
Greenwich measures 24x18ins.

I hope to see you on the 25th.  Come in any case on that day if there is a sale or not:  I long to see you, as you can imagine.

Alas, the wind last night blew the smaller begonia off the window ledge.  I have brought the others 
in but I am not sure if I can save the fallen one
or not.  I have replanted it and I will tell you
how it looks in my next letter.

Tell Tiny that Hetty is only too happy to shop, especially for materials!  I shall wear some of the
finery I have on in the portrait she likes.

My unwell feeling has quite gone:  I think I had
drunk something which disagreed with me but which
felt terribly like a prelude to 'flu.

I am very amused at the two reviews of the Salesman
Named Desire or Death of a Streetcar, whichever it
is.  I know you have the Mirror, sharing it with 
the Woods, but how did you come by the Times?  The
Times review seems to have been written by a woman - 
don't you think?

I fear you would be blown quite away today if the 
weather at Hastings is like the weather here so no

Please, do not think Watkins is a favourite poet of mine. Not so. The Shell is the first poem I have liked for some years; his norm is regressive religious stuff, not unlike the last act of The Bar Within Love.

This afternoon I must pick up my washing, see John Skipp and give him the just-this-moment completed draft of the exhibition and, finally, meet Paul at six in the bar where we met him.

I saw John McHale and we wonder if it might not be possible to start a magazine next year. He is going to see if the D'Arbeloff's would not finance it.  It is of course, very vague but the possibility is exciting. I have heard from Ann and Natalie and they have had food poisoning, unfortunately, but seem better again now.

Sunday
Dearest Sylvia,
I have been re-reading your letters - the ones you have sent during the past two weeks, that is - and how charmingly your personality and love are expressed in your pages. It has made me agreeably nostalgic and I shall dally, all day, with thoughts of you in the past and anticipations of our renewed meeting this week. I had thought to hear this morning: if you have not written by the time you get this letter on Tuesday morning would you send me a wire? I think we are to meet in a day or two and long to know when. You said in your letter that if you did not come on the 25th it would only mean the delay of a day. Does that mean I am to see you the day after tomorrow?

I hope your painting of Tiny is satisfactory: have you nearly finished it? Will you be able to bring it with you for the exhibition? Your lion looks forward very much to seeing it - and its painter.

I love you. I think of you elegantly lazy in the bath or sternly busy at your easel, working hard just as the light starts to go. I remember how warm you were in bed after I had got out, put the kettle on, and got back in bed: it was wonderful.

Today I have a N.G. school lecture on Impressionists and another on Wednesday afternoon. That is all for this week.

Let me, my dove, know soon.
Your easel will be ready on Wednesday and I want to know how much shopping to do.

On Saturday evening, after I had just returned from Birmingham I went to see Love's Labours Lost. It is an exquisite play, absolutely at one with my taste for pastoral poetry and for erudite imagery. I know this is your taste, too, so I hope that we can go together shortly. You will, I know, adore it as much as I do and I long to see it again--and especially with you.

Apart from a circular letter to Mesens, Erika, Colin Agnew, Smart, Gainsborough, and brief notes to the New Statesmen, Art News, The Times, and International Journal of Psychoanalysis I have told no-one about Michael's projected relations with the Lefevre. You will, of course, have already seen my communications to The Daily Express and Old Balls' Almanac on the subject so, tell Michael, I say nothing of these. And, of course, I [unclear]rary[/unclear] James and Longden immediately but I know he couldn't mind that.

I wrote six letters on Sunday of a dutiful kind and today I am going to see about ringing up editors and go to Christies (two guineas this will produce). Tiny tells me you are busy making dresses. I look forward with great excitement (and Hetty rather ambivalently in case she look too shabby by contrast) to seeing you in them. Oh Sylvia, I adore you. I hope that you can feel and believe in my love at this distance. I think from your letters that  you do. I adore you my ravishing beauty and Muse, my rose and my lover.

On Friday morning I went to the New Statesman offices
and saw Janet Adam Smith. She gave me the new Hogarth
book (the one I bought a few days previously - you may
remember it) to review and is going to send me Beckett's
two volume catalogue of Hogarth's paintings when the review copies arrive. She wants me to review the two
works: she stressed that this was rather in the nature
of a test review to see what my work was like but that
they would use me if they liked it. She thinks I might
also do short reviews of art exhibitions and wants me to 
send her some of my notices from Art News and Review.
She was charming and friendly though, you may remember,
her letter was not encouraging. I am glad to have the
Beckett book in any case - as you can imagine ...

Then, on the same morning, I went to the Times Literary Supplement (I was wearing my suit and duffle coat)
and saw Allan Pryce-Jones. He was charming and gay -
he sat on his chair behind a vast desk with his arms
folded round his knees which were pulled up to his chest -
and promised to send me some art of literary books to 
review. He seemed confident of using me as a reviewer.
He said he could help with other introductions, to the
Observer of Spectator, when I told him I hoped to make
a living by writing.

You are kind in your concern for me but I see from
your letters that you need my concern also: with two
lectures on one day and entertaining at the weekend!
Do not, my rare beauty, exquisite rose, tire yourself.
Rest on Tuesday as indolently as I am doing today: I
don't think I shall even do any Hogarth! Have all your
meals with Tiny that day, and do not work at all. I
recommend this passionately.

The last Banstead lecture was yesterday and they want

Just as I had written that page a discreet tap called me to the door. It was Williams from downstairs with a registered packet for me which he had signed for when I was out. I had been about to say, alas, the ring, despite the good news in your letter, had not yet come, but now, I can say that I am typing, now, with it on and it is superb. Oh, Sylvia, my darling, it is beautiful and I am so happy. How beautifully is it carved and how well have 'Gunkel and Humperdinck' made the setting. It is just the right size, comfortable, neither too tight nor too loose. Oh I am ravished by your gift which shall be our emblem, for it is your image on my hand. Thank you, my love, more than I can possibly say. Your design is so suitable, just the right blend of masculinity and grace. Lionel is eulogising on it even now and Hetty has fainted with pleasure. Yawolla is awestruck and for the moment, silent, gazing at it. You can picture, I am sure, Dandylion's pride and delight: he stops typing every few words and turns his hand into many positions, fascinated by each different view and eager, too, to recapture the angle at which he had it the second before.

Albert seems to be very well and he has brought his mistress here, a pleasant American girl, extroverted and cheerful, who is studying music. I saw them yesterday morning before John McHale and I had to leave in order to go to the Annual General meeting of A.I.A. I had to leave before the end because of my lecture at four but John McHale was going to propose me and Gerald Marks second me for the central Committee. I imagine it went through but I shall not know for a day or so. I tried to ring Marks last night but could not get through and, today, I am not going further than the pillar-box.

Dearest, my dearest Sylvia,
What a beautiful and happy metaphor have you placed at the close of your last letter and, perfect though it is, the long poem which seems to take its origin from your phrases, claims to be written; I mean your likening of your pictures to 'coloured fruits' nourished by my sun.  You are yourself a poet for what a significant and lovely image it is - a crystalisation of one aspect of our love.

Alas, the landscape is not conspicuously pastoral, in an agreeable sense, but all too naturalistic.  My journey here was through a winter world delicately and unevenly patterned with snow: the fall had not been heavy and nowhere was the snow thick - green fans opening under every tree or bush.  From Redcor to Middlesborough one traverses an incredible industrial landscape in which depression and disgust are less marked, [unclear]in[/unclear] one observes, than an instinctive sense of wonder at this tangle of little railway lines, fabulous architecture, and great plateaus of rubble or twisted masses of dead stuff suggesting a landscape on the moon.

My [unclear]nose blue[/unclear] in the cause of culture I located , as perfectly as I
could from memory, Girtin's viewpoint of the cathedral and then
crossed the river and entered the cathedral itself.  I spent about an
hour and a half there and came away, only then, reluctantly.  How [unclear]bustless[/unclear] were many of the details of the early English additions
(or 'editions' as the guidebook called them) beyond the high altars - how, if I may say so and, candidly, no other word will do, how,  
after the solemn harmonious Romanesque with its perfectly dis-
tributed accents of pattern or oh so economical grotesque, how 
Victorian.  The Galilee chapel, however, was enchanting.  But it
is on the Romanesque that I lingered, remembering
our admiration for the Italian version of the style.  I think that
the heaviness of the Romanesque has been exaggerated, just as the
'verticality' of the Gothic has been caricatured.

   I will write again tomorrow, my darling, for I must now start
the journey back to [unclear]Redear[/unclear], where I shall be in good time for dinner I
trust.

   I wish so much, so very much, you could have been here with
me; then my happiness would have been insurpassable and my
pleasure in and grasp of the cathedral increased by your
knowledge.

   And now I must rush.

Dearest Sylvia,

Monday morning has brought no news, as yet, of the exhibition, but it has brought what I so much more desired, a letter from you.

I am glad your lecture was better attended, a marked rise in numbers.  Probably had it gone on a bit numbers would have further increased.  The fact attendance recovered seems to give the lie to the canon blaming you for the attendance.  He sounds a vile creature - vile.  When I reached the point in your letter when the [unclear]epidiascope[/unclear] burst into flames I laughed and laughed - it had the cumulative comic effect of one of Sir Osbert's stories about the cavalry.  (I have almost finished Great Morning.)  When Mrs [unclear]Woorbouse[/unclear] brought in my eggs and bacon I was still chuckling away, madly, to myself.

Yes, I think Yorkshire good-will is a well-founded myth (though, of course, library staff must be excluded from any generalisations - leaving as they do in an introverted philistine world of their own).  I meant to remark in earlier letters but seem always to have suppressed it that the people, apart from my hosts who are exemplary, all seem amiable, not afraid of smiling - as great a contrast as I could wish to the people in the midlands.

[unclear]Melty[/unclear] has showered questions on me about the exact appearance of your new coat but I tell her she must wait and see.",0,FALSE

Yesterday, somewhere in the neighbourhood of Southbank,
between Redcar and Middlesboro', I saw that one of the steel works  has a
distinguished monument - a vast pylon of glittering steel, 
supporting a disproportionately small box with a clock in it, and,
at the base of the pylon, a suit of armour.  Behind it, beyond the
high wire fence, the usual industrial ruin stretches away -
with mushrooms of orange fire leaping up every now and again
and a patina of soot that gives everything (except the monument)
that 'before cleaning' look.
I find my attention often wandering, just now, to the
possibility of writing a prose-work, other than critical, I 
mean.  Every now and again in letters to you I find I venture
on experimental descriptive passages and my reading of Henry
James, at St Albans, remained in my mind to be [unclear]fired [/unclear]by Sir
Osbert's ravishing complicated prose-style.
I adore you my beautiful lover and long to see you
again - Although it is such a little time since we were together I long to see you again, and am most impatient.

Tuesday
Dearest Sylvia
Here is your poem - your enquiry about it in this morning's letter stimulated me to do something about it.  Yesterday - and still today - I have been bored and dilatory.  No doubt about it, I am a gregarious & extroverted person - needing intellectual or gay conversation.  An introvert might be happy here - but not me.  I was creative when I came here, witness the poem, which I hope pleases you, but the environment has put an end to that.  Even my pleasure in reading has slackened as a result of surfeit or, perhaps, as Mrs Moorlane sympathetically suggested, 'too much reading - that's bad for the head'.

And others straddled goats and pissed upon

Those amorists whom genital desire

Dearest, my very dearest, Sylvia,
I hope that your journey back Is comfortable and that you enjoy seeing the Woods again (as I'm sure you will) as much as they will enjoy you, my darling, my beauty.  How fortunate they are this Christmas to have your beauty to delight and charm them, your wit to stimulate and please them, and your intelligence to inform and, occasionally I am sure, agreeably disconcert them.  I shall think of you in such terms all Christmas, my rose, adding all the associations and lyricism which it is the essential fortune of a lover above everybody else to know about his beloved.

Forgive me for not phoning this morning for - despite my inclination - I felt it was necessary to get on with a Hogarth chapter.  I believe that you will forgive me when I tell you that I have today (it is now 3.15 in the afternoon) written no less than half a chapter, a feat which surprises me  a little.  As I did no work yesterday and spent it happily with you this labour was essential.  In the next two days I can finish this chapter and, all being well, and I intend that all shall be well in this matter, start another.  It is something of a pleasure to be working again after a break.

The sun has been bright today as I worked and it made me think of you and of the poem your lovely image suggested.  Soon, soon I shall write it: your coloured fruit are about me on the walls of our room.  Do not, my love, feel sad about the situation with Michael, at least, more sad than close association",0,FALSE

I received a charming letter from Clifford this morning in which I shall certainly save for you to read as it will amuse you very much.

Did you go by Poynings on your way to Pett. I suppose not but I was wondering if you had seen Yawolla as I have not yet heard from him. I hope this is the turn on the tide in Y's fortunes.

In my next letter I shall be able to tell you something about the A.I.A committee meeting I shall attend in a couple of hours. I do not expect to obtain immediate results but I hope that this will be a step towards, in the future, hanging pictures by you here.

I love you so much, my beautiful, ravishing Minerva (how you have inspired my critic's pen today) and feel you with me which makes me happy. The variety and high quality of your pictures inspires me as well as giving me a great pleasure in themselves: I have just noticed a felicitous passage in the Pett Level oil which I had not seen before. and this morning, when I woke, admiring beams of sunlight opened a slit in the curtains and illuminated Venus so that I was literally dazzled by her as I so often am dazzled by you.

Thank you for your second letter which I received last night when I returned from a pleasant evening with Paul. His shoes are admirable: no news about the revue yet, it is today he is having lunch with the people connected with it. Yes, do let's go to Mrs Toft on the 8th February, before a Banstead lecture.

I bought Rewald's History of Impressionism yesterday so I have plenty of facts and dates about the artists for this evening's lecture. It will help me, too, to make my N.G. lecture formidable on Saturday. This morning I have read two more chapters of The Picturesque and have now accumulated seven pages of notes on the subject. It is fascinating.

To morrow before going I shall do some work on (a) picturesque, (b) impressionists, and (c) psycho-analysing Hogarth. After such various study I shall probably seem a lion with three heads:

Alas, no letter from you this morning and your
last letter on Saturday, though charming and most
pleasing, was terribly short.  Do write at greater
length - please, my rose.

I can catch the 2.30 post with this letter.  I am
reading Clifford's books and making 'vast' notes.
When I have finished this letter I shall continue

Molly and Eric came yesterday and Paul (Southey)
came to dinner on Saturday :  he liked the Lion at

You relied too much on my charm I'm afraid for
I was unable to get you any tea with the loose coupon.  The spirited girl we used to know at the Kardomah has gone.  I am so sorry.

How are you?  You tell me nothing of yourself
in your letters and though lions like love letters
more than news they do like to know how cats are.
Otherwise they worry.

Saturday's lecture was, I think, a success :  there
were at least 180 people.  At the end of Miss Mountcey-
Wood (spelling?) appeared and a charming American.  I
had to choose between them :  I choose the former, be-
cause of pity, but, really she seems much worse.  Communication is almost impossible with her now.  I might
as well have talked with the American.

Tomorrow I have a N.G. lecture and then on Wednes-

'The Herm' is increasingly attractive and I look at it daily with greater pride and pleasure than ever. Do tell me, precisely, what canvases you want, beside the 24x20. Then I can get them this week. In town if necessary.

lectures and must leave home soon.  Also I want to revise
the Approach to Art one a little as I had a letter this
morning saying Anthony Hinton, assistant regional director
of the London Arts Council would be coming to the Woman's
Institute.  I don't know if this is a routine matter or
if they are wondering if, now John is going, I am suitable
for the Arts Council.  We'll see.

Yesterday I managed to get to the Redfern Gallery and
see a new painter, Swiss, whom I met there, called Rolf
Durig.  He is quite good.  I have sent off, terribly
rushed, a review to Gainsborough this morning.

I met Roland - of R, Browse, and Delbanco, yesterday - 
and he said he hoped to come along to the discussion about
landscape, French or English, at the AI.A.  He introduced
the subject I was pleased to note.

have to use books which is a wretched nuisance, as I shall

    In your last letter I was charmed by your description 
of being 'very busy'.  In the morning you had painted
Tiny - in the afternoon you 'sat'.  It conveys a feeling of domestic and artistic calm to me - certainly in 
contrast to my day yesterday.
     I got very wet several times.  After the W.I. lecture which was successful despite some bad organizing
of the epidiascope so we could only see half a picture
at a time I went to Sutton.  First I tried the library:
it was cold.  So I went to the pictures and saw the
end of a western in which three people were shot:  I 
know who did the killings but not why.  Then I saw
half of another film in which three people were stabbed,
and here I can guess the motive but do not know who.
    The evening lecture was good, I believe:  neo-impressionism, symbolism, and, finally, Cézanne.  Despite 
the dreadful weather everybody was there - more than on /
the first night. /
     I am delighted to hear of the jug - and long to see 
it, and the cups.  I hope they will not complicate the 
problem of packing unduly.  'Antiques' unfortunately 
cannot get any more of that nice French material to cover in the fireplace:  I wish I had better news of that /
to answer your exciting acquisitions.

Dearest Sylvia,
What a delightful letter is your latest. I was still moving about sleepily this morning when I opened it and your words galvanised me into being awake and renewed the conviction that I love you passionately.
With your letter came one from Schmanski who is going to use The Third Man, definitely, in World Review, the next number.
The discussion last night was amusing and I think to an objective observer Westbrook and I won: the voting, however, was level. Graham Reynolds of the V and A spoke after Westbrook so my main task was to attack Reynolds, which I did vigorously, showing up the romantic-emotive fragments arguments he was forced to use to support the English. Arising out of the meeting I think I have made a very important contact for the future- I will tell you about it when you come, it is most exciting.

Our theory and our mood? Remember, some
Supposed it was a phallic crest surviving
Elaborate sunken continents, 
Precipitous and guilty as a gibbet
Caked with snow and with the wind raked.
Blue noses not red lips and bones not breasts
Spiky, not voluptuous on the shore
Where dribbled or beat the sea, in mad extremes.

Some wish it free of love's longer words, 
Its lees peaceful because free of verbs,
A concave in the sea, an azure dent
Out of the wind, and well off the trade routes
Where captains keep their logs and sailors spit,
Responsible or merely animal:
Under the raft of the horizon,
The island slips, regressive involute,
Diminishing in vacant fathoms

Has cliffs, but functional, set for a climb,
Is tranquil, but not past the point of choice.

Rise tumescent from the blossom,

Between retreat and death the island is
A purple bed- an orchard
Replenished by the latitude of wishes.

Dearest Sylvia,

How are you, my lover, my beauty, on the first day of the month that is the first month of Spring?

I have been working and now I can relax and write to you before setting off to Banstead.

My new chapter has reached about 5,000 words which is, perhaps, half-way. So you can see it is double the length of the other chapters. I am pleased with my discoveries and long to impart them to you.

Tonight at Banstead the subject is Expressionism and very conveniently there has been a small but thorough expressionist show at S. George's gallery. I shall not have a meeting there next Wednesday as you come on that day. This Saturday I must take them to the Tate...

Yesterday's lecture to the photographers was much better than the one you heard
(Brueghel, el Greco, Velasquez) and they",0,FALSE
11344919,gri_2003_m_46_b03_f03_003.jpg,"were friendly and asked questions and I was
in better form. The next lecture to this
group was due for the 14th but that is the
day of [unclear]Mmy[/unclear] Hogarth lecture at Tunbridge Wells.
So I rang Clare and exchanged lectures with 
him: he's doing the photographers on the
14th, I on the 7th, thus leaving me free
for Tunbridge Wells.

Charles has given me two school lectures
tomorrow, at 10 and 1.45, to a youthful
boys school. Isn't he nice? And
some others, including a public one on a 
Saturday at end of the month.

I am sorry this is so dry a letter but
I thought the information in it might be
reassuring. There's some more to come.

John left the Arts Council yesterday but Miss Chick is
taking over the draft of the exhibition
so I expect to get my money soon as she is
more business-like than John. And the
NS and N say there should be some books in
for me next week.

Dearest Sylvia,
I can't think what you are doing applying for the job at Durham. Have you thought what our position would be like if you got it? Can you be so irresponsible? When should we meet? Certainly you would be able to keep Michael financially but you would hardly retain my love if you sacrificed me to that end. I feel depressed and hurt that you consider such a course. You cannot place this importance on money before love, surely; if Michael would only get a job instead of farting about the problem would be less acute. What you have told me about love and proved in your actions shows up the real value of this wretched lecturing post. You suggest I apply: I won't for the reasons that I wish you hadn't. I hope it is only as the result of pressure from M that you take this step. You cannot want it to happen. Our meetings would be far between and haunted.
I am sorry to write so but what you suggest seems to me to run counter to the reality of love, the reality-principle of love.
Yesterday Charles took us all in a ride in his car: we went to Eltham, hoping to see the palace, but it is only open on Thursdays. It is on rather dilapidated crown lands. He took a wide route coming back, through Woolwich and other places like that which are vile in their stifling urban appearance. Blackheath, I realize it increasingly, is happily situated, neither too far our nor near in.
Jaspers is an existentialist philosopher - hence the contrast with Dandy which obtains even today when he is a bit saddened.

I long to see you because I love you, you make me happy, and I will make you happy, too.

Tuesday

Dearest Sylvia

I hope you are well and strong.  Your letters shame mine on
this occasion.  I shall try and make it up a little in this
one

Fancy your reading the Cocktail Party so quickly and so very
promptly.  I do not think the most modern cat could do more.
How dare you complain in future of being out-of-touch or not
up-to-date.  Must you read it, again?  That seems very determined of you.

After reading some Joyce I want to ring some changes on the
title of TSE's play: for example, The Cocktail Poortea, or
Kicktail Plenty, or Cookedall Partings.

Joyce review goes, I am sorry to say, very slowly: I am still
blundering about with numerous fragments I have written.
It is not yet a coherent review.  I have found it very hard to
concentrate: I have, to use your phrase, 'contemplated' Hogarth, but that is all.  It is a slack uncreative lion at
the moment.  However, here are two poems, though I am not
confident of them:

All sugar of a smile
The window of desire
Open to vivid carpets
Of flowered odalisques

All sugar in a mouth
My vivid feline city
Where spoons of clock towers taste
The pleasures of a room

All sugar of the night
Stars scattered through trees
My overdressed nude
Discard your habits of fear.

No, I revoke my judgement above.  Typing this poem, written a
day or two ago, I am quite pleased with it.  Here is the other:

The rhetoric of waterfalls and empires,
Elaborate as Bacchus' Indian sunrise,
Large statements of the weather and of progress,
Loving repetition of heraldic certainties,
Obscure the shades of meaning indirection.",0,FALSE
11344940,gri_2003_m_46_b03_f03_017.jpg,"II
Leafingered balances
Of pollen spooned by wind
Blue highlights in a flint
And mirrorevading favours
Of a dual mood

Heroic reminiscences of sculpture 
Whisper allusively
Rhetoris has its state and its authority
Soft, in the yielding cage of dawn 

The latter, you will see, is a 'duel' statement of rhetoric,  which I ironically defended and the less 'official' attitude which you maintained. Both-and, of course, is my out.

Paul read some of my poems and liked them, especially some of the Still-lifes.

Thinking of Paul reminds me that he has some gossip. Ricky has not painted a thing for weeks and Molly has been afflicted with boredom (the enemy is ennui).

I met Klingender yesterday and we had a pleasant talk. I shall see him again at Madeleine Pearson's party.  We disagreed, politely but firmly, about the French abstractionists included in the London-Paris show at the New Burlington. It's all a great bore, English and French alike.

Oh dear the time is 12,45 and soon I must go to the N.G. for a lecture to the photographers. I think it's the last one, I hope it is. I may go on to the V and A for some slides for the last Banstead lecture tomorrow. I have so many things to be doing I feel a bit paralysed: Joyce, Hogarth, pictures for Miss Chick, letters, lectures, lantern slides, and I want to do some more to our play, but how, when? I will try.

Tell Tiny I have a Sewanee subscription for the coming year already but that I shall be delighted to lend each issue to her as it appears. Does she want some more yet?

I am looking forward to easter with you. I shall get lots of chocolate eggs. And I believe I can now cook omelettes: this will be a new distraction for you.

I think of you all the time and, now and again, with a shade of apprehension for every time you come to let the flat there seems to be a crisis. I hope it can be avoided this time. For, my dove, your sake, as well as our double sake. I love you and long to be splashed a bit with your paint again as sometimes happens.  Particularly with red.

My role is a modest one: that of footnote. I t falls to me to confirm what you already suspect. The symbols, though chosen with modern liberality, support a single plan. The river by which our gifts were conveyed is that which runs between Blackheath and Pett – and with which you are personally familiar. But water is not only a means of transport, it is an emblem of love and art, as it leaps like Hippocrene and runs into the sea which is might be said to fertilise. (I admit the conceit.) The river carries your Birthday Masque and is, also, a metaphor of reconciliation, as between male and female. The transition to another, lighter element is meant to symbolise erotic sensations and, at the same time, bring us back, in a circle, to the river again for Hippocrene, though it arises in the earth, is nourished by the beneficence of Cloud-carried Goddesses, such as yourself. And now if you will mount the cloud.

Through the bridges of the day.

You shall race your lion home,
Conveyed by air leave him behind
And as he nears the inland source 
Shall find the rising current stronger,
And wonder at the power
Until he realizes

Of the unchanged bearded anchors.

Where ferns fold over the parted banks, like lapels,

Thank you for your two letters. One I received last night, the other this morning. You see, I did go to Brighton after all, first spending the night of Saturday with Molly & Eric, and so your letter did not reach until my return. I hasten to answer it before you leave Bath.
Your account of Chicester cathedral, where I have been twice, but not recently enough to have a good memory of it, stimulated me to add almost 50 more lines to my typographical poem. The Countess of Arundel I particularly mention but the whole section about church visiting followed the communication of my Muse. I will not send it to you, yet, much as I am tempted to do so, but prefer you to see the whole poem when it is complete. (Apart from this poem I am working on The Poet in the Garden, along question and answer poem (100 lines), a journey based on the fare-stages of a bus ticket, and plan today to start a group of lyrics about women with double-heads and '[unclear]profullface[/unclear]' faces.)
On Friday I talked about near Mannerists & mannerism: Piero's (?) Florentine General, two del Sartos, the new Bronzino, two Moronis, Iatto's Lucretia, and Sebastiano del Piombo: it was successful, I believe, and certainly covered an unfamiliar sequence of pictures. I thought of you so hard, so sweetly.
I thought of you, again, at Brighton. Ilsa Rodmell is a sophisticated, primitive painter working now on charming Campigli - [unclear]douanier[/unclear] Rous-seau type pictures. Bernard and I were both impressed. She is very gay, CIRCA 50, and lives, incidentally in pretty Russell Square. She has a 26 year-old lover who is really a superb painter, John Catt (so there are two painting cats connected with Brighton), an expressionist, as neurotic as they come, but very gifted. So we had a pictorial treat for Ilsa & he seemed to have hundred of pictures each to show us.

Your recent letters are beside me and my only disappointment is that you have not yet sent the second owl-wedding drawing that you promised days and days ago.  But, still, the one I have is so pretty: I especially admire the difference in build and proportion between the male and the female owl.  You have exactly caught them.

Peter Raven was under my arm this morning as I walked towards the stations and met, guess who. Peter Raven.  I greeted him - but sternly.  He was clearly a little abashed, remembering that he had defaulted.  I entered him for The Observer exhibition this morning.

On Monday I will collect your pictures from the Kensington Gallery for you said, I see, after re-reading your letters, that 5th June was the day set by Mrs Marchant.  Your lion-manager thinks he has somewhere else to show them.  There is to be an exhibition in the foyer of a small theatre somewhere, the details of which I can get on Tuesday.  If it sounds safe and satisfactory perhaps you would not mind lending them?  What do you think?  It could do no harm.  In any case there is no hurry for a week or two. 

I saw Ceri Richards at the Redfern this morning (Miller was not there as far as I could see) and agree with you.  The picture in the case outside is a full pastiche of HM.  Some of the large pieces are exciting, strong, and bold but there is a rather forced feeling about juxtaposing Matisse colour with his own odd figure formulae.",0,FALSE

I am looking forward very much to seeing the Berthe Morisot exhibition with you and I think Kenwood might be a nice outing too. However, I do want you to paint, provided you feel like painting, and I think it is more important for you to produce your pictures than to look at other people's (Kenwood will always be there after all). I am sure Berthe will be very stimulating, however, and I have deliberately refrained from going though I have been in the neighbourhood so we can share it more fully.

I went to Kenwood with Robert. Workmen are still there but it is delightful. Many Reynolds I am glad to say and a Gainsborough which will, I am sure, take away my cat's breath. Pretty garden and grounds also!

Owing to my lateness in answering a telegram from Charles I missed a lecture at the N.G. this afternoon. He was very sorry but had had to ask Mrs. King. I listened to a part of it on Claude and Poussin: it was so tatty and muddled and banal.

Banstead have asked me officially to lecture again in the autumn but no news from Toynbee yet.

Write soon my dearest creature and tell me that you love me. This afternoon I was turning over a book and came across an 18th century view of the Villa D'Este and I was deluged, overpowered with memories of you in Italy. I do so love you, my beauty, my rose, my Minerva. I shall no more be cross. I am consumed by regret for my past bad spirits and shall atone by eleventh century adoration when we meet again.

Dearest Sylvia,

My previous letter to you was very short I'm afraid but I shall make this letter more adequate.  It is Saturday evening: I have eaten my meat ration, among much else, and pause from critical writing to put down what has been in my mind all day - I love you.  I have quite enjoyed this day at home, after a very busy Friday, and look forward to two more days at Blackheath.  I miss you but I miss no one else and do not feel impelled to ring anybody up, as I used to.  Today I have completed [unclear]Gilpin[/unclear], the [unclear]marisot[/unclear] note (which I enclose in its complete form), and added your observation about Sigismondo as a sequel to the Lady's Last Stake to the psychoanalytical chapter.  I look forward to another day's work tomorrow.

However, all this is about me.  I hasten to say how glad I am that you have bought your canvas and I look forward very much to news of its progress - from priming onwards.  Omit no stage in its creation, my beauty.  I think it is a very good idea to continue with the subject despite the setback about the church.  I withdraw my suggestion that you paint something classical for clearly that would be a silly compromise with your ideas for the large work.  So I await with great curiosity and excitement more news of this ambitious project.

I wonder what has happened about Clifford's interview at Oxford.  Do tell me as soon as you know.  I was glad to hear he was cheerful on Thursday evening.  You must have returned in time to outweigh Grace's telephone calls.  Good cat - I'm very pleased.

I am glad the only too well named Savages are good for something.  (I sound like you talking about Peter Simmons!)  I am sure that you will do a satisfactory portrait for them because they are fond of you and seem appreciative.  Your muse commends the commission and will do his best to make all go smoothly, even at long distance.",0,TRUE

I am so excited by your letter. My first impulse was to write a letter there and then but I decided to finish typing the Analysis of Beauty chapter. This I have done and now hasten to write to you about your pictures. I think the two landscapes look from your vivid, lively sketches, very good indeed. The spaciousness of 'my' view from the church, with all those interesting architectural objects, is just the subject for you with your gift of creating spaciousness without suppressing individual detail. The view of the garden with its obliquely viewed ground plane, as you look down from the bank, and the circular rhythm of the composition round the flower-bed is, again, exactly the kind of subject you invest with personal feeling and formal discovery. your drawings are very clear and a great pleasure to a lion who cannot expect to see the pictures themselves for some time. The clarity and definition of these sketches show that you know exactly what you wish to do-that your (pre-conscious) mind is made up-a state which always produces admirable work. Oh dear, I hope that does not sound like Dandy the lecturer. I am so happy, my masterful painter, that you are working so well and that, in addition to these landscapes you have prepared the flight canvas. Superb. As the weather today is very wet-I expect it extends to Pett-will you start work on it, or on 'Frankie', the subject you reserved for 'a dull afternoon'? because unless you more fortunate than I this counts as a dull afternoon. Tell Clifford that I am delighted but not in the least surprised by his success at Oxford. I look forward to fuller details.",0,FALSE

Forgive my not writing yesterday.  I had hoped to and carried writing materials about in my briefcase but apart from two lectures I had to review the Walton, see my father, visit a photographers about the Chick exhibition, and go to the bank, and
pick up Paul's hold all, and quite literally I had not a moment.
I'm so sorry.  I shall send off today the tea, return the ration books, and post the Eagle and Hillyard. 
Thank you for your latest delightful letter, which contains
such good news about your paintings.  The garden landscape al-
most finished -  I am astounded at your vigour.  Congratulations.
I hope the weather will permit you to finish 'my' view soon.
Yes, to answer your letter, I think I have solved D.O.A.
I got up early yesterday and finished typing it before break-
fast in case anybody in France is interested in it.  I won't
paraphrase my argument but show you the whole article when I
come.  Orphée?  I'd love to write on it but I must see it
again.
I met Gainsborough accidentally yesterday and told him to keep
me in mind when he starts covering films in Art News.  I told
him about The Third Man.  Talking of Gainsborough reminds me I
have just finished the Walton review (it is 10.00) and must be
off shortly to do the last-minute shopping and be at the gallery
by 3.00 for my Titian lecture.  The Walton show is a delight
but I did not meet anybody there.  I must certainly write about
Walton in book ii. 
There are so many things I would like to write about at length
but I really feel somewhat anxious about getting everything 
done today so forgive me, my darling, if I stop now, so soon
in this letter, but at my back I hear ...   I will write you at
length and lovingly from France.   I shall write you at stages
all along the journey tomorrow and remember when we made the
journey last year.  I am sure to write some poems.  Do paint
my rose, my so gifted painter, my love, my Muse, and tell me
all about your pictures.  I cannot tell you how happy your 
successful work makes me.   I love you, love you, love you, 
and will write amply tomorrow.

Dearest Sylvia,
   Delightful as Paris is I wish I were not here alone, and wish you were with me.  Having been here three days I feel so strongly what I said in another letter, that time is working now to reunite us.  Opportunity is in a street, a square, a gallery, in Paris, his forelock ready to be grasped & he will return me to you.
   Yesterday I went again to the Orangerie and made many notes.  This afternoon I am visiting again the Albertina collection, which gives me, to think of it now, a pang for we saw it together in England.
   Peter and I met two intelligent American girls - both of whom have been students of Kahoecha & one of whom attended the lectures of Panofsky later reprinted in Etudies la Iconology.  She says he is a rather heavy man with a small, smart beard, a painted one.
   Peter lives, by the way, in the district behind the Pantheon slightly beyond the student section in a rather residential bourgeois neighbourhood.  His apartment is in a large block as usual, & he has the same worries about [unclear]service [/unclear]he had in English blocks.
   If I may judge from the weather here you may well be able to paint your landscape from the church.  I do hope so.  It is warm but not, yet, stuffy, conditions I hope are shared by Pett.  You are, of course, still at Ditchley.  How dull.  Your return today will I am sure enable you to paint.  I am gathering images for my poems which I will send you soon.  My muse has given me images but not as yet the final guiding principle.

Dearest Sylvia,
       
        Thank you so much for your letter this morning. I am most 
disturbed to hear that you are not well yet. I hope that you 
are managing to sleep fairly long hours. As you say, you will
surely be well this month.

       The flat is rather bare at present as I have taken down most
of your pictures: my parents are coming this evening, and Betty.
I have emptied the cupboard in the kitchen and, nearer the time
of their arrival, I shall put the large ones in there for the
evening. They will be unharmed for there is plenty of room.
I do like more than ever you Ajax and the Poet, seeing it again after a weekend away from it.

       I have been working on tomorrow's lecture, using Antal, making a lot of notes which I shall type out after this. I begin
to know a little about early florentine art, supplementing what
you have previously told me. I remember again, so vividly,
Spinello Aretino's superb frescoes in S.Miniato. Do you re-
member? I got some photographs while you painted Florence. 

Over the weekend Betty and I painted the bookshelves, three
coats, and I carried it home yesterday afternoon. It was a formidable journey but your lion won through. In my opinion it
looks quite pleasant beside the window with books in and the 
silver lustre sugar bowl and ideal servant Jug on it. If you
don't like it, however, we can easily get rid of it,when you come.

       The flowers are all doing well-I watered them immediately
on my return yesterday.

       Molly, Ricky, and Paul are all shockingly poor but otherwise
well. They may have to give up their flat in the near future.
Ricky has agreed to put in the shelves in the niche when we want
them and Paul has some prospect of selling some textile designs
but there is nothing at all definite.

       I have written a new 100 line poem which I am tinkering with
in any odd moments that I get.

     You are in my mind all the time and I wish I were free to write
you at the length Cupid and I wish. However that is not possible
today for, apart from the lecture, I must get a dinner for
four. Hetty is busy on it already and Dandy cannot leave her
too long in the kitchen. I think the symbolic red ribband on
the typewriter looks pretty. I love you, my darling cat, my
rose, my Minerva. Take care of yourself and do not overwork as
you are not fully well. I love you,

Dearest Sylvia, 
I am so glad that you are getting on with your view from the church-yard: you must be very relieved as it nears completion after quite a long time.

Your letter contains delightful observations of the country, though the actual import of your observations (autumn) is welcome to others than lions: however, I was delighted by your descriptions. You are my topographical cat.

Further, you seem to be picking things madly: I visualise you as Ceres, splashed somewhat with different colored juices at the centre of a yielding pyramid of fruit.

I still do not know about Brighton (I will this evening - one way or the other), but I do not think that I can come to visit you at Pett, much as I should like to. Sure, stay till the 19th anyway.

Today I have to see the photographs newly made for the exhibition, attend the opening of the Children's Art exhibition, and lecture at 5.00 on Veronese. I am an industrious lion today.

Dearest Sylvia,

Brighton: thoughts of you were strong in the geometrical streets and crescents and squares and in the pavilion. When I was on the front I visualized you in the same place in the past, a past from which I was absent. Apart from erotic imaginings of you in the places I was in I also saw the architecture with your eyes, and your taste, or as imperfectly as I have acquired appreciation of Regency design from your beautiful example. Past and present were tangled in my reactions. Apart from this compound of taste aroused by you and desire for you there were many strange contrasts. Ilsa Rodmell turns out to be closely reliant on the cards, fortune tellers, and sorcery generally (she is, nonetheless, a good painter): we had a seance which was a complex failure in every experiment, except that Bernard was half-hypnotized and remembered a childhood nightmare. She read the cards and told me about the two (and I quote) women in my life: 'yes, yes', I said, 'how did you know'. And the medium, who works on West Pier, in the day-time projected (sic) himself to finding out about me and found a dog (very strongly, he said, he got a dog). We slept in Catt's garrett (he is in Paris himself), the bed was uncomfortable and sordid but Catt's friend Victor, an ex-prisoner of war, now a farm worker, was charming and made us as comfortable as possible. I went to the art gallery as you recommended and admired, though hastily, the Willett collection of ceramics but spent most time in the picture gallery: yes, I remarked the 2 Luca Giordano oils, and saw the newly discovered Constable portrait, and admired once again the superb Florentine Rape of Helen which I feel convinced is by The Master of the Judgement of Paris, don't you think?

Don't worry about my birthday: it is not the 14th, it is the 17th. But since it is so dynamic in your memory I wish you would not worry about it. I enclose my new poem and have nearly finished another. I love you dearly,

Last night's talk was fairly successful I think and the discussion lasted 45
minutes. I am glad there is only one more lecture, tonight for, though I change
it about a bit, this repetition is somewhat boring when the audience (except 
at Whitby) is not stimulating.
Reading Antal I have discovered in his footnotes (those rich mines below
the landscape of his letter-press) various references to Giorgione, [unclear]Vasso[/unclear], [unclear]Dorri[/unclear], Ariosto, Venetian mannerism and baroque: nothing important
but useful remarks you may be interested in. Do you think M. would lend
me the Ganderzio Ferrari book for the duration of our next week together?
Thank M. for reminding me of Seaton Delaval, but it is not, in fact, near
Seaton Carew. The nearest I have been to Delaval is Newcastle (it's North of
Newcastle) when I was unfortunately short of time and it's a great many
miles from S. Carew, alas. I did see, however, the impressive ruins of
Whitby Abbey on the cliff above that over-rated medieval 'beauty-spot'.
Today is mild & windy & the waves are mounting high & dramatically
along the promenade. This will be my last letter from the North but let
me assure you I shall not stop thinking of you. I look forward with
happy anticipation to seeing you on Monday. I shall be at Blackheath
from about one o'clock onwards. What time shall I expect you?

11345166,gri_2003_m_46_b03_f10_030.jpg,"ON PAINTING OUT OF DOORS

A distant figure sitting in a grove or working on a grassy ridge always excites curiosity and conjecture. Is he some dull amateur artist who does not merit out attention or is he an unknown genius whose glorious transmutations of nature will greet our eyes with a shock of pleasure? Better still, perhaps he is an acknowledged genius - some famous R.A. or avant-garde painter whose presence will provide a fund of anecdotes with which to amuse our friends.
So the spectators bear down on their helpless quarry - chained to his easel. If he be in a leafy valley he may not be aware of their arrival, but if he be on a hillside or an open plain he will, no doubt, be aware of their coming, eagerly running, ambling amiably, or nonchalantly strolling in a patronizing manner towards him. 'We may as well look,' these latter seem to say, 'though it's probably an awful dawb'. Whereas the runners, before they had begun their race, probably called
to one another, ""Cor, let's have a look!'
Some artists seem to like such attention - even invite it. I have seen a cheerful dapper person, his easel set down in the middle of the Piazzetta di San Marco, controlling quite a good sized crowd with his masterly gestures, and well deliberated retreats the better to view his effects. Although he managed with remarkable skill to retain the necessary space around to allow
for movement and, even more important, to see his 'motif', he remained full of good-natured 'bonhomie'. ",0,FALSE

     Some painters are not as strong-minded and confident of their
performance as this and find onlookers an irritating distraction
with which they quite unable to cope. Such a one was Paul Cézanne.
In the country district of Provence where he lived and worked for
the greater part of his life, his audience was mainly little boys,
for their parents would have been working on the land, and there
were few bourgeois visitors to be met with on the dusty roads.
Unfortunately exasperation got the better of strategy and instead
of letting be and hoping for the boys' inevitable boredom and departure, Cézanne acted aggressively, thereby exposing himself to
a mobile counterattack in which, owing to his fixed position, he
lost every advantage.
     Painting out of doors can, on occasion, be an unmitigated
pleasure. Sitting in a green landscape in Summer weather before
a desired view, with a willing friend to read aloud, is one of my
chief delights. But the weather is fickle and seasons change
all too quickly so that those happy circumstances do not recur
as often as I would like. Frequently, too, the desired view
can only be obtained from a most uncomfortable place. Such
was my position when I decided to paint the Red Lion brewery before
its total demolition, on the Festival of Britain site. The
most satisfactory position for my purpose involved my standing on
the foot-way of Hungerford Bridge, towards the Charing Cross side.
Here and there in the ironwork balustrade there are little embrasures and in one of these I stood facing my 'motif', my paper block
balanced precariously on a rounded knob on the coping, my paint-

",0,FALSE
11345170,gri_2003_m_46_b03_f10_032.jpg,"PAINTING OUT OF DOORS III
box in one hand and my brush in the other. I painted as quickly as I was able, racing with time and the demolishers' picks, enveloped from time to time, as the steam trains passed, in smoke and smuts. Passers-by naturally paused to look, some silently and unobtrusively, others making comments to each other, or to me. The youthful part of the audience always seemed to be surprised and delighted at being able to recognise my subject. 
It was then, for the first time, that I began to ponder, and consider as an interesting problem, the thoughts and expectations of these on-lookers. More often than not they seem rather disappointed, which is certainly not surprising, particularly if the work is only just begun; but it does suggest that they were expecting something - that they had some preconscious idea of how the painting should look. I have tried to put myself in their place, to guess at what is expected. Is it a neat, easily recognisable reproduction of the Brewery, for example, or an enchanting vision of the building, burning and gleaming with colour and light, rising like a Venetian Palace from the glittering waters of the Thames?
The artistry and the technique of the painter should satisfactorily control and contain the main features and diversity of the scene, opening the spectators' eyes to things hitherto unobserved and unrealized. Thus the forces of wind and water, sun and earth, the elements enveloping landscape and architecture, the one-time gods of our ancestors, should be implicitly expressed and overcome by means of brush and paint and held on the canvas for our admiration. ",0,FALSE
11345172,gri_2003_m_46_b03_f10_033.jpg,"PAINTING OUT OF DOORS IV
I have heard of but one painting which was unanimously acclaimed at the time of its completion. That is Duccio's Ruccellai Madonna which was said to have been carried through the streets in triumph by the jubilant citizens of Florence in 1285, because for the first time a picture of the Madonna had been painted in a relatively naturalistic manner and representing a gracious and tender woman instead of the awe-inspiring and remote Queen of Heaven. This achievement seems to have coincided with a deep emotional need which, when it was unexpectedly gratified, produced an overwhelming demonstration of joy and enthusiasm.
Such displays seem to us, today, to have an endearing naivete, the spontaneous vivacity of a Golden Age. So that when people look over our shoulder, peering closely at our work, questioning us on our views of art, we should perhaps be patient and pleased at their interest, thinking that there may yet be another happy period when original works of art will arouse universal interest with which prices and wages are discussed today. Taste and reason may again combine to bring about a second Renaissance, when art shall be as necessary as bread and butter to our well-being.
Alas, such illusions are quickly dispelled, for passing a corner of Parliament Square in a 'bus one afternoon, I saw a number of people standing behind a low barricade, gazing in front of them with rapt attention, while busy crowds passed near them: they were watching labourers making a hole in the road.

Dearest Sylvia,
I hope your journey back was not too crowded:
the bus passed me after I left you and it did seem
fairly well occupied,  I was sorry to see.
I had a great wrestle at the V and A, almost
everything I wanted being out: but by 5.00 I had
got substitutes (including an American deceive-the-
eye still life) and raced to Ted's. There I had
the good fortune to find the enclosed coloured
photographs of Ludwig's palaces. Tawdry as are
the reproductions I think they give an idea of the
magnificence of the originals.
I saw The Dark Man: it was photographed, a good
deal of it, in Hastings and Camber castle figured in
the chase. The beach at Pett Level, with men working on the seawall in the background, provided the
best scene in the film. But I don't recommend it
to you topographically. Kansas Raiders, the supporting film, was among the most homosexual Westerns
I have seen since Red River. So the evening was not
wasted: not entirely, I keep telling myself.
Is it raining at Pett? It has just started here
(11.00): soon I must get ready to leave for Tunbridge Wells: I have prepared the lecture before
writing this. Last time you were there: I wish
you would be this time, my love.
How excellent is your new double portrait. I
do congratulate you. I know Paul will, too. I
do love you, my dearest one: my mind and heart are
full of you as I write. I love you, I treasure
you.

I am very amused indeed that M is in bed with a cold. He is undoubtedly a character from Russian fiction. I am so sad that you, however, should be wasted on such a creature. Oh my dearest, remember to evaluate your-self highly, despite your company. Still, i know Clifford & Marjorie will keep your spirits, and your Renaissance view of man, up.

duction on the walls of their house, forced me to talk
about each one, and at midnight started producing
stuff from the attic. Among this stuff was a life size
Victorian portrait, embroidered: this they called a
'monstrosity.' It was mid-century and charming. My
mounting aggression took the form of a defence of this charming piece. When I left this morning it
had been restored to the walls, in fact in a conspicuous place that I chose for it, with the light falling
in accordance with the simulated shadows of the frame.

as you know, I find intolerable - to spend a weekend there, any weekend. I pretended I have their address. I have not.",0,FALSE

Impudent putti come and go like clouds
So that the sun, or a ring in your hand,
Is hidden and revealed by turns, a ball
Crossing the net across the court, a net
Which is the folding drapery of love -
The brilliant boy, the pupil of the sun.

Astronomers of love we know the sun
At solstice and at dawn and know the clouds
Shapeless and shapely semblances of love:
There is a sail for Cythere, two right hands,
The bed of Cupid and his silver net,
And moving all, like dancers at a ball.

The wanton master, cheeks plumped like a ball,
Agile and erudite, is Venus' son
Who orders (like a tapestry) the net
That captivates his patrons, does not cloud
Their liberty, see how they move their hands:
But unifies them with each strand of love.

Roses and hyacinths, prepared by love,
Repair the past: your heart was like a ball
Bouncing in caves of night, until the sun
Burned for you, darling, flowers in my hand,
Ensuring happiness after the clouds
Were cancelled by Apollo's net.

The dark dispelled by nets of night, another net,
Made of our hair, spun by the God of Love,
Lies softly on our shoulders as a cloud:
For love attends to lovers on this ball
Revolving round Copernicus's sun,
The testament of love signed by two hands.

Over your beauty you admit my hand:
Behaving happily in love we net
The birds of pleasure, symbols of the sun,
Whom we surrender to in acts of love:
Frotuna may be balanced on a ball
But the ball is Earth, solid in the clouds.

See putti in the clouds like dancers at a Ball,

A silver comet stoops across the sky
And vanishes into a woman's dream,
To dazzle there and function as a lamp,
Illuminate the grottos of sleep,
Colour the monochrome sea and flowers,
Behind her eyelids and defensive arms.

The stars make patterns, as of arms
Arranged in trophies up the wall of sky :
I lie on the other side of sleep
On the dark subconscious coast of Dream ;
My wish rides on the falling star, a flower
Whose petals cross the shadows like a lamp.

O coral heroes, fishes bright as lamps,
Inhabiting a sea of sleep where arms
Of divers grope for pearls in every flower,
O when they surface in the morning sky
Their hands divulge the perfume of a dream -
Accurate, innocent, souvenir of sleep.

Under the waves of sheets you sleep:
Behind the naked circle of your arms
Luminous vistas answer the lamp,
Mutable premises of dream
Where pearls can change to roses and the sky
Distends with pollen for the missing flower.

Symbolic landscape of desire, the flower
I dream of burgeons also in your sleep,
So though we sleep apart, the sky,
An iceberg in-between, reflects one lamp,
Which we divide in dreams - the phallic arm
That reaches out to morning from the dream.

Apollo's comet in the sea of dreams
Was an imprudent coral flower
And now the sunlight lies upon your arms
Like petals of a rose and sleep
Falls from your sleepy head.   The lamp
Expands to fill the total dazzling sky.

Souvenir of sleep, Apollo's lamp,
Comet of flowers, blazons the future sky,
When you will test my arms, my love, my dream.

blowing my trousers makes me look a little like a cowboy in Carol's
photograph but the top part is rather better.  I am writing to
thank her for sending it, as you recommended.

Will you book on the coach that is coming on Saturday afternoon?
I have an N. G. lecture at 2.30, which will be over at 3.30: so I
can easily meet the bus at Lewisham. I long to see you. Hetty
has swooned with excitement now that a date is actually fixed.
I wish that I could come down to Pett today as M will not be there
but, alas, that cannot be. Yawolla has set off, just this minute,
hearing you were alone, but I don't suppose, even running, he'll
get there till tomorrow.

I am very pleased indeed about Flugel wanting an article from Clif-
ford. I shall congratulate him tomorrow.

Here are one or two poems for you, my dearest creature, my muse,
written in the feeling of excitement that we shall meet again soon.

IDEAL OF A HOLIDAY
A slow boat for the staging of a noh-play
Idling via the ottomans of sunset.
Islands delay the mantelpiece horizon.
I'd love to get you on a slow boat to China
Though there's nothing in China to equal you.
Wake slowly, retarded by the occident.
Slowly the wake uncoils, detumescent,
On water dark and tangled as an octopus.
The moon rolls like a tear along the sheets.
The sea is honey and the boat our spoon.

AGAINST PARADOXES
Should paradoxes on the lips
Of a lover - take myself,
(Who has loved except ourselves?)
Grow like roses out of season,
Like a mansion on an iceberg?
Does not the wit of images 
Betray ambivalence?

But, my love, and only love,
Opposing images are idle
In the usage of our love.
Your roses do not tilt the season

",0,FALSE
11751545,gri_2003_m_46_b04_f04_023.jpg,"Because you are their climate
Because they never crinkle,
In your summer-equilibrium.

Desire is not a Rhine Castle
Astoundingly maintained on ice
Because I am your climate
And melt the iceberg prisms
Into rivers where we swim.
The sun is our simple mirror.
Around our love what paradox is felt?

SONG

I met an old man on the path.
Of Time he had this rule:
'It is the snow, my beard,
'It is the harvest, my hands.
'Time is a pastoral'.

I met a man in the square.
And he said: 'I believe
'Time is stepping stones,
'Like coins to the future's bank.
'Time is progressive'.

'Time is the lover's name',
I sat on the bed and sighed:
'For the waste land between kisses,
For the wall that stonily delays
'The union of the lovers on each side'.

WORDS  AS  THINGS
Who is the primitive that can suppose
The old gun or the wall, the anecdote
Of metal in the genre scene, is the gun
To drop a panting animal on the floor:
As well believe that musical objects
Shiny in a still life can be blown
To charm the fear which is not lenient
In the broken lustre of dead silence.
Well, I am victim of the sign, the bear deceived
By rumours of honey on the sunlit floor:
For as I write the letters Sylvia,
Your shadow and perfume mock new disbelief.

Until Saturday when we actually meet and touch remember
how much I adore you.  I shall write again tomorrow.
I love you,

Thank you for your two letters. First let me say that I shall be delighted to meet you on Sunday and do the inventory with you. Then, I take it, you will come back to Blackheath with me for the night? I will meet whatever train you tell me. I am so glad to see you again, then, alone.

Thank you so much for your letter. I think Miller has chosen excellently, don't you, and to judge from what you write it was a successful meeting. I need not say how pleased I am about this. What a wonderful thought - a room of your work at the Redfern : I am sure we will see it soon and Miller is clearly sympathetic. 
I am sorry that despite this encouraging news you should yet feel depressed. I recognise immediately M's work and can only feel regret that you should acquiesce so quickly in his professional dreariness. I could kill him. Can he not allow you to be happy or, at least, tranquil for a few days on end?

Dearest Sylvia.
The weather yesterday was so splendid - I hope for you, too. I spent the day (nearly 6 hours of it, at least) in the open & am slightly pinked in consequence. I forgot to pack my veils. The occasion was something called a gymkhana (JIM KARNER?) and it was mostly horses: hence Diedre's interest. The castle above Dandy is Sham Castle - that essential accent on the hills. There was also a pet show: you can imagine my pleasure at the apparently interminable events. I had hoped to go to Longleat but it is rather expensive. I am not sure about Bristol but I may be able to get there - I hope so.
Although I brought the Arthurian book to read down here  I find that my hosts have a copy of W . S. Gilbert's Savoy Operas which are very amusing indeed. Ruddigore and The Mikado I have read already.

My dearest Sylvia,
I must tell you straight away - I have not
been offered the Birmingham job. I am not
sure why not, but they have taken a Courtauld
student and a girl about whom I discovered
nothing. Though I am chagrined and fully
realise I must be sure of getting another
post (and quickly) there is an element
of relief, I must admit: though I admired
the Cathedral again (you know it is by
Thomas Archer) the rest of the city struck
me again as intolerably claustrophobic -
amusing for a night's lecture, oppressive
for a year. However, I must not rationalise what is, I admit, an intense disappointment.

going to apply to the Tate when the date
approaches. No I haven't sent the poem to

My poem is developing but is still in pieces. Here are a few pieces:

The lassitude of slowest mornings
When thought aims to Westernise the sun,
Incorrigible fountain, savage
Leaping buried lands like stairs, three at a time.

Like alarms & ardours of a youth
Slower to challenge than the glove he owns:
On a bride with ceremony weighed
nostalgically tendering the veils to hangers.

and

At night journeys uncoil like snakes
Which it is a temptation to tread on.
Sleeping women are the flowers 
Put out by the tendril night.

and

Like hanging baroque works in museums
Where workmen of awake put autumn stiffs.

It is a warm sunny day tho' not without sudden chilly jabs of wind every now and again. I hope you are now spared the musical TINGS in the hall of the Rectory.
The film man I met yesterday was useless but I have 2 more contacts yet to see, one films, one publicity in general. Last night John & I were taken by the Coopmans - with whom we lunched - to somebody else's feat. I cannot remember his name.

It is too sophisticated, he told us, for ordinary publishers - most of whom have rejected it.

The date given above follows the example of Dante Gabriel
Rossetti's - Tuesday, 1850.  As I have trouble with exact
dates I am rather taken with it.  Yes, you will see I am
looking up the PRB:  I dare say you know but Millais and Hunt
visited Edward Lear at Fairlight, where, presumably, Lear
was staying.  I wish I were visiting near Fairlight this
Sunday in 1951.  However, your lion must get down to
dates:  his diary is by him now.

You say in your most recent letter that you will probably come on Saturday or Sunday next.  In an earlier let-
ter you suggested such dates as 12th or 13th but (as you
said at the time) you had the dates wrong.  It was following those dates that I made the suggestions in my last letter about meeting you.  I take it, now, that I can expect
you on the 15th or 16th, 1951.

John McHale has a party on Saturday, 15th.  If you do
come to town on that day would you mind if we put in an
appearance?  I would unhesitating skip it but I can meet
there a man names People (in the advertising business) and
meet again two people I encountered fleetingly who have
BBC connections.  It would be delightful if you would
come but I do not want you to be overtired.

If you did not come until Sunday we will have Monday at
home.  Tuesday I have a lecture at the Tate on 'Impressionism'; Wednesday I start at Banstead; Thursday, 'The School
of Paris' (at the Tate).  Otherwise I am free until the following Tuesday.  So, perhaps one of those three days would
be the best time to see Muriel.  I'm afraid this may be
complicated reading but it is unavoidable:  'There', as we
say, 'you are'.

What splendid news about the Cricket Field Gate:  I am sure
it will be what Rossetti and Brown would call 'A real stunner'.
You have roughed it in and painted the sky already!  I am so
pleased and excited to hear of this excellent start.
Your account of the color is most vivid and I have an attract-
ive mental picture of the scene.

I am sure Twinkle was very amusing, intentionally and unintentionally.  I envy you:  or, rather, I envy your companions.  Would I had been there - my cat on my arm.  Clifford
ought to get Clerkson Rose's autobiography (just out), With a
Twinkle in my Eye.  It could go with Dusty Wusty's Diaries,
and Kafka's, and Rousseau.

I will certainly go to the Redfern during the coming week.

Here are some poems for you, at last. The Soliloquy
On The Beach is the one I began at Pett some while ago.
The one For An Aunt was prompted by my jealousy of Aunt
Margaret being with you when I was not. Oh, and Maria
Montez is a film star, drowned in her bath the other day:
she played Queens of Atlantis and that kind of role.

Carlyle must have been an off man. He came to see
Holman Hunt. Attacked indignantly The Light of the
World (that's alright - I'm with him there) but then
complimented the painter on the effect of moonlight in
The Awakening Conscience..!

The weather here is very windy but not, despite fitful clouds, wet. Perhaps it is similar at Pett and
you are able to paint. I hope to. At least you will
have your indoor models if the cricket pitch gate is
unsuitable.

I have just had another letter from Russell offering
me another B'ham lecture (Maclaren Young having fallen
out). I'm delighted to accept as you can imagine.
(I've sent him ATHENE too.)

I take it you will let me know soon when you are
coming so that I can meet you. I expect you any
time between Friday and Sunday, 1951, at the moment.
If I do not have time to reply to you about meeting
you, be assured I will meet you where and when you suggest.

Well Lion can just catch the 4:30 post. Then he
will have tea and probably read about the PRB though
he is seriously tempted by a book about Ezra Pound's
poetry which he got from the library. What a conflict:

Dearest Sylvia,
     I had a charming day yesterday.  John and Magda and I spent most of the afternoon and evening together.  Magda  was full of your praises, admiring your charm, liveliness, defining you as a real person among the shadows of the party.  She referred to you several times more than once during the day.  It was a great pleasure to hear you praised in this way:  you have made a fine impression on Magda.  John is anxious that you and Magda, he and I should have an evening out in the near future.  Would you like that:  Magda, John, and I  would very much.

     Magda, apart from financing John's kiln, is using her influence on his behalf, to get him sales and, perhaps, later an exhibition.  She is a kind of business associate, I quote...   So John will be able to work without too many worries for a time which I am glad of for things have been very difficult for him this year.  I need not add that John inquired most warmly after you, complaining again that I kept you so much to myself.

     Paul is coming to Blackheath today:  he will be able to see one or two new pictures by you which I know he will enjoy.

So I suppose really I cannot expect to see you quite yet.  Chalmsford is this week and the other three are the following week,  the week I hoped to see you again.

being a bit dotty, I think, for as you know, she specifically said I should not return: but, reasonably
enough Thoms at Cambridge had only arranged for accommodation for Monday, Friday, & Saturday evenings.
So here I am back for Tuesday through Thursday.
I was expecting to lecture about Hogarth at Ipswich
and prepared accordingly (tho' of course I had the slides
for the other lecture in my bag - a bag heavy with one
week's needs). It turned out - 10 minutes before the
lecture that the subject was Old Masters & Modern
Art. So I just had time to unpack and arrange the
slides and improvise accordingly: it was not too
bad, I think. An audience of 70 - mostly the local
art school.

How wonderful to have a letter from you again: I have not had one since Monday; it seems - it is - an age. I am staying the night at Cambridge again so I shall get your letter this evening: two in one day; that's what lions like best, they say.

How I wish I were with you while you painted at the Oak and in the garden. I remember reading you Pound in Mrs Hake's garden! By the way, speaking of Pound, here is the poem about H.M., rather influenced by Ezra P. I don't think it is successful really but I am glad I tried it.

In the two days at home I have written a film article about Strangers on a Train and His Kind of Woman: both have sorts of doppelganger. I have quite finished the part concerning the former - a little remains of the latter to do. (Perhaps I can finish it in the train today.) I am planning also an article comparing Sartre's Morts sans sepulchres and an American prison film Brute Force.

Clifford and Marjorie's reaction to the news that Carol is returning to the village for half-term is odd, very odd. They seem to be persecuting the girl. Are they guilty? I take it they must be. I quite agree with you about having a soft spot for Carol and I do not think for one moment that she thinks you foolish for it. My impression is that she appreciated you very much indeed.

Your dreams express exactly how I feel also. I long to see you. I thought of you last night very passionately for I read the article about Indian sculpture in The Listener (how very congenial) which you recommended to me the other day. It was interesting. I long to be a MITHUNA group with you again.

depressed by this & that. I have not completed the work I promised to do, nor am I

Sunday
Dearest Sylvia
Yesterday was not a day of rest for your lion after all. He went to I.C.A. in the evening because Madeleine was hostess for the 'social evening'. I am glad I went (apart from the dancing) because the Calypso singer Lord Beginner was there. he really is amazingly good. He is the most famous of the W. Indian singers of Calypsos. As you know, these men improvise and as Madeleine & I were in a conspicuous place we were introduced into a calypso about the choice of wines - he painted a picture of my introducing her to my family. (Hetty said she would love to see that! Would not mother be surprised!) 
Do you know I have not yet been paid for my lectures at the T.G. - let alone the Arts Council ones! (I shall soon have to send the moths in my purse out to look for friends who live in richer purses. They shall be Confidence-Moths - winning from the other moths of the 3-wing trick on Spott the Butterfly.)
When I told Paul about your sale he complimented the buyer on his taste & perception. P is working on a very large picture (circa 5 by 4 feet - or somewhere about that). It is an oil. We discussed it. He is not satisfied with his technique: he is influenced by Tanguy. I then criticised Tanguy because he implicitly adopts conventional perspective & hence is reactionary. (This is not a view I subscribe to particularly - but as you know that does not exercise me.) I left P,. I am afraid, wondering if his oil were not a mistake and that his freestyle in gouache were not more valid. He thought he might not finish the oil. I then tried to upset my argument but without much success. The dangers of art criticism! I hope he does finish it: provisional title 'Penelope in the Poet's Web'.
FROM A NEW POEM
The luminous ferns stray up the tree 
Of night whose fruit hang in the country
And in the mutinous waters: I wait 
Among the roots that hold the bale.
Do fruit split if you wait till they fall.
Why wait until they are shapely but rotten inside.
I cannot reach the country from these roots.
Stars are apples for the distant cider.

I am on my way from visiting Father (who will probably be home late
this week) to lunching with Madeleine. I have drafted the 1st act
of the Western for her. IC may be a bit too naturalistic as to dialogue at the moment - but we'll see. There must, she tells me, be
parts for John, Tony, Sandra, & myself. I think I shall appear briefly
in the prologue: I am murdered; the rest of the play shows me
being avenged.

Last night at Banstead was very enjoyable with Magda &
Frank. Admirable tea, splendid drinks (but all the time), &
a delicious dinner which included asparagus and an [unclear][/unclear]-
ian treatment of beetroot which was 'out-of-this-world.' And
several hours of pleasant chatter - full of compliments and paradoxes.

I wonder how you are, my dearest love. IC is Monday morning. I hope it is not too Monday morningish at Pett - all
washing, duties, chores. Do you not miss Tiny, really,
tho' she has been rather silly, - not having her to talk to
in between work? I know I should in your place. I
would I were with you. Sylvia - I adore, adore you.
Do you love me? Does the time we are apart wheel
clumsy treacherous wooden horses into our city? Do
not let in any wooded doubts, because I love you so
much. Absence is a bad thing for us but I love you &

If you are in town next Wednesday I do hope we can meet. I am free until
the evening when I must go to Banstead. How lovely if we can meet. If you do
not come I see that M is coming anyway. Do you mean he will come to Blackheath? You must let me know when: then I shall be in. Why is he going to
look for a room when he has a job at Cambridge...?
I wonder how you enjoy lecturing again.  I am sure that you will like it.
Hetty wonders if she can book the same lecture from you for the L.I. (Lion's
Institute) at an early date. Tell me if you accept (one kiss for 'no', two for 'yes').
Last night I saw Parsons again. Magda & John entertained him as a possible
buyer but I think that he will be no more [unclear]are[/unclear] to John than to me. He has removed
a good deal of his moustache but he is quite the same as ever I'm afraid. But
Magda took John & I to a very nice dinner first and we had lots of excellent
wine and that made up for the later part of the evening.
Your new picture sounds charming in colour and your sketch is full of sweeping flowing rhythms - as in your picture of Tiny In The Rose Garden though this
new one will, I think, be more successful. some dabbling of the paint after it is
laid in the sley is a  delicate piece of technique I hope to see shortly. (My
Hastings lecture is probably 6th December, by the way).
Here is a new poem called AFTER ANCESTORS WHAT
When marble trees, column
On the evening terrace,
Smooth dogs or hunting ones,
Skies made of drapery,
Are carted off by time,
Made chaos of by wind,
What is left except what's gripped by hand?

The skull is left, the scroll
unfurling to the night,
The sword-guard twining like
Female genitals around the waist.

When storms are energy
Not gestures of a block
No attribute is certain
Of identity and only
The convex of a mask
Faces the concave head.

And I am working on a on a poem comparing autumn to a Wunderkammer and another
one called NOCTURNE AFTER NINE as well as attempting to finish a few poems
on scattered subjects. In short I am writing verse again.
Lewisham station is being painted and really  it begins to look quite pretty.
Perhaps it will  be the turn of Blackheath next - it needs it.
Magda and John are both looking forward to seeing you again and so
are Madeleine and Paul. But even more passionately waiting to see you are
Dandy, Hetty, Lionel, & YAWOLLA. Oh  I love you so much. I
hope I see you on Wednesday. I adore you

I have just seen Miss Chick and learned from her that I am to be interviewed for the Tate Gallery position. She is one of my referees, you may remember. It is a change to have some good or at least potentially good-promising news to give you.

There may be a letter at home for me but as I spent the night at Wimbledon I have not had my mail yet.

The Kensington Art Gallery, I think, will send you an invitation. When I rang up Clare was not there but I explained the situation to a man who made a note of your name and said he would see to it.

The Post Office where I am writing this note is full of people filling in little pieces of checkered paper and attaching postal orders.  Pools, I fear in this island, are replacing dives. I may as well come into the open- I mean underground- and say I regret the substitution

Dearest Sylvia,
How can i thank you enough for Les Cheveux d'Hetty. It is enchanting and superb. If I were a monarch the postman who brought this illuminated manuscript without bending it would be knighted. Oh it is beautiful: it is beside me on the table as I write. The drawing and colour of the images is delightful and so, so is the poem. (It is a very subtle compliment to Hetty that you have used French words she knew.)  The music and the verbal images are lovely. This picture-poem is now one of my most treasured possessions.
I am glad to hear that you have found suitable frames for your still-life triptych and some others, too. And I am made very happy by the news that you have bought a Worcester Cup and saucer for your Hetty. When she uses it you will see her raising her tri-colour veils (in honour of your French poem) to sip tea from it.
Was the Dentist too clumsy? I hope that this time he was gentle and did not hurt you.
One of the applicants for the Tate jobs is Ronald Alley (spelling?) whom I met at the T.G. when he was temporarily doing the Assistant Keeper job there. So I think he may have a good chance of getting the post permanently. However, you never know and we shall see (as people are always saying).

latter is incomplete, has been revived and I can see it at Fulham in the week: ""Sands of Iwo Jima"".
Lion is reading Conrad's ""Arrow of Gold"", J.A.K. Thomson's 
""Classical Influences on English Poetry"" (which makes me want to
write some satire, of all things), and Bukofzer's (sic) ""Music in
the Baroque Era"": I am only reading the non-technical parts of

Water applaud as she advanced.

Eyelashes of trees were modest
But could not close my eyes nor hoard
For dumb material her beauty,

She sang as she floated tidelessly:
'I heard a song and it went
Down the open of my ear
Like the wanderer of the telling.

Like a brother answering.
The hill is a head and while I'm here
I'll know the mystery of words'.

Julia to an English poet,
Describing her delighting Ovid,
Among her atmospheric jars:
Inhaling from air's ancient pot
The Latin poet closed his eyes;
Perfume's invisible spiral
Entered his head with subtle power.

Ambiguous as Musidora
Crouched above her Friday's footprint
She promises to blood with flesh
The early nymph above the wier:
She entertains the mute adorer
On a night by History hidden;
He tastes her lips, her mouth's soft spring
Runs in the barn to drown his fears.

When I touch you my hands have grown
Breasts and eyes and teeth and groin:
Contact is like a girl shouting
Inside my body's cave until
Echoes of you are my heart beating,
And the muscles' loving tremble.

Dearest Lion,

I'm very distressed that you have a cold - and do hope that it is better. Do look after yourself. I must say that I think it was very silly and irresponsible to stay so late at Ithel's. I suppose you are being influenced by Paul's silly conventional habits. I feel very hostile, towards him. I do hope you didn't put Banstead off, as you have behaved rather unreliably this term and it doesn't do for a lecturer.

Thank you so much for taking all my works to the various places - I take it that the ""Poet in the Garden"" arrived safely and the glass was unbroken - I wonder how you liked the frame - I thought it looked very well.

We were all devastated by your

you were not chosen it is difficult
indeed to get a job! Anyway at
least you were on the short list.
Leeds would seem your ""cup of tea""
but I suppose hundreds of people 
will be after that. I am glad you
have applied to the N.G. and will
apply for the Tate - (which) - the
latter, would suit you very well I
should think. I wonder if Reyner-
Banham will be after it (he doesn't
appear to have a Christian name!) I
notice in Art News that he is lecturing at the Tate this week on the
Pre-Raphaelites and Alfred Stevens -
(in reverse order). Have you seen
Gainsborough - R.-B. seems to get
an awful lot of work for Art News
he seems to have a feature every week.

Thank you for your letter. I now enclose your chapter. Tiny has read it and thinks it excellent. She has two criticisms which I think useful. Both in the last half of the 1st paragraph.
""These buildings are Formidable examples of the Perpendicular"" Tiny says ""Why Formidable?"" She knows these buildings and does not quite see why the term should be applied to them. I am inclined to agree with her, I think you are probably being a little quilologuil (?spelling!) then in the following sentence you go on to discuss domestic buildings in such a way as to suggest that the Perpendicular Style is not Gothic - I don't think you mean this though Tiny and I are agreed that it is a transitional style.",0,FALSE

   Clifford read to us your article last night and we all enjoyed it very much and thought it extremely good.  I shall read it again - when I went to bed I reread all your dear letters. I hope you will forgive me for writing rather scrappily but I have had rather a rush round.

Love yourself as I do seeing you.

I
An afternoon lived in the day -
That afternoon a popinjay
Led a girl out of the house
Into gardens of the day.

The song lured the princess on.
The girl was a princess. The sun
Was a rose she tried to read
Lured by the darting popinjay.

She was lost in the languorous dark
On the outskirts of the park. 
The grass held no statues
Like the lawns near her father's house.

Where are Bonne [unclear]Bicycles[/unclear]
And the beautiful cat?
The popinjay is lost
In dusky silence.
I am lost.
Am I remembered
By the beautiful cat & sweet Bonne   [unclear]Bicles[/unclear]?
III
With sombre and dragging motion,
Unlike the girlish flight
When she followed the popinjay
As if she were an echo
Who never catches the singer,
She returns, perched on the scaly dome,
On the old grey shield, of a tortoise-back.
In sluggish ceremony she returns -
Like a diner slowly rising
From the languorous bed to air.

With a stag embroidered on his arms,
A gallant prince waits for the girl:
""Who is Bonne [unclear]Biche[/unclear] but the beautiful queen
""Finely poised as Fame, waiting for me?""

The spell completes its circle like a tapestry,
A rose stitched by the seasons and desire
Of a girl between the past and future.

Dearest Sylvia,
It was wonderful to talk to you personally this morning, even for six minutes. Oh what a pleasure it is to hear your voice again and not read your letters after an interval of 24 hours. I am sorry that I worried you on Monday by my silence. Your letters were rather shattering but I think there is justification for what you say. I love you so much: I hope that soon I shall have some good news for you.

Here is a poem for you:

Spy of the stars, my aberrant silver,
Travel had followed your directions, like a girl's breast near to broken glass.

I was my own frustrating Poseidon, Spooning the water into green delays,
While Doubt's suitors trespassed on my floor.

You have no reason to believe I read
Directions by the growing sun again
And not by snail tracks and the splinter stars:

You will know that this is so by waiting 
For moments of the future. When I come
I'll bend the bow of Eros for you again.

The weir no longer drags my craft.
Oh watch the nearness of the sea, for gold
Of sunlight carried to your feet by water.

I wrote this after receiving your telegram. It was so sweet of you to send it. Please be reassured of my love and, I hope, of greater responsibility on my part.

As you may know the Sevenoaks lecture is one of Alison Kelly's lectures I have taken over. It consists of a Van Gogh reproduction and lots of pieces of colored felt to play with. I must try and think of something plausible to do with all these bits. She only gave the material to me yesterday. So I must break off now and do a little work on it.

The ICA was very dreary. The only lively note was mine: I
was a kind of Senator MacCarthy about the art critics who like
Ceylonese painting and also sternly imperialistic about the
art itself. Everybody else was calm & competent except for
Patrick Heron who backed me up rather civilly. Not many
people came.

You know Mariane Moore writes syllabic verse. I like her so
much now. Here is a poem dedicated to her:

Dearest Sylvia,

Thank you for your regular and delightful letters.  How I do love to receive them: I read and re-read them.  What good news that your cold is quite better: be sure to look after yourself for the weather is a bit uneven at present.  Sometimes it is fine, sometimes, like this morning, you can't see out of the window for fog.

I have heard from two publishers. Hart Davis and Lehmann: in both cases it is negative.  They were nice letters but at present there is nothing doing.  At the moment I am just writing letters about ATHENE, I haven't seen anyone yet.  I am sorry not to have reported the I.C.A. occasion to you.  Not much seemed to happen about a projected film to make ourselves but the talk itself, about Television and Art Programmes was very interesting.  The general feeling, shaped by the speaker really, was that art could be used to make a good TV show but that TV could not present aesthetically works of art.  At least it has not done so yet.

I am trying to contact Paul.  Yesterday I called at his flat.  I have rung the Irving Theatre Club more than once.  I'll get him soon and I'll let you know as soon as I do.

Darling I do not think I can really tell you when you can go to the Greenwoods.  It depends on my cheques and they still (Wednesday) have not come.  I will let you know instantly they come. 

I have no quite complete poems yet but I go half-way to meet your welcome command for a poem by some fragments:

The plaza's in the water, one of those places
Lost by land to the herringbone sea
Voices music on nights still are heard
Alight in the water the Plaza sways
Siren of the liquid in,

In coats of the night, clots
On the season's web, delayed
By silver of the sticky clime, stars
The above is a cinema reflected in a river (at Bedford). Below a description of the sky:
Cables scaffolds Hs Ys
Fleche tips wings the soft ends of the hearth
White liars on blue ladders grids
To martyr silence with ringing camphor
Foreign trapeze to miss the white dimple
Of the moon in the warehouse lunette

In a bathroom:
The armistice of squares
Intact until the white skein
Spills, unturked I am left:

My dearest Sylvia
Thank you so much for the latest of your long and delightful letters - what
a good letter-writer you are- keeping your lion informed and warming him
with words of love. (You will have received yesterday's letter by now:
will you come on Thursday I wonder, as I hope so.)
Sorry about my hand: Tuesday's subject is CUBISM. Next, after all, a
lecture on cubism in Tate Gallery Masterpieces - or something of the kind.
I am very interested to hear about The Streetcar, though I am sorry to
learn it depressed you. I hope that you are cheerful again now: after
all, you've never been in New Orleans, have you. Well, then, says
Hetty. The cuts you mention interest me very much. I shall read
the play as you suggest before seeing the film. By the way, which
depressed you - the film, or reading the play. I assume that it
was the former mostly. Is that the case?
You are a fine cat: I am so happy to hear you have been wearing
gloves. The chickens in the garden do seem to be a wretched nuisance!
By the way here is a sketch of the electro-plated 'tureen' or
whatever it should be properly called so that when you come here
you will not be taken by surprise (you remember it was an Xmas
present):
Today I am going to see Zadkine's exhibition and then go to
the I.C.A. where Z. himself will talk about modern sculpture.
I am afraid that our cyclamen has not survived. Perhaps it
will revive next year. I hope so.
I have just been fixing up April lectures at the T G with Miss [unclear]Clamot[/unclear] as she is going away.
Look after yourself as I look after you in imagination.

Dearest Sylvia

Thank you so much for your letter. You do seem to have been 'poorly' (as I'm sure grandma used to say): I do hope that the Greenwoods' kindness (they do seem to have spoiled you, I'm glad to see) has made you feel better. It is good, too, that you stayed at Ditchling for 2 days. The rest, before returning to Pett (and, as it were, Littlehampton) will do you good.
I'm glad John was pleasant in the train, and offered useful advice. I met Mira accidentally in the Tate yesterday and went to dinner with Richard and her. Frank Cordell rang up while I was there: it seems he has taken a Mews flat near Regents Park, presumably giving up Banstead.
I have turned the page of your letter and see that the Greenwoods gave you whiskey and hot baths. I am glad. Though I hated losing you a minute earlier than necessary it was better for you than the stuffy overheated Tate. (I seem not to have a cold yet. That, by the way, is superstitious Dandy touching wood. It is a tree because the weather is so nice that Dandy is going for a walk in the open once he has written your letter.)
It was cold yesterday but this morning it is dazzling. It must be very nice at Pett just now. Are you, I wonder, working on your large still-life? Are you gossiping with Tiny? Busy (and gloved) in the garden? At the Oak? I shall think of you at the village hall tomorrow. How I envy you that, on the heels of the W.I. panto. too. Some cats have all the luck...
I have read the 1st 150pp of Moby Dick: 350 more pp to go. It is superb. I cannot put it down. The new [unclear]sarance[/unclear] has come: it includes a Kenneth Burke article (you know how lions like that!).
I love you so much my darling. Do, do take care of yourself. If you are not sleeping too well - take some 'powerful sleep inducing drug' do, just for a few days regularly.

  Thank you for your letter with the welcome news that your cold is almost gone. I am glad to hear it. And how are your sleeping? Poor Clifford - a cold on top of everything else. I hope he is not too tired to get rid of it quickly. As for Tiny - I could shake her really! Gloomy again - and yet being cheered up by Miss Peace! Oh well: the main thing is that she has cheered up. 
  Good for George: the dresses sound very nice, especially the navy and white one. Do you need to do much work on them? They sound in a good state. I am glad you found Esther Waters at Ditchling: I am amused you missed a train because of the book's fascinations. The other night I went to [unclear]Lea[/unclear] instead of Blackheath in the train because I was immersed in Moby Dick: so, we are a pair! Incidentally I am reading Tennyson's Princess: and do you know in what edition? That little soft-covered book from Pett. We looked through it, and you sang your lion a Tennyson song about Owls. 
  At Petersfield I glimpsed Looking at Pictures - the Arts Council exhibition I designed. EXH. is the art-historical abbreviation for exhibition.
  Saturday night Father & I (Mother being at a Dance) saw Out-cast of the Islands again. Afterwards I missed my train home so had to stay the night. In the morning I had to take Father to Nelson Hospital because a splinter under his nail refused to come out. Casualty soon removed it, however, and he was alright again.
  I have read an entire book on Rodin. Tomorrow's lecture is nearly ready now. I spent a nice evening with Turnbull last week: he admires Giacometti but thinks him Gothic, life-denying. He wants a more life-enhancing art: those were not his words but that is what he meant.
  This afternoon I am going to the Charlton to Lewisham libraries. Then back home to read Rodin's own book ART.

 I hope to be able to finish the poem, bits of which I read you, soon and get on to something more attractive. I have intuitions about what is needed to complete it.

What does Clifford think about Cocteau Englished? Would he be willing to check the meanings, senses? How are the Woods? I hope that C is no longer tired or suffering with his cold and that Tiny is cheerful (for her) and not in the process of what we doctors call littlehamptonisation. My 'Fessor must not put up with any nonsense that might interrupt her painting.

Incidentally returning to Cocteau: in the IJPA there are some comments on death (ugliness) versus aesthetics which suggest a connection, even if in reverse, with Cocteau. Joan Riviere is the writer. I have not sorted the idea out yet but it may be fruitful.

Water is dripping from the eaves and the snow looks soft so perhaps there is a gradual thaw. I hope so: I feared yesterday evening that it was going to freeze, so cold was it.

I hope you slept well Friday and Saturday nights. I love you so much, dearest Sylvia, I love you,

Dearest Sylvia,
Your letters are exhilarating as communications from you and yet sad because they are the result of our separation. Your account of reading Tennyson's Princess -just the thing for when you are not quite happy, you said- is poignant indeed. I know that feeling. When I lecture it is with your art as a kind of norm or standard that I speak - and sometimes you overwhelm the present occasion. That is how I felt during and after today's lecture, a strange feeling of closeness (because art and you are inseparable for me) and a sense of loss and surprise that I was, in face, alone.

I will send your watch-strap tomorrow so you should receive it on Thursday.

Dearest Sylvia,
Thank you very much for your letter. I am so very pleased to hear Clifford's portrait is going so well and that you are about to start on your theatrical picture.

I hope so for I admired it so much.
Delighted to hear that the digging I did in the garden has been a help. I will do some mere when I come. It is this evening I shall learn for sure that I can come. I hope I can: I expect I can.
Of course I shall go the Kensington Gallery, in the course of a day or two I shall make a special journey to the Salon. I will tell you all about it.
Thank you for The Times cutting: I have not read the article yet but I like the pictures very much. I do agree with you about the Ramsey: it is very French but I cannot quite think which Frenchman. Duplessis, perhaps: you remember his Gluck portrait from Vienna?
Here are some poems: the first six are Pett poems. The sequence is not quite complete. If I have taken a long time about them it is because I am trying to make them genuinely simple and terse. The other two poems are occasional: one a memory of the road up and of the tube, is anti-urban; the other deals with the popular defiled woman theme of Stanley and Stella, and Sanctuary, and No Orchids.
Father looked in last night and was very amiable. 

Today as you know Robert is coming. I plan to do the shopping this morning, put Antal away (!), and do some work before he comes for tea.

Rinaldo and Armida progresses excellently, to judge from your account.  You mention Grant's school, or style, in connection with your new landscape: I  disagree really, because your paint is always brilliant and lively whereas his, or theirs, is always dryish and blunt.  Your description of your days at Pett are vivid and intimate and make me feel that my imagination has been accurate in deciding what you would be doing.  The jam-making at night excepted - that I did not guess, tho' apparently Tiny would have.  (Speaking of Tiny - is she coming back today or will she extend her visit to Littlehampton, I wonder?)

An exhibition of abstract art was held at 22, Fitzroy Street, on 11th-14th July. This address is the studio of one of a group of abstract artists. It was open until  8.00 p.m. over the weekend and was thus accessible at a  time when the Bond Street galleries are closed. Using a studio for a group exhibition (despite problems of hanging) has advantages for visitors may expect to meet some of the artists concerned. The group has published two broadsheets and this exhibition (the second of its kind) is another effort to reach the public and as such deserves support.
Victor Pasmore is the centre of the group which includes Robert Adams, Adrian Heath, Anthony Hill, and Kenneth Martin. Their bias is towards constructivist art, away from the painterly, expressionistic character of much recent abstraction (a tendency represented here by Roger Hilton). In addition to this London group there are contributions from Cornwall-Ben Nicholson and Barbara Hepworth, with Dennis Mitchell and Terry Frost. Nicholson and Hepworth have continued the lucid, classicizing abstract art of the thirties into the fifties: the recent work of Pasmore (represented by two reliefs in the present show) is a return to this attitude, an attempt to restore the continuity of European concrete art interrupted by the war. 
After Pasmore Adams is the most developed member of the group. His sculpture and his collages have, for me, a rather English elegance: his sculptural shapes, at their best, are springy and firm, like a good cricket bat, his white lines are those defining a tennis",0,FALSE

Several mobiles by Kenneth Martin, especially Line In Space, are excellent, the best things he has done in any medium, and they show up the essentially shop-window character of Raymond Elston's mobiles. Anthony Hill is represented by a single can-vas, a tense composition of severe strength. Heath's recent abstractions are conceived more as abstractions than his earlier pieces in which his figurative habits lingered. His art is nearer now to Pasmore's statement (June, 1952) that 'Today. . . abstract art enters [or, at least, renews] a phase of construction'. 
It is understood that the group will exhibit at a gallery in London later this year: it will be well worth attending this show to see the large works, produced with a maximum energy, which are appropriate to a public exhibition.

Dearest Sylvia,

Thank you so much for your letters, containing such good news about your painting. How happy it makes me that I should be important to your art.

I do hope that you are sleeping better now, than you were the night you went to bed with Ruskin, as you sweetly put it. I am sleeping well now, and I hope you are, too.

How delightful is your memory of dancing at Notting Hill Gate at the age of six. I had no idea you did that, though I am not in the least surprised that you were able to. Enchanting.

My shoes are a great success, comfortable and smart: they do look very smart on I consider. Thank you for seeing them in the first place and for giving them to me. Yawolla says I am like the King, having more than one birthday in the year.

I met Lines at the Tate yesterday. He hopes I will lecture for him in the autumn. He has been to Arles and says everything there is yellow, the light, the houses, the lot. Then he mentioned the amphitheatre and said he imagined Christians being thrown to 'yellow lions'. I was delighted with the idea, as you can imagine.

My lecture on Hodgkins' gouaches went very well, I believe, and I heaped abuse on The Times and Cooper, and Newton. It occurred to me that her cows and tractors in the late works are like Staffordshire pottery: not actual pieces introduced into her work as in the 30s, but that she gives coarse, vital life to her objects like a Staffordshire potter. If a potter were to handle a tractor or grain elevator, this is how it would look...

During the week I have several lectures. One on Tuesday, on on Wednesday, two on Thursday, one on Saturday: the first and last are at the Tate, the others at the N.G. By the way, speaking of lectures: Mrs Cregan is away until next Monday. So I have arranged to phone her at 9.00 tomorrow: her mother thinks she is free on 28th.  I will let you know quickly.

I saw Le Roux: Newcastle has written to him.

Yesterday I went to an S.E.A. committee meeting in the morning and I enclose a drawing of some of the characters. I have a nice new book, for review: an Iris color book (Batsford), on Early Medieval Illumination.

Father is preaching at Abbey Wood this evening. As his medium has a car I have invited him to look in at about 8.30 for a cup of tea. So I shall have to take some of the pictures down. Robert

Dearest Sylvia,

Lion has been busy writing since Breakfast.  It is now 3.00 in the afternoon and I am going to post this letter on the way to Wimbledon to visit my parents.  I shall stay the night and spend monday with them, returning here tomorrow evening.

On Tuesday Anthony Hill is coming here as I mentioned.  Victor Pasmore has invited us both round to dinner in the evening so that should be very pleasant I think.

Yesterday's lecture on Manet was very well-attended.  About 70 people.  I find Manet most interesting nowadays:  I think I was right about his drawing but he is still a fascinating artist.  I have done a lot of work on the Bar (more than I can put into a letter without turning it into a lecture) so I shall save it till I see you.

The weather here is thundery and sunny alternately.  And at Pett?  I hope you are having a pleasant time with M and MMGG.  Did you have a nice time with the Savages on Friday?  I'm sure you did.

Here is a poem for you:

The clouds are waistcoats dressing up the sky, Sweet labels on the curving blue bottle, Tufts of a christian angel's softest wing:  But being alone Summer's a doublecross.

Rain in my face, slipping through air's net, Each crystal oval happy with rebirth, Dew on our mornings, come on with the rain:  The winter with you Has a summer charm.

The fact of you, of being there with you, Remakes the winter, softs the balustrade Of ice, and lacking you the summer is A lock without your key A hidden sun.

And here follows a poem about art:

Dearest Sylvia,
   I spent Sunday evening with my parents who were very well, 
bronzed and fat.  So fat is father that I have 'inherited' a new
sports shirt which he has worn only once!
   The decorators are coming in to 11 Mansel Road so I had an 
energetic time helping Father clear certain rooms, take up all 
the stair carpets, and so on.  Splendid exercise... splendid...
   Then in the afternoon Edwards 
took us for a drive.  We went to 
Godalming in Surrey and had a 
home-made tea at the Refectory - 
a 15c building which has been dolled 
up but is, nevertheless, charming.  
We whizzed through a sequence of 
pretty villages so lion saw a 
spire here, a porch there, a green, 
a statue.  The new Red Cross 
Country House is in the neighbourhood so we visited it.  A county 
mansion build in the 30s it is a horrible fussy Wren pastiche but

of a great hill.  We obtained some peaches from the gardener.

It is marvellous news that you can visit me.You suggest coming on the 15th or 16th. Either day suits me very well. I must warn you, I cannot be sure of having much money.

I hope that it is clear and quick about the dates, as you requested.
I am glad George liked your paintings; glad, too, that M was pleasant and says he will be helpful. Good!
Thank you for your encouraging remarks about The Guard drawing. I will try and work it up soon. I have not time at the moment. I am busy getting tomorrow's lecture ready - on Dadaism and Surrealism. Ward, by the way, was quite well received: about 25 people.
Have a very nice time at Pasmores. A pleasant supper: then Wendy disappeared & P., Hill and I talked about ART. Mainly about Picasso and Mondrian and the choice between concrete art and abstracting pictures from nature. Hill had some interesting opinions & recent news of art in Paris. He tells me, by the way, the Pichabia in the T.G. exh., is ca 1912 - which is incredibly early. Pasmore is coming to tea, here, on Sunday 10th.

Alas, I do not think I can go to Bats as soon as you. i have too
many lectures in August to allow me to get away this month. Perhaps in September... It is too early to decide on date just yet.
Thank you for sending me the clipping about Bristol. I am most
interested in it. I would have no objection to lining Bristol - it's a charming town. I am not sure my qualifications
are quite niger but I shall certainly try run it.
About Pasmore: yes, I like him rather. He is not 'pompous &
pontifical' with men, however he may treat his wife. I gather
from Hill that he keeps an eye, and a firm hand, on the group
round him so that there shall not be serious deviations from
abstraction, but that is something else. I will send you

How nice of Mrs. Clark to accompany you painting. I am very glad she wants you to paint her daughter- it will be very nice to have a new model, I am certain. Next week is the quietest week of the month for me. I have to go to town on Thursday (two lectures) and Saturday (one lecture) only, but there are always things to do in town, so if you need to go to town on other days I shall quite understand. 

Last night a friend of Paul's took him and me to see ""The Millionairess"". Katherine Hepburn is extra-ordinary in a part written for Edith Evans. ""Somewhere between HAM & CAMP,"" I said: Paul suggested the term 'HAMP'. it is really fascinating to watch the weird prima-donna-ish rhetoric, a virtuosity quite unrelated to life as art- simply the product of the theatre. I adore it in such skilled hands as hers. The play itself is pitiful: it's a shame there wasn't another play with as big a part for her to appear in.

This afternoon I am sitting to Madeleine for my portrait again. Then I am going on to Edgware to visit Myranda in hospital. I am looking forward to seeing her again: It has been a long time. I shall come home early and have a long night as I am rather tired.  But first Hetty has some housework to do.

However Dandy is not only listening to nonsense - he is reading it
also. I am half-way through 6 Existentialist Thinkers: so far I have
read about Kierkegaard, Nietzsche, and Jaspers: I have Marcel, Heidegger, & Sartre to go. Seriously some excellent points emerge. For
instance, Nietzsche says it is no good expecting X-ianity just to fade out
like the belief in fairness - it is too involved in our whole culture for
that. N hated X-ianity. The only way to get rid of it would be by a
total rejection perpetually renewed. Surely we in 1952 see he was
right? It is the rationalist error to think it would be overcome by a
mere accumulation of facts against it. There are some long
quotations from Kierkegaard: he is an enchanting writer, a brilliant
ironist (I see where Auden gets it).
I am getting on with my lecture notes: I am reading Groddeck
who is better than I expected. His Symbolism in Language & Art
is especially useful to me at present (notably the section on
Wagner's Ring). Wimbledon library has also yielded Jones' 2 vols.
of Essays in Applied Psycho-Analysis as well as a collection of
essays including Kris on Approaches to Art. I hope that my letter
is not turning into lecture-notes or a book-lovers guide to
something or other but I must quote Groddeck on Birthdays: 'To have
 a birthday, & for 24 hours be lord of the earth! Yet there are
people who say they care not a jot about birthdays: exiled
monarchs, whose kingdoms were lost in childhood!'

The Pedestrian musical is one where all the dancing & singing is rationalised in nightclub or theatre performances: the balletic is the type in which the dancing & singing grow out of a real environment, like On The Town and Belle of NY.

   What is the position of my lecture now? Will it take place as arranged? If it does not would C still like my article? If he needs it he shall have it, as the Journal is so far advanced - Or, possibly, an obituary will take up the remaining space.
   Poor George Savage- I am glad you were able to bring him 'instant relief' as the advertisements say. How did The First Meal In The New House go, on the electric cooker? You are an expert on those machines - I hope Beryl soon learns to handle it.
   I have almost finished a poem called Aphoristic Remarks on Maladaptation of Giants : the 1st part of the title was suggested by a Ferenczi article, the latter part by some giants who figure in an abstract play by Kandinski (Wassily, of course). But, of course, the poem is about something else. I will send it tomorrow.
   How did you like the Kensington Gallery cards this month - I mean the 'one-man show' card? I like your projected card more.
   I am reading some of Hardy's poems 'Time's LaughingStocks' is the not un-typical title.
   I had a long talk with Molly on the 'phone yesterday : she is rather better than she was when I gave you news of her the other day. After a nosebleed she felt better.

Clifford has just phoned here and we have arranged to have tea at the Tate Gallery together
this afternoon. The reason he found me here 
is this.
When my glands swelled up again I thought
it time to see a Doctor: my parents agreed and,
of course, the only Dr. I know is at Wimbledon -
Dr Reader. He examined my thoroughly
and was uncertain what it was wrong with
me - and ordered a blood test. That was
Saturday. I couldn't have the blood test
until Monday and he did not hear the result
until today: it is perfectly normal as to white
corpuscles which means I have not got
glandular fever. He said it seems to be
an 'ordinary infection': I can 'carry on' and",0,FALSE
11908212,gri_2003_m_46_b05_f09_021.jpg,"it ought to go away. He examined my chest,
also, and found nothing wrong. He also treated
my finger - cutting off a good deal of the nail
and painting it a charming shade of violet. (It
is either a fungus or a 'nerucca' - I think I have 
it right - nothing serious but probably obstinate.)
I have not sent you details stage-by-stage I
thought it better to tell you the result all at 
once. I have not especially enjoyed the suspense and there was no need for my cat to 
share it with me - but miles away. So forgive
me for keeping it back until today.

I have been back to Blackheath at intervals and I shall return tomorrow for good. How I look forward to being there, though my parents have been very kind: they have fed me phantastically. I have lost some weight: I will soon replace it with fare like theirs.

of when I was a cub (4 1/2). I visited an aunt

11908237,gri_2003_m_46_b05_f09_038.jpg,"THE SEXUAL BASIS OF ART *
In classical psychoanalysis art was studied for several reasons. Ernst Kris (i) has pointed out that the arts provided a field of investigation outside pathology. It was necessary in the first third of the 20c. to establish the ubiquity of sexuality in the arts, as in the unconscious minds of individuals. Another point that was emphasised was the relationship between an artist's work and his life: this has been convincingly demonstrated in Marie Bonaparte's massive study of Edgar Allen Poe. Applied psycho-analysis (with the brilliant exception of Freud's Leonardo da Vinci (2) has worked better with literature than with the visual arts because psychoanalysts tend to have a better knowledge of one than the other. (Ella Sharpe, for example, once quoted, with equal respect, Van Gogh and Dame Laura Knight.) (3)
Recently attempts have been made to study the arts with attention to specific problems of technique and aesthetics. Harry B. Lee, in uncollected articles (4), for example, has considered the psychological distinction between masterpieces and bread-and-butter pieces, and the specific nature of creativity. At present this field is in a fragmentary but evocative condition. Often people who have not mastered the classical phase of psycho-analysis acquire a spurious modernity by rejecting the complexities of recent research. Our concern here is not the recent controversial refinements but the classical work of psychoanalysis which it is irresponsible and prejudiced to reject now. However, it is my experience that hostile critics are reluctant to consider the psychological background of the arts, despite the consequent gain in",0,FALSE

appreciation.
Two essential terms in the discussion of the sexual basis of art are (i) sexuality and (ii) sublimation. R. Wood has defined the first term in the Journal of this Society (5) :
The child is a sexual being with a rich but varied sexual life of its own and will habitually and spontaneously engage in sexual activities which, if engaged in by adults, would be described in our society, as criminal, perverted or insane. These observations led Freud to describe the child in his famous phase as 'polymorphous perverse'. Sexuality was not limited to the genital region, but expressed itself also through other regions of the body - the erotogenetic zones. 
Adult sexuality is a complex drive made up of various instinct components which became organised under the dominance of the genitals.

Freud defines sublimation as follows (6) :

the sexual impulse abandons an aim previously found either in the gratification of a component impulse or in the gratification incidental to reproduction - which new aim, though genetically related to the first, can no longer be regarded as sexual, but must be called social in character. 

Sublimation is essentially unconscious : there is no question of consciously sublimating genital sexuality. Dancing, singing, writing, painting, all represent a scale of subtle transformations of sexual energies. It is not possible here to offer an explanation of what causes psychic energy to be sublimated in different forms - why one writes and another paints. 
However, the need to express a repressed desire in a socially acceptable form provides the impetus for artistic creation, that compelling and magical act. 'The new aim', as Freud said, is 'genetically related to the first'. The sexual elements in the sublimation will be the object of our enquiry.",0,FALSE

     I am not including modern art in this essay for two reas-
ons. Those of you who do not understand modern art might be
distracted from our theme. Those of you who do admire modern
art should need no instruction as to its sexual content.
Sexuality is more easily detected in the
original art of one's own period than in the art of the past in
which it can be overshadowed by reverence, history, and style. (7)

                                             II

     The complexity of a work of art is one of its sources of satisfaction.
Its origin is in the artist's unconscious mind: it is radically
modified by sublimation; and, in its sublimated form, the work
will express a constellation of cultural ideas (as J.L. Lowes
shows in the case of Coleridge in The Road to Xanadu). The
multivalence of art ensures the presence of sexual meaning on
more than one level, from the directly sensual appeal to remote
allusion. Let us consider a series of examples of increasing complexity,
starting with works designed for court patrons in the 16c. who
expected a measure of sensuality.
     Classical mythology is rich in erotic occasions: Titian's
Rape of Europa, 1559-62 (Boston), is one in which sexual activity
is expressed magnificently from the female point-of-view. The
bull (traditional symbol of virility) ploughs the sea (traditional
female symbol) while Europa herself clings urgently, precariously,
to his back. Her legs are parted and her hand clasps his
horn. These rhetorical symbols are intentionally sensual and ardent.
Correggio's Jupiter and Io, ca. 1530 (Vienna), also conveys the sex-
ual experience from the woman's side: the sense of the tangible
",0,FALSE
11908246,gri_2003_m_46_b05_f09_042.jpg,"Bronzino's Exposure of Luxury, ca. 1546 (NG) is a more
intricate work.  Time and Truth expose the erotic foreplay of
Venus and Cupid.  Envy, Deceit, and Folly comment on the disappointments attendant on desire.   The picture makes a moral
point by means of allegory but unconscious symbolism also appears
to operate here in covert, but close, parallels to the manifest
meaning.  A device common to art and the dream is that of splitting one figure into several:  Venus, for example, attracts Cupid with
an apple (oral pleasure) but holds an arrow behind his head; Deceit offers a honeycomb and a scorpion in transposed hands, so
that the right hand (good) is really the left (bad).  In Venus
hair is a jewel of a woman combing her hair:  she is in the pose
of Venus, but Envy claws her hair (the fingers like a comb).  In
another version of this picture at Budapest Envy appears as a
Gorgon.  These figures are ambiguous, deceptive versions of Venus
(Cupid's mother) and recall the 'good' and 'bad' mother of clinical psychoanalysis.  Melanie Klein (8) refers to 'the early splitting of the mother figure into a ""good"" and ""bad"" breast mother'.
Cupid covers the left ('bad') breast in an effort to efface the
frustrating side of his mother, the mother who does not always satisfy his oral need.  The loved and hated aspects of the mother
are exposed in a pattern of morality and incest.",0,FALSE
11908248,gri_2003_m_46_b05_f09_043.jpg,"
Jeromn Bosch is an artist preoccupied with sexual symbolism. The intentional meaning is often of great complexity but that is not our concern at present, though it is of interest to note that an alchemical doctrine with which he was bound to have been familiar assumed the sexual basis of all matter. He is one of those religious artists who consider the universe as a place of distraction, illusion, and peril -possibly even the creation of the Devil. His animistic sense of a landscape which nourishes monsters is related, not to rational thought, but is an image of early childhood before the differentiation of the self from the external world is achieved. Desire and guilt are mingled in S. Jerome at Prayer, ca  (Ghent); although the S. is seen at prayer Bosch lavished extraordinary care on the landscape, which is riddled with orifices, disturbed with phallic growths. The ground itself is organic, reminiscent of phantasies of the creative properties of excrement. I do not want to relate this pervasive sexuality in Bosch's art to a particular event or feature of his life: it is sufficient at present if I can persuade you that the spectators of works of art, ourselves, deny an essential element in art by avoiding the recognition of sexual content.",0,FALSE

Dearest Sylvia,

I am wild about your sketch of your
new painting.  It is a lovely composition with ravishing perspective,
sucking one into the picture but this
movement is delayed by linear design
and, I am sure, color.  And what a good
shape!

Yes, we must talk it over, but I do
think some publicity in the local paper
would be an excellent thing.  With a
little discretion and ambiguity we can
get over it.  Here the illiteracy of
20c journalism will work for us.  And
it might do you some good, I think.

Poor cat, I hope Nora is not too
fucking spiritual today.  Perhaps she
will be earthbound for your tea date...
Any hope of that?

I enclose the Ramsgate cheque and
thank you very much for advancing it
to lion.  (Lion, by the way, has just
paid two months' rent!)  Good lion.

I have been typing out my Lincoln

I enjoyed my Lincoln visit.
Lunch with Lord Ancaster & the cream of the local History Committee. Conversation: horses, pheasants (which we also eat), Lincoln traffic. The Lord Lieutenant is tall, 40-ish, with a tweed cap, and a tin foot. Charming, but, so far as I could see, entirely brainless. After the lecture he drove me at high speed to Grantham ('near where I live' as he modestly put it) across his county. Hogarth was mentioned: 'Oh yes', he said 'I've, er, got a couple. [unclear]Er[/unclear] Morning and Evening'. Actually he has Afternoon & Evening: [unclear]Bearstead[/unclear] has Morning, as I pointed out. 'Yes. That's right. 'Course', he said 'Grandfather must have given half the set away'. I mention Kauffman - as you suggested. 'No', he said 'No'. Then: 'Wait a moment. Used to have an Adams' house. Sold it. Lots of her stuff there.' [He said Adams [sic]] But, as I say, he was charming. He took me to Grantham so I could get an easy & earlier train back to town. He told me he had knocked a man over the other day. The man was unharmed & when he saw the Lord Lieutenant get out of the car he refused to complain, insisting it was a privilege to be knocked down by someone so distinguished. Ancaster was at the meeting & address, of course. Another committee - of which he was President was mentioned - & he could not remember its proper name.",0,FALSE

Of considerable interest among the celebrated names are two oils by Mark Gertler, one a School of Paris exercise, the other an imposing still life.  there is a good recent portrait by Mathew Smith, a hit after many recent misses, and - something of a rarity - a Lowry oil sketch for a large picture.

There is Meninski's post-impressionist fruit, void of association, its raison d'etre purely formal; at the opposite extreme is The Library Table by Isobel Nevill in which the objects exist not in painterly terms at all but purely as symbols of the bourgeois good life (flowers and a penguin book).

Dearest Sylvia,
I am sorry my last letter was so short but I wanted to show you my review. I enclose this time a copy of my handwriting review for you might be interested in that, as you patiently heard bits of it in the writing.
My journey home was easy and comfortable, except that it was taking me away from you. That is something I cannot bear for I love you so dearly. I hope that this time next Sunday you will be with me, dearest.
Gainsborough was amiable on Friday. Said he thought it sounded a nice show after he read the review I brought in. He gave me a large book on the Duncan Philips collection, Washington, to review and wants me to do a full-page article on De Wint and Hilton as he is going to make an effort to increase 'Art News' provincial circulation. This week I hope to see the Tate Hiltons.
Yesterday's lecture went very well, though the numbers were down a bit: 45-50 instead of higher. Mrs Onslow-Ford came and I gave her tea. She has lent me a recent sketch by Gordon O-F which may interest you when you come. (Do you know yet when that will be?)
Do thank Tiny so much for entertaining me so splendidly. 
I enjoyed it and I think I have put on some weight. I do enjoy my visits to Pett, not only because of the joy of being with you, but because I see Tiny and Clifford. I love them very much. How did C's sex lecture go? Let me know all about it. Did he like Walton? Hope Marjorie's hand is no worse.
I am writing two poems which I shall try and finish this evening and then I shall put them in my next letter to you. Speaking of my poems reminds me of your new paintings and let me say again how very much I admire them. They are good, so rich and yet rich with a more economical means than sometimes in the past. Is it the influence of your 3 huge still life for Mrs Bergman?

A Book of Scripts. by Alfred Fairbank. (Penguin Books 4s.)
Sweet Roman Hand. By Wilfred Blunt (James Barrie. 15s.)
Written By Hand. By Aubrey West. (Allen and Unwin. 7s 6d.)
Good Handwriting and How to Acquire It. By John O. Tarr. (Phoenix House Ltd. 5s.)
Carolingian minuscule was developed during the revival of
learning associated with Charlemagne. It was a hand of great
clarity, free of cursive tendencies - though 'lower case'. It
developed into the Gothic Script of progressive heaviness and
angularity. Humanists of the 15th century rediscovered the
pre-Gothic Carolingian minuscule: it was imitated, first in
Florence, then in Rome, where it was named Cancelleresca.
The cursive form of cancelleresca is what we mean by Chancery
and Italic. The four books reviewed here recommend and italic revival.
Mr Alfred Fairbank's King Penguin A Book of Scripts was
published in 1949 and this year a third edition has appeared.
Penguin Books Ltd. do not bother themselves with small editions.
We can be certain that the editions were large and that a great
many interested readers must have seen the book. The question
arises then, who is going to read the more expensive books of 
Mr Blunt and Mr West? So important is Mr Fairbank's position
in the field of modern handwriting that both writers have gone
over the same ground as Mr Fairbank with the same purpose. Excellent as Mr
Fairbank's book is, it is to be hoped that it will not stifle
independence among his supporters.
The pattern of the argument runs like this  (it is also
found in the short historical section of Mr Tarr's book):",0,FALSE
11908307,gri_2003_m_46_b05_f11_007.jpg,"TRAJAN'S COLUMN      TWO
a reference to pre-history; Trajan's column, with its superb
capitals, and modifications of this; Charlemagne; Gothic script
(which is invariably and unilluminatingly compared to Gothic
architecture); and with a feeling of relief, the Renaissance.
Jokes about the English 17th century writing masters follow, amusing but
tangential, and then the 20c and the italic revival. It is not
a service to the 'cause' to repeat this piece of special pleading indefinitely. Imagine a reader who had read Fairbank and 
wished to study further: neither Mr. Blunt nor Mr. West
would substantially advance his knowledge.

However, with this general reservation in mind, let us consider the books on their merits. Of Sweet Roman Hand Mr. Blunt
writes: 'The object of this book is to advocate a general revival of the italic hand today'. He presents his case with an
excellent lightness: lightness in the sense of 'clearly' and
'not heavy'. Many of his illustrations are of the writing of
notable British monarchs, soldiers, and men-of-letters: Charles
II and Cromwell, Addison and Sir Joshua Reynolds, right- and left-
handed Nelson, and so on. This attractive feature is not shared
with the other books reviewed here.

One must compliment Mr. Blunt on the close relationship of
text and illustration. Mr. Aubrey West's Written by Hand
unfortunately is deficient in this matter. A typical page -
bound to discourage the newcomer - offers this: on p.20 there
are references to 'Caroline (sic) miniscule', 'the half-uncial',
and 'Gothic script'; facing are illustrations of Littera.

ANTIQUA antiqua or lettera anticha formata and Lettera anticha
corsiva. Nevertheless Mr. West's book is an informative and enthusiastic introduction to the subject.
     Mr. John C. Tarr's Good Handwriting and How to Acquire It
is, alone of the books reviewed here, practical. He offers
instruction in the acquisition of the chancery script and
discusses bad hands of various kinds - a chapter which prompted
personal disquiet in one reader, at least. Chancery is recommended
for Clarity, Speed, Beauty and Pleasantness. There is useful
advice on pen-nibs, models to be imitated, margins, paper, and
rational flourishes.
     'Who will deny', Mr. West demands, 'that a letter written by
hand will impart something that is direct between friends, and
that it is a gesture no machine can make?' I will. To assert
this is to be guilty of a sentimental, anti-mechanistic bias with
which handwriting - if it is to prosper in a machine age - should
not be associated. William Morris (with whom modern handwriting
has a direct link via Edward Johnston and Sir Sidney Cockerell -
Morris' secretary) made the mistake of resisting the machine emotionally
instead of attempting to humanize and improve its products. The
machine need not be 'inhuman': after all, the first italic type
of Aldus Manutius, which has influenced even typewriter letters,
was based on hand-written italic.
     Fairbank, Blunt, West and Tarr all admire the Renaissance.
It is to their credit that they do. The hand they recommend is
charged with humanistic associations. As Mr. West points out, 'to",0,FALSE
11908310,gri_2003_m_46_b05_f11_009.jpg,"TRAJAN'S COLUMN FOUR
clothe the writings of...Horace and Cicero in gothic characters would have been inappropriate'.  However, this is an age in which Horace is, to the majority, a character created by Harry Hemsley, a comedian, and to many Cicero is the code name of a secret agent. Mr West feels it necessary, for example, to refer to 'the poet Petrarch' and Mr Fairbank writes William Morris, 'poet and artist-craftsman'.  Apparently these names are insufficiently familiar to stand by themselves.

The Renaissance standard of firm grace and lucidity expressed a total attitude to life, which continued when the writer put down his pen. This is not the case today. Though one's good will is with the handwriting reformers, one needs to recognise, in view of the importance placed on it by these writers, the humanistic root of the revival. But without the society and ideals of the Renaissance what does the adoption of its handwriting amount to? The revival is nostalgic: it does not come to terms with that essential [unclear]monster[/unclear], the machine.

It is a problem which art teachers may need to consider, sooner or later. Whereas italic is a graceful dependent of the revival of classical culture most modern art teaching in the schools is non- or anti-classical.  Whether the duality is unimportant or disturbing, and if the latter, what should be done about it, is an open question.

It also asks - what of those women (the ones with the loving hearts) whose fate it is to wait for the one man? The answers to these ridiculous questions are absolutely complacent. Much of the film satisfies the supposed wishes and standards of those who, not having pretty faces, consider their hearts capable of love. The view of the world presented is, therefore, to say the least of it, narrow. The good girl Susie and the bad girl Bettina have a reassuring rigidity. In the handling of the two actresses something of Griffith's exceptional quality shapes the corn: Bettina, the dark one, is always hipping it, running, extending her arm and flapping her hand, (we call it 'waving'); Susie, the fair Lilian Gish, on the other hand, is graceful in a constrained way, restrained, and, when she is excited her jumps have a childishness untouched by Bettina's seductiveness. The contrast of these two figures always manoeuvering around the solemn hero is charming - not just in terms of simple characterisation, but in terms of imagery and rhythmic movement. The action covers a number of years, long enough for the hero to marry Bettina, rue it, and lose her as a result of bad weather on the way home from an illicit party. Only after this is the true heart rewarded. Time is almost Bergsonian in its happy avoidance of age and a sense of waiting.

We have in fact that familiar phenomenon of the movies - a remarkable technical authority lavished on a subject-matter designed for the comfort of morons. It is like most of the films of

Wilson writes: 'He shows that the contemporary world of the

out of it is that although genital relationships may be rare in
narrative terms, sexual interests are constantly aroused on the
screen. The genital relationship is often implicit
as the motive for action or in the development of a situation which
the camera does not follow through. Full appreciation of movie

11908368,gri_2003_m_46_b05_f12_020.jpg,"is all right for men with good physiques. But men can't wear
falsies'. Perhaps Miss Mayo hesitates to disparage puny male fans:
anyhow the point is obscure, though incontrovertible. 'Sure, I
like beefcake', Eleanor Parker is said to have said, 'when the
picture calls for it'. Presumably this raises again the nice
matter of good and bad taste. Joan Crawford is approving and
tolerant: 'It's time men were given a chance to get in on cheese-
cake'. To quote the Beauty Parade caption writer once more: 'When
muscles bulge now, so do feminine eyes'. The taste for beefcake
is parallel to the newish stress on the good she-wolf (as opposed
to the bad she-wolf of early movies). The masculine habit of
appraisal and selection is permitted to the female in movie mores
now. As the song in On The Town put it:

There's the corner where the boys hang out,
As each gal goes by they rate her,
Whistle and try to date her...

The predatery male is now accompanied on that street corner by
predatory females. In Don't Bother to Knock Marilyn Monroe's
exhibitionism in a window to look Richard Widmark thrilled two
girls near me in the cinema. The sex which Edmund Wilson cannot
see in the movies is there really: Mr Wilson is really too well
brought up and too literate to spot it. Without the sexual basis 
where is the predatory female and the beefcake cult?

P.S. What I said about beefcake not pleasing women only still goes, of
course. The point here, however, is that it does please women
as well as queers.

Here is a poem I have just written for you:

I do not love the dark, the thin,
And any that I could get in,
Even for the purpose of a line.
When you are gone whole nights and days
No other but adds to the malaise
of missing you in all ways.
Neither in word nor fact can I
entertain inconstancy:
I am my own love only.
I do not love the dark, the thin;
No other but adds to the malaise;
I am my own love only.
Until again you are my love, my rival.

I am glad to say the weather is clear - if not actually fine today so I shall have no difficulty with today's travelling. It is 8.45 and I must be off in a moment. I hope you are well, sleeping well, painting easily: you are in my heart always, dearest dearest cat.

I had another Christmas present from a lecturer. A voluptuous and handmade box of chocolates. Steeling myself I have resolved to give it to Mother who is now off her sugar diet.
It is 10.00 and I am exhausted. The Christmas tree is decorated and so is the entire drawing room and mistletoe is secreted about the place. All my least useful muscles have been brought into what can only be described as play.

is so little money about.

My dearest Lawrence
I am so happy to have your letter. I regret to say I am still in bed with a god-awful cold. It was on my chest yesterday but luckily with Lalers and ipecacuanha wine it is much better. I shall try very hard to get well as I do want to come up to town. Tiny thinks I ought not but I will see. I feel rather imprisoned here, and Tiny, consciously or ""uncs.""ly works on all my fears - will you really write to Cardiff, do you still steal - your ""bad"" social attitude - they gave me quite a lecture on it when I got back - and Tiny is become quite ""un-American"" again!

I'm sure I should hardly go out at 
all in the end!  and become dowdy 
as Clifford is always inveighing against 
fashion.  But more important than 
these reasons is that I love you 
tenderly and passionately - my adored 
creature, my poet and Muse - without 
you I should never have achieved 
all this painting and should probably 
be dead by now.  Forgive my doubts 
and do reassure me about Cardiff - 
though I feel sure that you will have 
written after what you said to Mollie.  
Don't worry, my love, but make every 
possible move, do.  You promised 
me you would months ago when I 
said I would give my name as 
a guarantor to your Bank.  I'm sorry 
to seem to rag - but you do too when you 
think it necessary!  One thing at

Who will tell when they see a serene spring picture of an old fig-tree against a sunny landscape only slightly softened by the morning mist the tears I shed as I painted it or the tragic significance it had for me. So often in our lives the world is a paradise which we in our weakness cannot enter in but throw away our birthright for the infantile mess of pottage.  There lies tragedy, not in the [unclear]Kiosery[/unclear] horrors of Bacon.

Thank you for your two letters and news. Clifford wants to know who the psychologist is! We thought about you continuously yesterday and wondered how you were getting on and when your interview was. I wonder how you are getting on to-day - I imagine you will have had your interview by now and perhaps be on your way back - it's 1.30 now - I suppose if you are successful you will be appointed at once - in which case I expect you will wire me!

After Mrs Hake had gone I went off and did my shopping and when I came back I did a lot of washing which was not much of an effort as there was plenty of hot water over Tiny's sink. It is the necessity of waiting for kettles which makes the whole business such a bore as a rule.

Also, financially I am quite dependent on letting the flat and living here at a low rent - my own money gets less every year; and if Tiny or Clifford's mother should die they might make other plans.

Dearest Lawrence,
Thank you for sending such a marvellous Christmas poem - I adore you. I hope you had a happy time - I shall be writing to my Aunt to find out when she would like to see me - I will let you know at once - perhaps you would tell me any convenient dates - or inconvenient dates! When you will be away from home. I shall only stay with Aunt a night this time - I must also make some final arrangements with Chase!

My dearest Sylvia -
""The Childhood of the Poet"" is only a provisional title: another idea was ""Master, I bat on"". It is as illusive (elusive) to christen as ""Hogarth"". No, ""Hogarth a reassessment"" won't do: it is a descriptive sub-title, not a title in itself (& there are too many books just called Hogarth). The other poem is one I mentioned - the poet attacked by objects and then reconciled to them: again the title is not final. Once the nature of the murders in ""The Childhood"" is realised, they are, I hope you will find, less alarming. I have written some more of ""Hogarth's Friends"", am preparing next week's N.G. lectures, and feel like writing some more poems. I have re-arranged the hanging of your pictures, and they give me new pleasure.
I love you

Was there a king dead in the waste lot
Among the derelict boards of trespassers,
The tyres and rusty cans, the puddles
That break like glasses at attacking weather,
Wast there a king and was he dead when I left?

How many assassins ended on dry boards?
One who might have known the fire-escapes,
the tropic island at the time-bomb moment,
Dies on the cracked and lengthwise boards
As if he were spilt milk in a cafe.

Was there a half-caste drowned at high-tide?
Her body disintegrates in long
Undulant tunnels of undefined span
Or is islands patient as coral
Under the uneventful outside of the sea.

Was there a virgin buried in the avalanche?
When the stones buried her perhaps they buried
The entrance of a mine in the defile,
Hid a window box and a tennis court
From the sight of her lover on the hill.

How many poets perished at my hands>
Their bodies melting like snowmen
Into the papers that might have held poems,
Or stifled at the bottom of the bed
Like lions beneath the stone feet of a knight.

Was there a princess suffocated here?
The suites that might have sacrificed her age
And made a paradise by paradox
Will never happen for historians
Who might have prospered on her exquisite crimes.

Was there a singer sighed to extinction?
Is she more, who might have serenaded
Princes tiny behind their opera glasses?
Empty the stage and unthrown the roses.
The voluptuous gestures are curtained.

Was there a hero I triumphed over
And only just in time? When I stood up,
Panting a little, wind crowded me
Like ovoid cudgels or spitting cupidons.

I washed my hands and did not look in the glass.
A channel-swimmer was folded like a towel
In the bathroom by the silver taps,
Among the bottles and bent combs.
Her arms felt soft as stockings on my thighs.

I killed a gardener. I crushed his head.
I shall return one afternoon and find
The clothes-line rotting in the gaunt gazebo,
Weeds taller than the balcony and the orchard
Flashing flinty capsules, not soft fruit.

Did I cut the throat of an introvert?
He would not notice. Was there more to come?
That was him lying on the cushions.
Perhaps a girl he might have tortured will
Will rave in Easter Island loneliness.

I killed an extrovert. He screamed for hours
As the hives and telegrams retreated,
As he lost the scent of flowers and horses,
As the slanted walls dissolved in crimson fronds,
And the sense of plenitude diminished.

How many sailors will not see the wings of cliff
Swelling from the crystal ball of mist?
As I lie on the lea and count the pearls
That I can shake lose from marine-creatures
I count on the silence of the crow's-nest.

Was there a countess of the North who died
Before the sun was West? I sank a fan
In a lake of fingers. Now the ice
Makes a dazzling hall unscarred by skaters
Who did not last the violence of summer.

Sensual and hampered as oases,
Among cassoni of success I down
The yielding dead and bury lovingly
The heroes of the cult in rocky places.

And hang like bunches of grapes from the trees
Above the readers of detective stories.

And left before the genius loci woke.

Tongues nestling on moist lips, do not vanish
When a deluge ravishes the boards?

Too tired, this time: the aching muscles slide
Down the chute of sleep and bells ring
With clappers of roses and I leave
All murderous encounters to the night.
Now I am equal with the helpless dead.

Fans with fingers quiver on verandahs
In the dying days and longing nights.
Did a girl die in the bath of evening?
Was there a manic dancer lost forever
Who would have spun around the room on one toe?

Did these soft scissors end a tailor's life?
Did the tape-measure contract in his hands?
Did the mirror crumble like flowers?
Delay my poet...
The broken pearls
Lead like a trail of fish's spawn into the dark.

There were the objects, there was the poet.
They floated in the avalanche of light,
Sleepy from the excesses, raving
In the flux no orator could pattern.

Time riddles the poet by the sphinx
Squatting on the mantlepiece like a clock,
The numerals sadistic as a flint,
A salad of shark's teeth and spiky numbers.

Erudite chairs posing their geometry
On the enigmatic square of carpet:
There was the problem, there was the poet
Helpless as a vase filled with water.

Poltergeists are talented exponents
Of the pathetic fallacy, he reasoned:
But the flying furniture did not abate,
Accepting no eremitical ideal of repose.

The green arm chairs tremble like cascades,
The electric fire prances like a horse,
The table regresses to before the axe,
The mobile is planets dripping fire.

Bars of the wind, oh the streets escape
From the table chained to my tongue.
The photographs of the glass aquaduct
Is complex as a prism of two rooms.

Suppose a dream made a riot active
And the wardrobe opened to a desert,
Curtains were the color of a fallen neon sign,
Carnations broaches at the throat of death.

Suppose a dream raised the room
A hundred feet, the garden as a ceiling
A hundred feet below and the flowers
Dropped out of the earth and fall like meteors.

New as a haircut with distant connotations
Of the sphinx, the princess, and the prism
The chair eclipses the window and I lie
Breathless on the lunar moss and wait.

Forks symbolise Poseidon's enmity,

Pottery of memory, fired by fear,
Be modelled by sunlight and local colour:
The centaur and the wizard shall be softened
To the iconology of peace.

The repose of rooms is evident
By the symmetry of their collapse:
The mirror is a placid ranch and now
The anamorphic vision swivels down.

Half of the salad of the year is segments
Of the contours of repose, of orange
Cool as columns supporting a blue pediment
Inscribed with loving naturalistic figures.

Here and on such steps as light exposes
Morning is the profile of jardinieres
Filled with the spiral nipples of afternoon
And the curled flags of the sensual night.

We can embrace like figures in a double plot
Across the loose-ends and the differences,
On shelves cleared of books for the purpose,
Or draped in a spider's web of stockings.

Straw hats of summer spin through the window
And rest on table, chairs, and corners of the bed.
The large glowing eye of the lamp
Is what moths mistake for stained glass lights.

When I wake sometimes the bed delays
With the roses of the startled lovers.
The perfume of the thoughtful, and the fish
Leaping wild, uncovered, of the dream.

Only in the message of pearls alive
On girls who nourish pearls by their flesh
Can I learn the peaceful hieroglyphs
That personages carve on trees of sleep.

Not masks but instruments the furniture,
My map, my thebes, my sightly quarter,
I am not the last alive, the only
Poet with woodwoses in the wings.

Lovers are foreign to claims of gravity;
The visa of their lips, the hair of wings.
Love, your pelvis has a lyre's shape.

Give me the eye and vanish my disquiet.
Is that a bridge on the left? I'll buy it ...
There is the table where the statues are,
Like lamp, and mermaid jug, and numbered book.

The fruit makes canyons in the dawn
Whose slopes are thick in the dawn
Whose slopes are thick with mounting sleepers
Shadowed by exquisite corridors
Of vines and the sun-handled orchards.

Palm of the hand, Tuscan cherries in it.
Be with me in this concord when the glow worm
Is lost but lost in light in which we draw
The sun's fullface from the moon's profile.

This is the world where the lamps implore
The shadows to return the stolen lamps.
This is the world in which I veer between 
The vertigo and beauty of desire.

He may be thought to count the fragments
to make a tribe out of a single girl:
maybe another hand among the pair
would lead a multiplying family.
Since Adam was the father and fell
he is no alien who sorts the flesh.

In the daily corridors, the stairs,

a mouth deprived of muscles and a jaw,
watch breasts minus the human cage, a head
mobilized in currents of the airshaft,
crushed by a comb or risen to a hat.

Great head on hoardings think twelve hours a day
and eyes in neon persecute the night:
somewhere else, another part of town,
bodies rehearse olympiads of power
witnessed by the anecdotal crowd
intent on pleasure just beyond the nose.

Instead of London or New York these signs
travel ahead of me and shape the fall:
these relics overlap the city's cross.
corrode the skyline and the terraces.
(Always a queen, sucking the morbid lips
and playing ball with John's romantic head.)

Voices in empty rooms set me looking
for the sign of a wounded oracle,
bleeding yet not speechless in the corner,
dust on her lips and daylight through her mouth,
carrying on, excited and obscure,
'men, not gods, should eat Prometheus' liver'.

which left our perfect ancestors in bits,
replaced the body that had been intact
with local fetishistic hair,
with nails or nipples, eyes or feet,
and screwed the navel in the shrinking flesh.

Across the waters of a five-pence sea,

see how people get this impression but it is not the relevant

excellent jokes about it, as in L'Armoire Velante.  I should
describe Les Jeux Interdits as an idyll.  Death governs the
action of the film, but as an exquisite game.  Though it is obvious to an adult audience that the enchantment of the children's
game cannot last indefinitely, there is little hint of menace
as the adult world infringes on their play.  On the contrary, there
is an extension of implication outwards from the children's notions.  Innocence is made the vehicle of satire of religion,
the official form of death:  from Paulette's prayers as she
buries the dog to the grubby hand groping for the altar-cross,
the mockery is unmistakable.  Lyricism and pathos, reminiscent
of Poil de Carrotte, is strong, of course, but the sound French
tradition of anti-clericalism operates in les Jeux Interdits.
The power of these children to subvert--unconsciously in the
case of Paulette, mischievously in the case of Michel, who is

Michel's world, in which death is displaced from reality to
play, is lyrically expressed--whispered words at night, gifts,

I am so sorry that you are still in bed and it is distressing news that your chest is still uncomfortable. Do be careful of yourself. But I can see that you are being careful (you must be well for your show) from your decision not to travel before 19th. I am terribly sorry that you will not be with me as soon as you hoped and as soon as I hoped. That is a vile thing to happen. However, I can see that you must,  on no account, get behind with your framing: everything having to be prepared by 19th. Well I look forward very impatiently indeed to the 19th. Do not go out more than is absolutely essential as the weather is stinking.

By the way, you did not tell me the price of the Still Life with Chianti Bottle so I took it upon myself to price it at 12 guineas, which seemed to be in scale with the other prices. I hope that is about right?

Here is a poem for you: no title, yet.

The rhetoric of lovers is their breath.
Skin is the orator and harlequin
Whose words are jumps, whose dancing is a speech.

Taking a body as a sign of love
Who listens hears the tumult of the skin.
Limb alphabet and visceral tidings.

The north-south which-way delta of the nerves
Supports the purpose of the landing swan:
Leda as you, wings as your eyes, and mine.

Be eloquent by being as you are.

Tiny seems to have handled the reporter splendidly: good for
her.  I am glad that he liked your work, too.  The business
about 'the husband of the painter' is very neatly contrived.

I shall be only too glad to get Pengelly's picture.  I have 
not been to New Malden since I-don't-know-when, it will be
amusing to see the place with architectural-eyes.

As you know, I saw C last night which was a great pleasure.
He tells me that you have been really unwell (worse than I
had quite realised from your letters).  I am so unhappy to 
hear this but I am relieved that you are better now than you
were.  Thank goodness bronchitis did not develop as was feared.
It is so unusual for you to be ill like this and forced to 
remain in bed but I do think ('philosophy from the den') that
this enforced rest may do you good.  C told me that you decided to finish Blacker before reading Harvey's memoirs:
poor, plucky cat.

C took me to the Danish restaurant - the 3 Vikings - and I
ate an amazing quantity of food: so much meat... It was delicious.  I am afraid that it was expensive but you know how
C is, he would not let me pay for anything, nor would he have
a drink afterwards as he went off to see Hull-Walton.  It was
so nice to see him.

I saw the musical about Eva Tanguay ('Pull down the gangway,
Here comes Eva Tanguay') and it has 3 interesting dances, one
of them sensationally good.  Mitzi Gaynor, however, was not
so well cast as in Bloodhounds of Broadway: she's better as a
simple girl than a fast one.  It's called The I Don't Care Girl.

Elsie King, Connie's sister, remembered my taste for cactus and
has given me a handsome cactus, about a foot tall, with purple
flowers.  It is at Wimbledon at the moment, but I hope to bring
it home in a day or so.

What a time you are having my poor darling - I do hope that your hopes of being better by this weekend are fulfilled. I am very disturbed to hear that one night you could not sleep until 5 .00 - how wretched. What I am glad to learn is that Tiny is being nice to you again - that, at least, is good news.
 Thank you for the Times cutting: as a matter of fact I knew about it already and am very keen on the job. It is fairly easy to reach the Geffrye Museum from Blackheath, I think.

Dearest Sylvia,

Please find enclosed (as they say) your Vogue letter and
the typed version. I have left out the Art News bit as I
don't suppose Vogue knows much about that paper. You left
out one of the pattern no. so I could only leave a space.
Also I have put in the Kensington Art Gal. cards which may
interest you. I enclose Art Newsletter, also.

The morning the sun is bright and I can see birds darting
about. Possibly this is a good sign of better weather, or
maybe only another tease. I hope it is the real thing for
I am sure that some nice weather would do you so much good.
How are you now? Better? I do hope that you can say you
are. Tell me exactly how you are, my love, my rose.

Oh, something else I should have put in the first paragraph. Please find enclosed, your photographs. How charming you are in them, charming. I am reluctant to send them
back but you will need them for Vogue. What about Homes and
Gardens? Your painting of SYLVIA arrived safely and though
I do not see quite what you have altered it is much better,
as you say. I have it on the mantlepiece, now.

I have a copy of the Matisse poster used for the current
exh. which I have pinned up. It is charming and bright.
I do not usually like posters up but I will make an exception
for this one.

Thank you for the spelling corrections in Les Jeux Interdits.
Another one, I think, is carrotte for carotte. I was very nervous to realise that C was going to see the film on my recommendation. I hope it will not be another Le Diable au Corps.
Let me know if he likes it. (I agree about Impinges: thanks.)

I hope you are sleeping better. My own nights are a little
odd at present. I always wake up at 8.00, sometimes sleeping
very lightly and fitfully from about 6.00. And I can never
get to sleep before about 1.00. So I am having regularly a
short seven-hour night. I cannot break the pattern, but I
feel alright...

Dear Sylvia Sleigh,
Thank You for your letter received yesterday
morning.  I am very sorry indeed about the cards.
I must accept the entire blame for the delay (it was
an unfortunate misunderstanding between myself and
our printer) I can only hope the the emergency measures
have partially saved the day.
Normally we do not find it necessary to proof
a catalogue for the reason that there is hardly ever
the time to do it and we like to try and get the numbers
in the right sequence.  In view, however, of the narrow margin
between February and March shows I have abandoned the idea
of attempting a sequence and the catalogue is already in
the printer's hand for proofing.  He would like to know
however, if you wish the catalogue to be printed in
""Bodoni"" (as your card) or the Gill type, examples of
which you have seen here.  If you will let me know by
return the answer to this question the catalogue shall
be proofed forthwith.  Incidentally for its final colour
I suggest the orange type on a green paper.
The ""New Statesman""rate for classified advertisements
is 3/6d. per line (minimum 3 lines).  Let me know your
wishes in this respect when I see you on Thursday.
All good wishes,
yours sincerely,

Dearest Sylvia:

The Lautrec lecture went pleasantly
yesterday, though two ladies left at
one point, for moral reasons, I think.
Afterwards I looked at the Siqueiros
paintings again, meeting, inevitably 
Robert.  Last night I saw Greta
Garbo in The Atonement of Gosta Berling (Swedish, 1923): it was a terrible film, but Garbo was great.  (I 
left after two and a half hours!)

This morning I have written something
about Turnbull for the sculpture article and soon must have some lunch,
it being 1:45.  (For elevenses I had
one of those delightful chocolate men
and thought of you very hard.)  This 
evening I have to see the Cordells
and John: I won't forget about your
portrait of Magda.

It is good having Ajax and the Poet
back here and I love The Tyre Furnace.

I talked the flower painting over with
Mother and as I expected she does not 
want a very big one.  18 x 16 is the
kind of size she would prefer.  As to 
flowers, that she leaves to you:  she
would prefer 'pinks and petunia colors'

Easter Sunday

Dearest Sylvia

   Thank you for your letters. Oh, what an Easter card! Strictly for Minotaur!
   I am glad to hear the model is so accommodating. Pleased, too, that you & Tiny seem to be getting on well - with a small conspiracy to keep C from realising he is not too-well. However, he cannot be very bad if he is writing (I know how little he enjoys doing that): it sounds a very interesting subject indeed.

   Don't worry about the Unknown Polit. Pris. ballot. It won't make any difference to the prizes & - anyway - by yesterday only 47 people had voted - such is the ox-like, bone head lethargy of the Eng. art-lover, art-hater.

   Of course, stay with me as long as you can till aunt Do is ready to visit you. (Be warned I have to go and see one or two of the sculptors to interview them for my article but that will only take a little time.)

   'Dig that' means 'do you get that?', 'surprise'. It is rare for Ithell to give things away you see.

   I lent Paul H. Neurotica. He showed it to Kenneth Hume, who he lives with, & KH showed it to Hermine Gingold who adored it. She has even adapted a sentence from it as a new tag-line - that is to say, catch-phrase. 'Well, that's enough for one evening - eh?'

   I know you think I do too many things and diffuse my creative energy but it is possible this flexibility may pay off soon. I expect to write - 'on spec' it is time, with Frank Cordell & Alan Carter - a ballet for TV. Also Paul H & I are considering writing the treatment of a film. He is in the business now and that is a help. He might be able to sell it if we can create something suitable. (Also - no money in this - Frank Cordell is interested in one of my ideas for an avant garde movie which he might make in the late summer.)

   The only time I am going out today is to post this letter. Otherwise I am staying in to write.

Easter Monday

Dearest Sylvia:

I hope that you have had a happy Easter. I thought of you
constantly and imagined you in various settings at Pett that
I know so well.

As for me I will tell you what I have done over the Holiday.
I enclose part of what I wrote. Also a page about the Garbo film. Carbon copies of the start
and near-end of my article on Portmanteau films. I have 
practically completed the final version now. also I have 
written about Michaux' poetry and silent film comedies of
first decade of 20c. I have written bits and pieces of the
sculpture article. I have typed most of the poems I have
written recently, and prepared Tuesday's lecture on The Unknown
Political Prisoner in which I shall deal with some of the new
German sculptors.

I feel a little bit stunned after doing all that so quickly
and today (though I have been working this morning) I 
am going to meet Paul Harding. we shall see Come Back,
Little Sheba and then have coffee with Molly.

Your letter has just come (or, at least, I have just found it).
I am sorry your period is bad but awfully glad that it has arrived.

I have not taken Pengilly's picture back yet. Should I not
do so, after all?

I have read Hemingway's To Have and Have Not, a weird book,
really terribly bad except for a few, very few, passages.
although short it seems to go every which way.

I had coffee with June at the Tate Gallery the other day.
It seems Alan Reynolds is an old school-friend of hers. He
lives at Shoreham which is easy to get to by bus from Blackheath. She suggests I ought to visit him... I am mildly
tempted (and that's a fact). It seems he is totally unspoiled by success: doesn't that make him sound priggish?

This weather. How April can you get? I am glad you were able 
to get that nice walk in. Already this morning 3 bouts of brilliant sun and 2 of torrential rain.

See you soon. Rest while your period lasts.

13249738,gri_2003_m_46_b06_f04_012.jpg,"There is no audience for the one- or two-reel fictional film.
The few series that linger today, such as Leon Errol and Joe Mcdoakes, are clumsy and primitive. One- and two-reelers today are
either documentaries or cartoons. Formerly short films were the
cinematic equivalent of the short story in which one situation was
established and, it might be explored. It was the custom to think
in series, however, so that the compact identity of the short story
was blurred by the continuity of favorite characters, say Chaplin
and the Keystone Cops.
Recently short stories have caught the attention of producers
again and an effort has been made to fit them to the normal running time (90-100 minutes) of feature films, not by blowing them
up to epic proportions (The Snows of Kilimanjaro), nor by adding
a weird causal structure to a vivid plotless original (The
Killers), but by containing several stories under one roof. The
portmanteau film, as it is sometimes called, has characteristics
of its own which might repay analysis. It should, perhaps, be
made clear at the outset, that I am well aware of the role played
by more convenience in the popularity of this kind of film with
the studios. Although many actors are employed, the making of several short pieces may represent a total economy of studio-space and
shooting schedules. Here it is my purpose to consider the expressive powers of the genre as such and ask the question - can several
distinct stories add up to something more than that many separate
stories? When we read a book of short stories there is no such
feeling as the book can be read spasmodically and in any order.
Once in the cinema, however, we are faced with a fixed number of
stories, usually joined by one device or another. It is this link-
",0,FALSE
13249739,gri_2003_m_46_b06_f04_013.jpg,"2
age and the implied coherence of each group of stories which will
occupy us here.
     Another distinct between the portmanteau film and the book of
short stories is that the arrangement of the stories in a film is
calculated in a way different from the arrangement of a published
collection. The episodes in Full House, for example, are (i)
amusing and witty, (ii) manly and harsh, (iii) poignant with up-
lift, (iv) comedy, (v) sentimental. Take Souvenirs Perdus: the
moods are bitter-sweet, humorous, melodramatic, and farcical, in
that order. Quartet offers irony, failure, eccentricity, sophisticated comedy. Though the word quartet should not mislead
us into looking for musical analogies there is no doubt that the
episodes are arranged more carefully than, say, the sets in a music
hall. The complementary character of the parts persuades the
audience to consider the whole as unified and not as four or five arbitrary pieces.
     The short story is a popular form in the 20c. and there are
generally thought to be two poles between which the form extends.
Three is the tight, neat story which concludes pungently and ironically and there is the story of atmosphere in which a situation
is presented without conventional preparation and closes without
an epigram. The pure example of the first type is mechanistic,
rational, and worldly; the pure example of the second type is intuitive, sensuous, and Bergsonian. The respective dangers of the
two manners are (i) a false automatic conclusiveness and (ii) formlessness. The stories adapted by film makers do not belong to the
latter group and their vices are not formlessness. In England",0,FALSE
13249740,gri_2003_m_46_b06_f04_014.jpg,"3 Somerset Maugham has been popular with filmmakers and Noel Coward's one-act plays have also been used; America has reverently
taken O. Henry from the shelf which usually only appears in trailers; Max Ophuls has adapted Guy de Maupassant. Original film
scripts are often reminiscent of the first story type, too: many
critics compared the episodies of Paisa with the Maupassant.
The short-story in the de Maupassant-Maugham manner encourages
distrust. We read the story, watch the scene established vividly - 
provincial France, the British Empire - or what have you: we may
be taken with the man's economy and precision. We meet, as it
were, the people: the charming woman or the beastly man, say, and
if one is au fait with the idiom a question rises. This charming
woman, will she seem charming at the end of the story, this brute,
is he totally love? Unlikely, for this type of short story requires a twist, either of situation, values, or character: complacency is overturned, heartlessness is circuitously vindicated,
affection brilliantly short circuits itself, and so on. The obligatory angle is the expression of a Digest-scepticism. The
short story is a vehicle for fragmentary insights, produced by the
dictates of literary form as much as by an attitude to life. The
attitude follows the form, not the other way about. I venture to
guess, without any statistical support whatsoever, that most readers of the short story are not students of literary form. However they frequently accept the crisp and tiny worldliness of the
short story and assume it to be valid outside the formal limits 
of the game. 
Irving Howe (Sewance Review, Winter, 1949) observes that 'unlike the novelist the short story writer can seldom enjoy a sense",0,FALSE
13249741,gri_2003_m_46_b06_f04_015.jpg,"4 of distance from his materials'. The novelist 'can count on major advantages unavailable to the story writer: the accumulated, unpredictable effects of prolonged characterization, the independent momentum of a plot that becomes something more than a mere frame for manipulation.' In the mechanistic story, and in the portmanteau film as we shall see, there is no creative distance and plot is rarely more than 'a mere frame for manipulation'. The story and the authors are naively intertwined in an art-as-the-mirror-of-life equation.
II
Episodic films may be divided into three categories.
Weekend at the Waldorf, Holiday Camp, Bank Holiday, Domenico d'Augusto, and others suggest a vertical structure: the stories are the consequence of urban overcrowding or of saturnalian participation in a festival. A kind of simultaneity is conveyed -  of stories unfolding concurrently in time - that is to say vertically.
A horizontal form is to be seen in La Ronde, Dead of Night, Paisa, La citta se defende, and others. One main point of view governs from these films, beyond that of a common site or occasion (the vertical form). Attitudes to desire, fate, war emerge so that the episodes contribute to a point of view which they concretise or illustrate.
Finally, there is a class of episodic film in which the bits remain distinct: this form, seen at its simplest in the Somerset Maugham films and in Full House, might be described as the centrifugal film, or falling apart movie. These films offer no gestalt. Sometimes a framework is forced onto the pieces to make one point ultimately appear. A Letter to Three Wives and",0,FALSE
13249742,gri_2003_m_46_b06_f04_016.jpg,"10
Souvenirs Perdues belongs with the vertical group though it has a fatal centrifugal tendency. It provides excellent opportunities for talented French actors and, it should be said, nobody disappoints in this respect, though it is the very vitality and resource of the acting which makes the film fall apart. The linking device is very slight and there is a feeling that the authors of the four episodes wrote for the actors and tacked on the objects dictated by the device afterwards. The film opens in the lost property office in Paris and one of those omnipotent understanding commentator takes over at once, pointing life’s little ironies, asking the questions which his stories will answer. An Egyptian doll with a ballet skirt on it, a violin, a fur, and a wreath: the doll is the souvenir of a sentimental love affair; the violin is part of a pleasant story of a policeman’s unsuccessful wooing of a widow with a ‘musical’ son; the fur was used by a maniac to strangle a girl; the wreath introduces a farce, violently amusing in the bathroom and at the graveside. The stories do not 
",0,FALSE
13249743,gri_2003_m_46_b06_f04_017.jpg,"11
add up to a single point and the implication is that any of the
objects in the office might be traced back through a total net-
work of encounters, failures, violence, pleasure.  In that sense 
the film depends on giving us a sense of the city with all its
inhabitants - the complex simultaneity and, at the same time, ,dis-
parate existence of people.  That is implicit in the device-for-
continuity but the stories are too neatly packaged up in half-
hour sections labelled bitter-sweet, regional-humorous, and so on.
In Le Plaisir (1952) the device-for-continuity is again magical and irrational.  The commentator is Guy de Maupassant himself, terribly cute and French, speaking from hades or wherever.
The identity of author and story is cemented here, denying the
distance and autonomy which the novelist can enjoy.  The mechanistic story is beautifully exposed by these devices-for-continuity which do not betray the original authors but do them
real justice.  The three episodes deal with sexual pleasure from 
a moral standpoint: in the first we encounter a few puppets 'under the shadow of pleasure': in the third a couple are bitterly
linked, paying for their early pleasure; in the second the point
is, I suppose, in this context, that Rivet does not copulate with
Rosa despite the flowers and the fine weather.  The commentator
is the point-of-view underlying the stories: the author is his 
own form.  The writer with a God-complex is superbly in the know
and his comments are designed to make us marvel, chuckle, shud-
der at the bag-of-tricks which is life.  Destiny as the gimmick.",0,FALSE

on Monday if you wish to. On Tuesday I have a lecture in the afternoon
and the dinner in the evening, so if you

Dearest Sylvia,

I miss you very much and wish that you were here with me.  If only you were here we could go to the Hampstead Arts Council Ball to which Madeleine invited me as a reward, I suppose, for writing her catalogue.  I remember last year so clearly - how fine you looked in costume.  We really shall go dancing as soon as you come back.

I hope that your journey back was comfortable yesterday - I am sure it was.  And, tho' I tease you, I am sure you guided your aunt expertly.  The weather today is marvellous, so it must be superb at Pett.  Lucky aunt Do to be with you there.

Wimbledon
Monday
Dearest Sylvia:
I do hope that you are enjoying the visit of Aunt Doe.
Until today the weather has been pleasant so perhaps she
has accompanied you sketching.  If I do not make a mistake
Tiny returns today; I expect everything will go off very
pleasantly.  Does she get on with Aunt Doe?  Probably, I
should think, remembering that she got on nicely with your
Welsh aunt (whose name escapes me just now).  Let me
have all the news, won't you.
I went to the Ball at Hampstead:  Paul came, too.  He asked
after you and said how good your exhibition was.  He looked
very well.  The Ball went very well:  many excellent costumes and everybody was happy and charming (except for one
fight).  Wish you had been there, wish you had.  George
Borchard made most of the arrangements and made an elegant
job of the decorations and procession (Elizabethan).  Tho'
the theme was Surelizabethan I just wore my suit.  I slept
the night at Madeleine's and was woken by Charlie, her great
cat, staring into my face from a distance of 6 inches.  I
had the presence of mind to lie quite still.
I finished Madeleine's introduction to the catalogue in time.
It is vague as I have not seen the actual pieces but I have
tried to make it serious.  As Empson lives above the place
where the exhibition is to be held I made it pretty fancy
in the hope he sees it.
Also I have finished a first draft of my version of the ballet Isabelle.  I have given it to a woman who knows Anthony
Tudor and she is going to make a few suggestions.  Then I
can make a final version.  It was quite a struggle adapting
the novel.  I think I have hit on one really balletic equiva-
lent for a buried theme in the novel.  In the climactic dance
with Isabelle Gerard starts falling and stumbling like Casimir,
Isabelle's son.
I miss you very much and I hope that you think of me as I
think of you; I find my thoughts turning to you all the time.
I hope you feel confident and happy and not worried.  Are
you sleeping properly?
I came to Wimbledon last night.  I thought I might as well
as I have an early appointment with the dentist today (for
one hour).  Mother has gone to Brighton for a few days with
a girl who is convalescing from scarlet fever (daughter of a
friend of mother's):  tonight I am meeting father in town

The business here for elegies,
the lot being ready to spill on pages
like rain on rivers, water down.
Sounding boards around the throat

to the whole place forced to hear

Every time you turn round a death
has smeared the wallpaper with dead flies.

Elastoplast on the eyeball
shields from seeing the vista shrink,
rolled up towards us like a carpet--
people falling and houses cracking,
where it was grand, things are dusty.

I am not sure how it reads but it is designed, you will
have noticed, as an anti-coronation poem.  Such spleen is
likely to produce poor verse and I don't expect too much
of this.  It does fit with a decline-of-empires passage
in Orpheus and Tangerine however and might provide a rhetorical compliment to the City and Night poem.  We'll see.

My dearest Sylvia:
I am back home from Bath, recalled rather suddenly by a cable
from America. You may remember that I mentioned my synopsis
had been sent to Art News. The editor cabled me that he
wants my article immediately with photographs. So I rushed
back from Bath at once and with one hand I am collecting the
photographs and with the other writing the article (3,000 words).
Although I had collected some material there is still an awful lot
to do, as you will appreciate.

Today, Sunday (I got back yesterday), I have been writing and
revising my article since 10.00 in the morning. It is now 10.00 at night (almost as late as I dare type because of Mrs
Harrison below). I have stopped the post office redirecting
my mail (I think) and Connie will forward to me any letters
of yours that go to Bath.

I was fascinated by the article on Menotti. How does The
Censul fit into the pattern, I wonder? I suppose that the
frustrating male opponent appears directly in it; or does
he? Anyway it was exactly what I needed for my bit about
isolated characters in 20c. milieu.

I have worked with the window open at the bottom all day.
Now there are only the sparkling lights of, let's face it,
Lee and Eltham. They are beautiful at night. One no longer 
hears the moan of the trams that we used to hear when we dined
by the open window: remember? Soon we shall dine by the

Friday Evening
Dearest Sylvia:
Thank you for your story. Written at such speed and prompted as it was by negative reactions, I must say I think it is excellent. Especially I like the way s things go on while the characters speak: there is no unreal suspension during speech. You have 'caught' them, and the social milieu, very well. I do agree with the Woods, however, that it has not quite been taken to the end. I ought to know: it's my idea.
My feelings are mixed: admiration for what you have written; rueful at your deflationary speed and crispness. You make me feel my idea was morbid and fancy and that what I had written was over-written (as it well may be). It is odd to see my idea differently handled, so that I am 'scooped' as well as criticised. My idea was not, as you seem to feel, aimed at us, however obliquely. Its genesis was different. I will write again when I have re-read the story and thought it over carefully.
Carter did not come last night but I spent a very pleasant evening with Magda and John. Definitely, however, I shall see Carter next week. I have another idea for an operetta, somewhere between Hemingway and Offenbach, in which it is likely that Frank could be interested. That I could write straight. I think if I can write the proper things I can get work on TV and Sound. Magda as my agent, in effect.
Your visit to Rye with Beryl sounds enchanting (despite the behavior of the secretary of the Rye Artists).
My lectures have all gone rather nicely. The discussion at Hampstead was not too bad: I adopted an existentialist point of view towards art for the evening, as it was a discussion and I supposed liveliness was expected. I might just as well not have bothered. Nobody knew what I meant and Dennis and Freddie only said what they only too obviously believed in.
I have finished the Sutherland-Moore article. I am, at the moment, terribly pleased with it: I hope I've got Sutherland exactly. However, I may think differently when I see it in print next week. Christ but it was a rush.
If I am not to miss the 7.00 collection I must stop now, but you will get this before the weekend if I go now. So, my darling, my beauty, I love you, I adore you, and am happy that we shall soon meet. I love love love you

What a day. Divine weather. Did you take advantage of it? I'm sure you must have. I'm afraid I didn't. I kept intending to but I seemed to be busy and hesitated to stop. The result is I have written half of the Alan Carter play (including 3 songs). I am seeing him at Magda's tomorrow evening. I like what I have written; I hope they may: and I hope you will.

I agree with what you say about ART NEWS. But I wrote in the last number. Didn't you notice? About Picasso.

Have you the May VOGUE? There is the compact article of James Broughton about England on 'Why the English are so Chinese! It is really rather good and it has given me a useful angle on the sexless type comedy that Ealing Studios produce. Where's the sex? Displaced into cricket, old trains, children's gangs, and so on. Wednesday is the press show of GENEVIEVE. Genevieve is an old car. I read Broughton just in time.

I like working here. It is so nice not to have to go to town. Now, I feel tired but (having worked well) contented. It is 12.30 and pleasantly cool. I have had a bath.

Dearest Sylvia
I read the play at Magda's on Monday and I am relieved to say that the reaction like yours was favourable. Carter thought his idea really amounted to something in my treatment. Frank criticised particular lines but implicit in what he said was the willingness to set it to music. Magda liked it; John said 'excellent' twice. Your criticism of my feeble sense of plot must have impressed me, because I took trouble here and everybody liked its shape.
So that's it. It remains to get TV to accept it. I finish the script and that is what it is sold on (if it is sold) along with Frank's and Carter's reputation. Frank is willing to work with me on projects for sound, too. I have one idea for this - and I propose working out several rough treatments. I am pleased to have the chance of writing this kind of thing. It confirms our theory of adaptability of craftsmanship and it may tap my low side. However, I can imagine your reaction to this so let me, I hope, reassure you with a new poem (a real one). Do not think there is iconoclasm in it, tho' it is called Against Pygmalion. Pygmalion is the dead work of art the artist wishes alive; Frankenstein is the work of art alive with base energy the artist wishes dead.

When the rain comes, when the new skin
Takes life from somewhere unsupposed
And threatens with its life my room,
my habits in a word, I can run
past early refugees to peace
In silence and disgust. Remain
locked up girl on the posed plinths.
Dislocate the springs of my bed;
Rest your fertile arms in my hair;
But only be a muse and not

Blackheath: Sunday

Dearest Sylvia:
It was wonderful to see you again. It made me very
happy. I only wish we could have been together all
afternoon. Still - we got an extra hour when you
missed your train. I do hope that it did not make
you too tired when you finally got home. Did you get
a Pett Level bus and walk up?

Once again, congratulations about your two paintings
being accepted. How well they looked in the show,
pendant and not separated. I am looking forward to
the private view very much.

Today I am staying in and writing. It is 11.00 and
I have already done some more to the TV play, which I
enclose. Then this afternoon I hope to work on the
1st treatment of my sound play and the script of PRIVATE
ROAD. I need to get these started as Frank and Magda - 
and, of course. John - are coming out here on Thursday.
Pasmore is coming to coffee this evening at 9.00. It
will make a nice break.

I hope the Vogue Pattern Book was up to standard. Tell
me anything new or charming in it, won't you? I went to
Charleton House yesterday (which always makes me think
of you), to the Library, and was pleased to find Partisan
Reviews of this year and new Kenyon Reviews too, which I
have borrowed.

I have ideas for poems: one about the cinema beginning
'The lake we fall in - eyes first'. And a poem for
you starting 'All music in a sigh'. But attractive
as these seem to me I am going to write them after I
have done my other work. One strong lion.

I dreamed something about Paul S last night. I really
must get in touch with him. I have not seen him since
we entertained him together last time. I have been
sleeping rather badly the last two nights. That's why
I remember bits of my dreams, like that fragment.

Remember me to Mrs. Hake when you see her and give Beryl
and George my love when you see them.

I am waiting most impatiently to see you again, my love.

I adore you, I love you

Dearest Sylvia:

Thank you so much for your letter which has just come. Forgive me for not writing before but yesterday was terribly busy.

I miss you, too. I am not sleeping so well and I miss you whatever I am doing I love you very much and you are always in my thoughts.

I will 'note the contents' of your letter, as you ask. I will go through it now, point by point.

I am sorry about not coming to Pett but I understand and do not make it awkward for yourself, I beg you. I have made a note about the dates of the holiday, Thursday 30th July to 4th or 5th August. That is a delightful idea. Thank you for thinking of it.

Do congratulate Clifford about the 3 articles: and G. wants 'a steady flow'. That is wonderful.

I am sorry you feel bad but I hope that your social calendar (which seems very full) will distract you. You are in demand.

Yes I will keep my eyes open and my ears to the ground about the Levy's flat, you may be sure.

My Sutherland lecture went well (lots of people) and I have arranged an extra one, making three in all on the exhibition.

Today I am going to the V and A (Moore slides for Petersfield), then lunch with Charles, a press show of Beware, my lovely in the afternoon, and dinner at Wimbledon.

Pasmore came last night, was very nice about the Art News article, and said: 'lawrence, I like the bit on me very much' and borrowed a copy to show Wendy. I plan to do articles on (i) his abstract paintings and (ii) his constrctions. He liked the idea of a Cambridge show very much (I'll tell M.).

I must go to S. Kensington. But before I close this letter let me say again that I miss you and that I adore you.

Take care of yourself, my painter, my love.

I love you

Thank you for your letter this morning, containing the
Britain in Watercolor labels and form. I will make a
note in my diary so that I shall be sure to deliver them.

I hope you still keep well and strong from our holiday.
I know I do, feeling very healthy and strong. Are you
sleeping well? Tell me how you are sleeping.

It is good to hear that M is giving you money for house-
keeping and, of course, I am glad to know that he is
getting stronger. Give him my regards.

I am sorry that you are having tense relations with Tiny.
Really, she is a case. You must let me know about the
Bank Holiday though you come here if it is too hard for
me to come to you. I'd like to come to Pett but the important thing is to be with you.

Have a nice time in Rye, tomorrow (Tuesday).

What pleasant news that you are painting already. I am
glad the sketch has gone well.  Yes, I'm sure something
like Piero's Christ is the thing. I feel a bit doubtful about modern soldiers, but, after all, what can you
do in such a case. It is a puzzle.

Thank you for your letter and for the cutting from the
TIMES. I am getting shy of writing to B'ham for
jobs I don't get, but I shall certainly do so, perhaps
this time successfully.

Your day at Rye sounds most enjoyable as well as pro-
ductive of a watercolor. I'm afraid I don't know the 
view - I only wish I did. Anyway I am glad you have 
painted it.

I hold myself ready for whatever comes at Bank Holiday.
I am pleased the Woods are nicer.

Let me know as soon as you have further details about
the mural. I do hope that this comes off. It would
be good for you and good for the place where the work
is to be done.

My lecture at the ICA seemed to go well - freer, I hope,
than The Human Head one. Despite a charge of puritanism and over-intellectualism (who, me?), I was complimented
by Peter Watson who said he agreed with nearly everything
I said and by (of all people) Richard Hamilton's wife.
Penrose was nice, too, though I think a little bit taken
aback by some of my views. I really knocked Craxton,
Vaughan, Herman, Froy, and Scott. My candour caused
some comment, I think. I had lunch with Rayner Banham
yesterday, by the way: he is nicer than I thought, I
like him increasingly.

Mrs. Hamilton (I forget her 1st name) asked after you and M
and wanted to know how your show had gone. She was pleased at your success.

What other news? I know, Turnbull is not living with his
wife at present (though if the break is likely to be serious, I don't know).

My Watts lecture was surprisingly well attended (so was the
ICA one despite filthy weather and wrong season): I discussed his history and sent him up. Even 18c. Child Portraiture seemed to be popular this afternoon.

thank you for your letter from Rye. I am sorry you were not
able to finish your painting (which I admire very much) but I am
glad that you liked The Titfield Thunderbolt. 
You make me wish to see it, again. 
I thought that you 
might like it, and I'm glad I wasn't wrong. By the way, here 
is the poem I mentioned:

The 2 rails of the branch line, slightly rusty,
cross the marsh, 5 feet above the streams
where waterlilies are, as for dessert.

The funnel rises, like an old top-hat;
the stock a single carriage - green as the weeds
which [unclear]follow [/unclear]sleepers on the single way.

It will not run much longer, tho' it still
can flatten pennies to the [unclear]cruder oval[/unclear]
of older coins pocketed by the earth.

You were absolutely correct about what I was doing at 6.05
on Wednesday - answering questions about Rubens. I
dealt only with the later work - stressing its organic, plan-
tastic character, and also defending the iconological methods
of humanist art. AS you say - there were several people
from the T.G. Today my subject is Giorgione / Titian - 
half lantern slides, half in the gallery itself. I wish you 
were here to discuss it with.

Yesterday I was in the Redfern Gallery making notes on a

arranged it better if I tried. Not surprisingly he invited me

Yesterday went very well.  M was tired and so was I (not late nights - 
but poor sleep)  so conversation was inconsequential  -but charming & I enjoyed myself.  M & VP got on well, I think:  certainly VP 
is being very co-operative.  He is going to visit the gallery & make 
a construction especially for the show.  In addition he is going to 
have 2 pieces in M's sculpture show.

In the evening we saw Buster Keaton in The General and The Balloonatic (you saw the latter with M. I remember).  It was a marvellous 
programme.  Tomorrow I hope to see Harold Lloyd in Safety Last.

My syllabus is complete and I can't see any omissions but I am still 
studying it, hoping for insight and a fresh eye.

Today I am going to [unclear]Quipels[/unclear] to review the abstract exhibition.  I 
have also to get tomorrow's lecture at the T.G. ready.  18thc English 
art:  I must find a new angle on this familiar subject.

I was very interested in MM comparing detective work to unravelling 
story pictures.  It is very true.  The detective works with a sum of 
concrete particulars - which is what a Vict narrative picture is, too.  
I shall most certainly use that.

The weather here is no better than the weather at Pett, I'm afraid.

To judge from your note you are enjoying the Hicks' visit. I am glad of that. Which national trust house are you hoping to visit? I hope you get in. On Sunday I am going to Luton Hoo myself. From the name it must be an owl's stately home.
Today Monica, Peter Kinley, and little Peter are coming out for the afternoon. I am rather looking forward to their visit and it leaves me the morning free for work.

Dearest Sylvia: 
I am sorry M's visit left you depressed. I can understand how that could happen. Although I was only with him a short time Monday, everything seemed rather hard going, somehow. I cannot see quite how to explain it: he just wasn't easy. But he did buy my lunch. And on the surface he was very nice.
Heavens, I had forgotten about the Mountains. thank you for reminding me. I must certainly contact them. I must think up something convincing to tell them.
Your paintings have certainly taken shape quickly. I was so surprised and pleased to learn you had done so much in this morning's letter. (By the way, the Smith cutting you said you enclosed was not there: could I have it by Tuesday, the day of my Smith lecture?)
I have written some more to my article on Ealing films which strengthens my case considerably.
I mentioned that I was working on some poems. Here are some bits and pieces, not final yet, but coming. You may remember the poems on pieces of anatomy: first there is a new section for that, about hands, the hands of clumsy people. I noticed how helpless Chirico's neo-classic figures are: some body suggested it was because of spiritual concerns they are clumsy here:
Helpless in the matter of hands
(everywhere an arena they're lost in)
groping at knobs, adept with lakes in the head 
Where those strong with their hands go drown
applauded by bubbles.

Able to dial within two:
therefore always speaking to strangers,
lost in the sealed kiosk of the skin.

I reached, I must have been miles away.
Instead of a spoon, a glass
of water falls and drips all through the meal.

gummily turn three pages at a time,
Cuban Stories, Asimov, Rousseau,
it wouldn't matter to you starry eye, 
lonely by light years from the signs.

fused fingers slob on mandolins.

Here is a poem to go with another one I wrote about the NEW
YEAR:

The coat hanger crucifies
the coat I've taken off to sit
in nothing in the room, the night
free in the window and next room.

The sacrifice is last year's skin
leaving me, the night's good thief,
free to join the deadest gods
pinned to the rocks of paradise.

What I shall do in latest skin
is what I did in the late day -
happy in the stolen light.

And, finally (though there are other less complete poems), a
poem simply delighting in a number of things:

The good-looking world, I take
that elegant one and all,
as winning numbers and touched cripples,
as a mobile of tomorrow's stars.

So theories of mirrors crack
and towers are plans not tall
I fall in dreams but waking stand, happy 
that every phone's a cardinal's ring.

in the Parallel of Life and Art at the I.C.A. They suggest,
also, in their comfortable human scale, perfectly adjusted to
the hand, rolls from the bakery. There is no suggestion of
the shrunken human head about them.
The human image may be returning in modern sculpture, but
only in certain forms and situations. Footballers have been
replacing unknown political prisoners lately. Geoffrey Clearke's
competition piece is on view at Heffers. It is a real curiosity -
a half-circle of fire-irons, which look like a maddening, up-to-
date version of one of those games of football in amusement
arcades, with robot players who kick when you jerk a handle.
Only Clarke's sculpture has no handle.
Apart from these and other young sculptors, Moore and Hep-
worth are represented. Moore is showing one of those rootless,
panicky experiments which have occupied him lately. A bronze
Mother and Child (1952) reminds one of Lipchitz, especially in
the transformation of the baby into something like a hungry guitar.
Such a transformation of cubism is stale now. Hepworth, unlike
Moore, has continued developing logically, but in her way she, too,
is disappointing: her Small Stone with Strings (1951-52) is
mature but stereotyped.

I was nervous of lecturing at Goldsmiths on work I had never seen before: however, I had all afternoon and I think it went well. It was not the art school, but the annual show of the art club of the student-teachers. Nothing outstanding: but a good level of pleasant feeling: you know. I awarded prizes, commended others and was relieved to hear my taste coincided with the teachers' views (on the whole). Was interested to meet myself in miniature: young, unshaven, shy [unclear]blonde[/unclear], a bit aggressive. (Gave him a prize).

As they paid me there and then here I am in the Gaumont restaurant, Lewisham eating supper. Alas, no sound of the film (White Witch Doctor).

I know it is hideous but it has a tiny account of poignancy and pure history already. I am not going to the film afterwards: having refused to go to Intolerance with the Cordells I am on my way home to continue with the Italian article.

Unless we can get a big reduction in price I don't think we should count on doing the interior ourselves & having the Kinleys ready to move in as assets to outweigh everything else.

I will go into Foster & Foster tomorrow & talk it over with them. (I wish I could have gone today but it is 9.30 and I am in town already.)

13249887,gri_2003_m_46_b06_f11_023.jpg,"The Pedagogical Sketchbook was published in 1925, drawn from a mass of material prepared by Klee for his teaching course at the Weimar Bauhaus.  It seems to me that this symposium is bound to deal with three points: (1) to what extent it the Sketchbook a product of the Bauhaus; (2) how closely do Klee's words fit his own art; and (3) , is the Sketchbook significant now, nearly 30 years since it was published?  Matters of art-education, art-history, and the psychology of artistic creation are involved.
The Sketchbook was part of the preliminary 6 month course which included instruction in problems of form and experiments in the handling of different media. The student's aptitude for a particular craft showed itself in this period and, at the same time, the student acquired a basic vocabulary of form. In addition, of course, it was essential to liberative students from conventional art habits.  This is what Klee does in the Pedagogical Sketchbook - he offers a vocabulary and grammar of form that is pedagogic and anti-academic simultaneously.  This was not Klee's only activity at the Bauhaus but it was his most fruitful one.  He was in charge of the metal workshops for a time, the students turning out under his direction 'spiritual samovars and intellectual doorknobs' (1). Moholy-Nagy took over in this workshop in 1923 and changed to the mass-production of lighting-fixtures.
However, though Klee, with Kandinski and Feininger, were deficient as technicians their role in the Bauhaus was essential.",0,FALSE
13249888,gri_2003_m_46_b06_f11_024.jpg,"It was not the purpose of the Bauhaus to train specialists but to provide sound, broad foundations for the student's personal work.  Klee fitted this pattern by offering in the Sketchbook 'basic clarities and points of departure'. The Bauhaus ideal of educating the individual in the interests of the community was obviously in Klee's mind when he wrote in a lecture (published in 1925): 'The people are not with us.'  But we seek a people.  We began over at the Bauhaus'.  On the other hand, a weaker point in the bauhaus structure was Gropius' belief in the possibility of a total-work of art, an architectural rather than a musical composite but basically a Wagnerian fancy.
Giedion relates Klee with the Bauhaus from another angle.  He points out that the Pedagogical Sketchbook is shaped by concerns similar to those working in the technical parts of the school.  In Klee's theory 'everything is the outcome of movement' (2),  and technological movement -from adjustable furniture to the gestures of the assembly line - occupied the technicians.  Though Moholy Nagy has been represented as the Bauhaus 'champion of youth' (3) compared to the fuddy-duddy mystics Klee and Kandinski, both in their 40s, the fundamental link is there.  As early as 1919 Klee was concerned with 'the dynamics and psychology of line' and defined rest as 'an accidental obstruction of matter' (4).
Klee and Kandinski both took Bauhaus students in the important",0,FALSE
13249890,gri_2003_m_46_b06_f11_026.jpg,"4
Klee's incisive diagrams and pointed captions in the Sketch-
book express his dynamic world-view. He defines line as a
point shifting its position and plane as the progression of
a line. He develops this aesthetic of movement step by step
through more complex formal elements. He applies categories
of active, medial, and passive to a range of phenomena, such
as the relationship of muscle and bone, to the blood stream,
a waterfall, a plant. These categories are not fixed; for
example, the waterfall is active because it turns the water-
wheel but medial because it moves as it does owing to the active
forces of gravity and obstructing mountain. By extension,
the world can be defined as an endless series of manifold functions. Form, therefore, is the result of change and growth.

The Pedagogical Sketchbook represents this aspect of Klee's
thought brilliantly and it is, of course, a point of fundamental importance in modern art. The Sketchbook is only a frag-
ment, however: perhaps that is the reason for the disappointment of the last section. Or, it may be that because, in the
1920s, drawing was as important to Klee as painting, color lagged behind line in his formulas. Color has always been the
most intractable element in aesthetics. From a colorist of
Klee's genius it was legitimate to hope for more than a conventional circle of the spectrum. Not only is this a serious let-
down after the preceding original diagrams it is a contradiction
of Klee's dynamic world-view. The color-wheel symbolises light",0,FALSE
13249891,gri_2003_m_46_b06_f11_027.jpg,"5
by means of opaque colored surfaces only. Here Klee is static
whereas his line and plane are dynamic. His signs for movement
and signs in movement are not supported by color in his theory.
On the other hand, composition, another component of the Design
section of the Bauhaus curriculum, is brilliantly, though indirectly, covered, because to Klee the work of art is an image of movement. Therefore space is 'a temporal conception'. The
classes of active-medial-passive are all time-functions.
Klee wrote: 'When I came to be a teacher I had to account explicitly for what I had been used to doing unconsciously' (7).
Actually, Klee was theoretically oriented before Gropius invited him to join the Bauhaus in January, 1921. His main theoretical period is ca.1918-25. As I say, the Sketchbook defines beautifully a dynamic world-view and offers advice on all
but one of the methods with which to express space as time.
However, Klee has omitted another quality from the Sketchbook
which is as essential to his art as color: phantasy has been
excluded from these elementary exercises. Magic in art is a
quality that, if you have it, you can't get rid of and lacking
it, you can't pick it up. The element of phantasy and the mysterious arrival of images, discussed in another book by Klee
in 1925, is excluded as personal. This voluntary suppression
by the artist of a part of his personality helps, I think, to
keep this book significant today. The Lady Demon, the Park near
Lu, the Stricken Town, the Magicians in Dispute are Klee's pro-",0,FALSE

It is difficult to characterise a year's painting with
much certainty.  Easel painting is, by its very nature, individualistic and experimental- the product of the artist
in his studio, free of the dictates of patronage.  To impose
a fixed form on the most changeable of art forms is no easy
task.  One must even take into account the time-lag between
the canvas, wet on the artist's easel, and the same work hanging, framed, in a gallery.  However, provisional contours may
be indicated.
The popularity of non-figurative art (loosely called abstract
art) was undiminished in 1953.  Abstract art is truly cosmo-
politan in the way that Gothic and Mannerism were international.
Italy, Scandinavia, France, Britain, despite local differences,
had much in common: Serge Poliakov and Willam Scott, Hans Hartung and Giuseppe Santomaso, for example, link Paris and London,
Paris and Venice by their stylistic affinities.  Abstract art
has many degrees, many shades of formal meaning: during the year
Nicholas de Stael's sensual painterliness and Max Bill's linear
exactitude were both influential (the former more so).
Probably the most significant phase of post war abstract art
was the revival and extension of Abstract Expressionism, a movement with strong American allegiances,  In France a group was
sponsored by Michel Tapie- whose book Un Art Autre circulated in
1953.  In spirit the group was vehement, dark, expressionistic.
Their art was intended less as a style than as a series of ges-

tures of existential individualism, less as a reflective work than as an anguished act with paint and canvas. Jackson Pollock
influenced some of these artists. In Paris this attitude
to creation was expressed by Jean-Paul Riopelle, Georges Mathieu,
Henri Michaux, and others. In England, the most conspicuous
exponents of this anti-formal art were Alan Davie and Gerald Wilde.

The 'aformal' artists considered most modern art manneristic.
Modern German painting supported their view: though there was a great deal of German painting to be seen in 1953, most of it was either oriented to the recent past or rather superficially derivative from other countries. Influences of the pre-war Bauhaus and post-war Paris conflict: though the Germans were free to experiment, no recognisable national style, comparable to that of the pre-Nazi years, emerged. Even Karl Hofer's recent work lacked the admirable purposefulness and strength of his earlier painting.

There were many other aesthetic attitudes in Europe in 1953, besides the individualism of the 'aformalists' and the eclecticism of the Germans. Typical of post-war aesthetics (in some quarters) is the narrowing-down of modern art. For example, the Ecole d'Aix - a group of artists let by Pierre Tal Coat, gathered like pilgrims round the cave-mouth at Bibemus. Faced with their misty abstracted scenes the question arose: was this a consolidation of a position won years ago, or was Cenzanne's real achievement being dissipated by a decadent excess of refinement? Late Euston Road realists in England suggested similar doubts.",0,FALSE
13249904,gri_2003_m_46_b06_f12_010.jpg,"PAINTING3

There are even more fine distinctions in realism in painting than in abstract art.  It is necessary to distinguish between conservative realism and revolutionary realism, between late impressionism and near-expressionism, between sensational and analytical artists.  It is enough, however, in this place, to record that realism continued in 1953 as before, without remarkable gains or losses.  One of the most impressive of the realists is the least assertive, least doctrinaire of them: L. S. Lowry, whose Manchester scenes reveal a rare feeling for the movement of crowds in an industrial city.  Apart from occasional pure landscapes and portraits, Lowry creates fine images of collective man - an essentially 20th century concern for an artist.
Picasso continued to draw his material from family life, but in a new manner.  He cut down the rich, garrulous ornament of his cloisonne style but the impression of slightness and speed of execution (marked in his work since the Antibes period) persisted.  His new family pictures were spare and flat, related to the War and Peace pictures of 1952, though more concentrated and coherent.  The general feeling seemed to be that Picasso is not in one of his great phases: his art showed a restless industry and ingenuity rather than a firm purpose of universal significance.  Braque's new work, on the other hand, is a patient and grave development of his life-long concern with the inter-relationship of pictorial space and the painted surface, of exact ambiguities, as fine and as French as a paradox of",0,FALSE

Surrealism (perhaps because it has been so successfully
assimilated into our culture-pattern) is no longer a potent
force, even in Paris, though the diminished movement still
has gifted adherents, such as Victor Brauner & Jacques [unclear]Heicel [/unclear]. One could not
avoid feeling that the real artistic drive was elsewhere, however - for example, in the 'aformal' painters who were influenced by surrealist automatism. English neo-romanticism 
(a compound of English nature-romanticism and School of
Paris surrealism) is still influential. Graham Sutherland's 
new paintings had a savage darkness and power that was very impressive after the empty brilliance of his Mediterranean period. ",0,FALSE

Happy Christmas my darling: I love you so much, and though we are not together I feel as if you were here, as I joyfully anticipate our future Christmases together.

Let me tell you my Christmas movements: Christmas Eve at Magda's (sleeping overnight); then to Wimbledon, where I shall stay from Christmas day until Sunday night or Monday morning.  I shall definitely be back here on Monday.  I shall not be away as long as usual.

I am so pleased to hear that you persuaded Diana to go to the Rye artists' party and glad it was enjoyable.

Your presents from your aunts sound marvellous.  I have done well from my Tate Gallery people: two two guinea book tokens.  With one I have bought A GRAMMAR OF MOTIVE by Kenneth Burke.  You know how I like him.

Your party with the Savages and Diana sounds so nice: I wish I could have been there.  George with whiskey as usual.

Early today I went to Wimbledon and put up the Christmas decorations, just vegetation of various kinds: I did my best to make indoor trees and arches since the holly, from the garden, was exceptionally large.

Pasmore fell off his bicycle the other day and has fractured his hip.  This means no exh. at Cambridge and he will miss a term at Newcastle: also he didn't come to me for coffee.  I'm visiting him after Christmas.  Isn't it a shame!

Lion is helping Magda out with silver for tomorrow so I must go and polish it.  Ho-hum.

I have some ideas for, or rather feelings for, poems.  I hope I may have a chance to get something done in the next few days.

I had long and delightful dreams about you last night and hope for more of the same tonight.  I think of you all day too you may be sure.  You are my life and my dream.  I love and adore you.  Happy Christmas and all my love.

Dearest Lawrence,
I begin at last to lose my cold, though I feel dreadfully tired and slept so badly last night that I read until 5 o'clock. I hope that I sleep better today. I hope you are well and not over tired with all your lecturing. I hope you are more pleased this time with your Matisse. What did you lecture on at Bamstead? How many people managed to come to the Wallace Collection? Clifford said that if he could he would go to one of your lectures on Thursday or Friday. I  wonder if he will!

I finished Blacker yesterday and

hope to send it back to you by Tuesday.
And thank you so much for letting me
 have it and for renewing it for

have to - but there is that possibility
of lecturing to the W.I. in March

as well make the necessary notes so

How nice it was this morning to have a letter from you.
I long to meet you on Saturday and shall be at the station -
heavily [unclear]be-rugged[/unclear] - to meet the 12.58.

Your evening lecture seems to have been a rare success - an
extra guinea, and those charming words of praise overheard as
you left. Oh, my Minerva, warmest congratulations. I am
sorry the other class are aggressive about modern pictures and
poetry - but I am sure you cope with them (I remember the
Henry Moore / Shakespeare incident that Tiny quoted) though, of
course, it is a useless strain.

I am writing in Shepherd's Bush library - where the exhibition is being held. The staff of the library reveal an extraordinary pattern of malice and jealousy and cross currents of egotism
and stupidity that is almost unbelievable disturbed. I was
introduced to it on my first morning here, everybody complaining about everybody else.

I saw John Shipp yesterday and he admired my ring very 
much - as did John McHale. Yes, he sent the testimonial in
the end, he was away with influenza when my letter reached 
the office.

I am much too busy possibly to see the clock at present - I
just cannot afford the time. I thought, in any case, M's brisk, yet
abstracted air, when he and I did meet not in the least charming.

The AIA committee is not yet decided - more people
were proposed than there is room for and so there is to
be a ballot. Perhaps I shall survive it - I hope so.

I have not survived as far as the Ken Wood job goes -
I heard unofficially that the short list people have already
been interviewed.

When I got there Sir Osbert was just sending his secretary off: they had been answering letters. He told me he had replied to a letter from one public character in these terms:

Dear Sir,
thank you for your stupid letter...

I shall tell you lots more about him when we meet.

I got your tea yesterday. I bought the more expensive lap-sang and had them send it here. Or do you want it at Pett? If so you can have the cheaper brand, if you want it, from my book, this month.

How very shocking about Hinds' packing. I'm glad you told me. I had no time yesterday but tomorrow I shall go into them indignantly. See fig ii.

Dearest Sylvia, 

Your letter upset me because I do not know when you are 
going to come here.  You say 'if I do not come before the 
end of the month'.  You left here on the 23rd August.  Do 
you intend to stay away longer than a month?

The agreement was that you were going to live with me
and still see Michael - not the other way round.  You say
you will be in Pett most of November.  Have you remembered that if I do St Albans and you Hammersmith we shall not
see much of each other during the latter part of October.
Therefore, as your suggestions stand I shall see you for
about two weeks in October (Hammersmith starts 15th of that
month).  Then, when it's over, back to Pett.

I am sure you cannot have realised the implications of 
your letter.

Staying away longer than I anticipated, defining the time
you will  be here only by saying when you are going back to
Pett, make me unhappy.

Your picture for st Nicholas seems to me a gesture of 
atonement to the father-symbol (church and michael) to 
whom you have been unfaithful with me.  On that level I 
am sorry it is necessary.  On the other hand I think that 
on the technical level it is a good opportunity to work on 
a large scale.  I am sure it will be exciting in light 
and colour.  Your sketch is very interesting.

Please do think carefully about the next two months.  
I never allow writing or lectures to interfere with us and 
I do hope that you will not do this now.  Is not Hammer-
smith enough?  It is a good thing to be offered the lectures and I am very pleased but think of them in relation 
to ourselves.

(If, as seems likely, you can think of a compromise

My dearest Sylvia - 
I want to write you a long letter but I have not had time - getting my lecture ready, and seeing John. He wants me to improve and re-organise the exhibition I was with at St Albans. Details in my next letter.
I do hope that your long journey was not too uncomfortable and that everybody got out at Tunbridge Wells!
It is about four and I must see Charles J. in a few moments but I much say how much I love you. Last night- when I got home - I Was soothed by our room now that it is well-arranged, and all your pictures.
Tomorrow, my love, a proper letter. I hope you are happy and not divided - look after yourself.

Dearest Sylvia,

I am glad my poems please you. You have the rebus right
as far as you go but there is another word in it. Here
is another poem - a Wintry one - without any riddles (the
third lines means the begonia):

Tonight we cannot sleep with the doors open
For wind will tear the pages of the books
Impair the equilibrium of flowers
And shuttle icebergs down the lovers' spines

Inside the mountain guiltless Venusberg
Lovers survive despite the distant sun
And for the Winter we must love behind 
The frosted panes of glass and undercover

'What a pity', says Hetty, 'that I am not suitable for
the portrait exhibition'. I think she is tired of only
having me to admire her and wishes for your good opinion again.

The exhibition for John is finished and he likes it.
Miss Chick must read it and then we have to see Gabriel
White about it in whom rests the LAST WORD. It took
up a lot of my time early this week; Wednesday I had
two lectures (the school one dull, Banstead successful) and Thursday I went to see Gainsborough. He wants
me to do a regular fortnightly column covering the
sale rooms. It will mean a constant two guinea
cheque. I have also reviewed the Towne exhibition
for Gainsborough:  he asked after you last time I saw 
him.

The LSE class, did I tell you? I can't remember, was a
success and they want me to go again next term.

I gather Tiny is away so perhaps she did not read
my letter containing a slip of the material I bought
for her.  I forgot to tell her the price:  it is
4s. 6d. a yard, there is nothing cheaper: they say
Tiny must have invented anything cheaper.

I assure you if I don't see you soon I shall sweep
you off as Hades did Persephone.  I adore you and
am longing to see you.  I hope I shall find you
less disturbing than last time:  I am thinking very
seriously about what to wear.

Dearest Sylvia,

   I am sorry that so many letters of mine have contained catalogues of all the work I am doing. It has prevented me from writing quite as much as I would wish, to you, my dearest one. Do forgive me.
   Your cake was waiting for me when I got home last night's. I have not eaten any yet, I was too late, and this morning I am going out in a few minutes, so I shall open it this evening and eat vast pieces of it on my return from Banstead. Thank you, darling, so much for sending it. I feel terribly, wonderfully, spoiled. I shall be very fat, I'm sure, when we meet: four eggs!

   I am glad to hear that you are getting on well with your portrait of the girl: that, and Tiny, make two pictures of yours I have not seen yet. Your Muse is most indignant.  Or almost indignant. 

   How excited I am about the Kensington Gallery. I shall go there tomorrow morning, immediately after my N.G. lecture which will be over at 11.30. I shall get there by 12. Think of my arrival, for, assuredly nothing but you and your pictures will be in my thoughts. I shall send Gainsborough the review that same evening so it'll be in time for the next issue.
   I hope that preparations for your lectures are going smoothly. I am sure they are for I remember how quickly and well we worked together. Oh, that I could be there. I shall think of you my darling and send you my love all the time, be assured of that. 
   I love you, madly, intellectually, impulsively, constantly, I love love love you, Lawrence

Dearest Sylvia,

Your letter is rather confusing about the lectures.  Thank you for offering to take one of the
engagements if I should be busy (I adore you for
thinking of that) but I hope it will not be necessary.

I have accepted Hammersmith.  Do I take your
letter to mean that we should each do a course -
I at St. Albans and you at Hammersmith?  If you
think this is a good idea I will ask John Skipp.
I am not sure that our finances would compel you
to do that, though, and guide-lecturing is a bore.
Tell me more clearly what you mean.  I'm sorry to
be so dense.

Your suggestions about reviewing are all congenial to me but not many books are sent to Art News
and Review, at present, and certainly neither of
those you mention have gone to Gainsborough.  I
wish they had.  The publishers have not accepted
the paper wholeheartedly yet, you see.

What very good news about your cliff painting.
I am glad St. Nicholas is being so useful.  You should have some more news of it soon - I look forward to your next letter describing your progress.
Here is a poem - quite a slight one, I admit - about
it:

Yes, my darling, please do the Dutch Interiors and Genre scenes. We shall soon be quite rich if we go on working like this.

By the way, Castleford, appears to be in Yorkshire, near Leeds but I think if we went there now and then on to Scotland it would rather deplete again the money I hope to build up. If we go next year - when the engagement is longer than a week - we should be able to have the trip more conveniently, I think. I looked Redcar up on the map and it is over two-thirds of the way to Edinbrugh.

I really feel rather tired. After breakfast I went back to bed and slept for a while. It is lunch time and I must do some work. Before I fell asleep, however, I read an amusing 18th century version of a Moliere play called 'The Cit Turned Gentleman' (part of the Hogarth background). Can you guess which play of Moliere's it is that is thus entitled in English?

My parents gave me milk-chocolate, butter and ham from France. I have the decanter and the two plates. Mother is resisting about the trays but I am sure of the small one. The decanter looks very well now it's washed. You were, of course, right.

Dearest Sylvia,

    Last night I went to the AIA and the Committee meeting lasted for 2 and a half hours.I am going to another one tomorrow. I think this one will be shorter as a lecture by Ruhemann on  cleaned pictures starts at eight. Am I not the lion of love, sitting on such committees for my cat. Forgive my former slackness . . .
    This morning I have been working on Joyce, in bed, because I am tired. It progresses very slowly. I am turning into a slow-coach-erie. 
    Have you painted any Spring watercolours? Gay yellow daffodillies are out here, looking very pretty and fresh. 
    I have no slides for this evening but I hope the slices of Mrs Smith will make up for my omission. Would you were coming. . .
    I love you so much. I think of you all the time, lovingly, sometimes fearfully, always adoringly. My sweet Minerva, how I hate the separation and complications attendant on our love. But - how I love you. 
    I am happy to be writing poems for you and about you again. There had been a dull patch which seems to be breaking as the Spring advances. How you inspire me to write.

Dearest Sylvia, How good to talk with you this morning, for so long a time which yet passed, for me, so quickly.  Here are three poems for you, my Muse who inspires me so generously.  I must thank you for them, my love.  Today the poet in his landscape, Landscape with telephones, Remembers the blue duel of the boats, The women in the trains at night, The rattle of the couplings, And burning names of biscuits Visionary in the sky.  My love is nearer by a world: Streets could hide her by a block, A pause at red-eyed traffic-lights Might be fatal to a meeting.  All the houses should wear blue plaques Saying 'your love is here, or near', oh where, In the labyrinthine city, love.  TWO When the stars creak like trees in the wind And the floor mumbles its age And you cannot reach the switch To put off the light in your mind Let lions take the place of sheep And blow dust back in the past's face And persuade to honeyed peace My wakeful beauty: let lions fill your sleep  THREE Spring is not academic, A footnote or a time Fixed in the almanac Past which there is no rime.  Nor quite the rising heads of daffodils that hear The song of birds With their long yellow ears.  Spring is the time we meet, In garden, room, or street,, For images, then, fly Like flowers from your hair, Like birds from my thighs Growing into air.

ceased at the Vernal or thereabouts' (Aubrey).

Autumn is said to be a poet's time,
When walking through the orchards poets
Are stunned by falling fruit: imagination.
Miltonic grandeur of colour
Blazons the landscape of a Fall.

Early while the morning's wet
Is the time to write; early
Before the dinner-gong wounds the silence;
Or in the early morning ringed
By a solar system of candles.

The country's best where there is a sense
Of order in the metrical grass-hop:
Though in the city moving figures
Occupy the poet's anti-self
Even as he launches the dazzling image.

Naked but for a straw hat,
Glareglasses on against the rhymes
Strong in this part of the afternoon,
The poet follows figures of ships that curve
Half on the water, half on air.

Or Egyptian in one room
Above the cracked and splintering river,
Warmed by the contrast of fire and snow,
He write a sestina in six hours,
About the lion of summer in his cage.

Now the painter can erect her easel
Among the daffodils and transparent clouds
And paint the flowered dresses and their girls,
Agile or languorous, and poets
Pursue the colour-adjectives.",0,FALSE

In boats or on the silhouetted bridges,
Pacing the room or prone to lazing,
In the circular museum,
Listening to music, failing to sleep,
The poet hunts or bribes the poem.

Subjects from Orlando tempt,
A still-life whispers in the light,
Will no-one revive topography,
Animals wait to spring in the tree of day,
And images make fruit in every minute.

Sylvia is my time and place,
My season and my equinox,
My landscape and my favourite position,
Erotic, physical, amusing,

Supporting the blonde stairs.

Nor you the caryatid
With her smiling upraised arms:
Tell me of him, not leave him hid.

take it this is a pretty recent draft.

This sounds very like a magazine proposal.  Is it?

because it is about Sylvia, but for the context of
related contemporaries and as a chart of her
development.  It is the kind of prose I like to write.
